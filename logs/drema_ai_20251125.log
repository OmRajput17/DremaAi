a)	 Interactive mode 
b)	 Script mode

(A)	 Interactive Mode
In the interactive mode, we can type a Python statement 
on the >>> prompt directly. As soon as we press enter, 
the interpreter executes the statement and displays the 
result(s), as shown in Figure 3.2.

Working in the interactive mode is convenient for

(B)	 Script Mode
In the script mode, we can write a Python program in 
a file, save it and then use the interpreter to execute 
the program from the file. Such program files have 
a .py extension and they are also known as scripts.

By default, the Python scripts are saved in the Python 
installation folder.

Notes 3.2	 Python Keywords

Keywords are reserved words. Each keyword has a 
specific meaning to the Python interpreter. As Python 
is case sensitive, keywords must be written exactly as 
given in Table 3.1.

Table 3.1 Python keywords
False class finally is return
None continue for lambda try
True def from nonlocal while
and del global not with
as elif if or yield
assert else import pass  
break except in raise  

3.3	 Identifiers
In programming languages, identifiers are names used 
to identify a variable, function, or other entities in a 
program. The rules for naming an identifier in Python 
are as follows: 
•	 The name should begin with an uppercase or a 

lowercase alphabet or an underscore sign (_). This 
may be followed by any combination of characters 
a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or underscore (_). Thus, an identifier 
cannot start with a digit.

•	 It can be of any length. (However, it is preferred to 
keep it short and meaningful). 

•	 It should not be a keyword or reserved word given in 
Table 3.1.

•	 We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, %, etc. 
in identifiers.
For example, to find the average of marks obtained 

by a student in three subjects namely Maths, English, 
Informatics Practices (IP), we can choose the identifiers 
as marksMaths, marksEnglish, marksIP and avg 
rather than a, b, c, or A, B, C, as such alphabets do not 
give any clue about the data that variable refers to.

avg = (marksMaths + marksEnglish + marksIP)/3

3.4	 Variables

Variable is an identifier whose value can change. For 
example  variable age can have  different  value for 
different person. Variable name should be unique in a 
program. Value of a variable can be string (for example,

those data. Figure 3.6 enlists the data types available 
in Python.

Dictionaries

Figure 3.6:	Different Data Types in Python
3.5.1	Number
Number data type stores numerical values only. It is 
further classified into three different types: int, float 
and complex.

Table 3.2 Numeric data types
Type/ Class Description Examples

int integer numbers -12, -3, 0, 123, 2
float floating point numbers -2.04, 4.0, 14.23

complex complex numbers 3 + 4i, 2 - 2i

Boolean data type (bool) is a subtype of integer. It 
is a unique data type, consisting of two constants, True 
and False. Boolean True value is non-zero. Boolean 
False is the value zero.

Let us now try to execute few statements in interactive 
mode to determine the data type of the variable using 
built-in function type().
Example 3.1	

>>> quantity = 10
>>> type(quantity)
<class 'int'>

>>> Price = -1921.9
>>> type(price)
<class 'float'>

Variables of simple data types like integer, float, boolean 
etc. hold single value. But such variables are not useful 
to hold multiple data values, for example, names of the 
months in a year, names of students in a class, names 
and numbers in a phone book or the list of artefacts in a 
museum. For this, Python provides sequence data types like 
Strings, Lists, Tuples, and  mapping data type Dictionaries.

where each item is indexed by an integer value. Three

Brief Overview of Python 37

types of sequence data types available in Python are Notes
Strings, Lists and Tuples. A brief introduction to these 
data types is as follows:
(A)	 String 
String is a group of characters. These characters may be 
alphabets, digits or special characters including spaces. 
String values are enclosed either in single quotation 
marks (for example ‘Hello’) or in double quotation marks 
(for example “Hello”). The quotes are not a part of the 
string, they are used to mark the beginning and end of 
the string for the interpreter. For example,  

>>> str1 = 'Hello Friend'
>>> str2 = "452"

We cannot perform numerical operations on strings, 
even when the string contains a numeric value. For 
example str2 is a numeric string.
(B)	 List 
List is a sequence of items separated by commas and 
items are enclosed in square brackets [ ]. Note that 
items may be of different date types.

Example 3.2	
#To create a list
>>> list1 = [5, 3.4, "New Delhi", "20C", 45] 	
#print the elements of the list list1	
>>> list1     
[5, 3.4, 'New Delhi', '20C', 45]

(C)	 Tuple 
Tuple is a sequence of items separated by commas and 
items are enclosed in parenthesis ( ). This is unlike list, 
where values are enclosed in brackets [ ]. Once created, 
we cannot change items in the tuple. Similar to List, 
items may be of different data types.
Example 3.3	

#create a tuple tuple1
>>> tuple1 = (10, 20, "Apple", 3.4, 'a')    
#print the elements of the tuple tuple1
>>> print(tuple1)   
(10, 20, "Apple", 3.4, 'a')

3.5.3	Mapping
Mapping is an unordered data type in Python. Currently, 
there is only one standard mapping data type in Python 
called Dictionary.

38 Informatics Practices – Class XI

(A)	 Dictionary 
Dictionary in Python holds data items in key-value pairs 
and Items are enclosed in curly brackets { }. dictionaries 
permit faster access to data. Every key is separated from 
its value using a colon (:) sign. The key value pairs of 
a dictionary can be accessed using the key. Keys are 
usually of string type and their values can be of any data 
type. In order to access any value in the dictionary, we 
have to specify its key in square brackets [ ].
Example 3.4	

#create a dictionary
>>> dict1 = {'Fruit':'Apple', 
'Climate':'Cold', 'Price(kg)':120}   
>>> print(dict1)
{'Fruit': 'Apple', 'Climate': 'Cold', 
'Price(kg)': 120}
#getting value by specifying a key

Python compares two >>> print(dict1['Price(kg)'])
strings lexicographically 120

supports several kind of operators, their categorisation 
is briefly explained in this section.
3.6.1	Arithmetic Operators
Python supports arithmetic operators (Table 3.3) to 
perform the four basic arithmetic operations as well as 
modular division, floor division and exponentiation.

'+' operator can also be used to concatenate two 
strings on either side of the operator.

>>> str1 = "Hello"
>>> str2 = "India"
>>> str1 + str2
'HelloIndia'

'*' operator repeats the item on left side of the 
operator if first operand is a string and second operand 
is an integer value.

>>> str1 = 'India'
>>> str1 * 2
'IndiaIndia'

Table 3.3 Arithmetic operators in Python
Operator Operation Description Example (Try in Lab)

+ Addition Adds two numeric values on >>> num1 = 5
either side of the operator >>> num2 = 6

>>> num1 + num2
11

- Subtraction Subtracts the operand on the >>> num1 = 5
right from the operand on the left >>> num2 = 6

>>> num1 - num2
-1

* Multiplication Multiplies the two values on both >>> num1 = 5
sides of the operator >>> num2 = 6

>>> num1 * num2
30

/ Division Divides the operand on the left >>> num1 = 5
by the operand on the right of the >>> num2 = 2
operator and returns the quotient >>> num1 / num2

2.5
% Modulus Divides the operand on the left >>> num1 = 13

by the operand on the right and >>> num2 = 5
returns the remainder >>> num1 % num2

Operators (+) and (*) work in similar manner for other 
sequence data types like list and tuples. 
3.6.2	Relational Operators
Relational operator compares the values of the operands 
on its either side and determines the relationship among 
them. Conside the given Python variables num1 = 10, 
num2 = 0, num3 = 10, str1 = "Good", str2 = 
"Afternoon" for the following examples in Table 3.4:

>>> num1 != num2
If values of two operands are not True

!= Not equal to equal, then condition is True, >>> st r1 != str2
otherwise it is False True

>>> num1 != num3
False

If the value of the left operand is >>> num1 > num2

> Greater than greater than the value of the right True
operand, then condition is True,  >>> st r1 > str2
otherwise it is False. True
If the value of the left operand is 

< Less than less than the value of the right >>> num1 < num3
operand, the condition is true False
otherwise it is False

Similarly, there are other relational operators like <= 
and >=.
3.6.3	Assignment Operators
Assignment operator assigns or changes the value of 
the variable on its left, as shown in Table 3.5.

Table 3.5 Assignment operators in Python
Operator Description Example (Try in Lab)

= Assigns value from right side operand to left >>> num1 = 2
side operand >>> num2 = num1

>>> num2

>>> country = 'India'
>>> country
'India'

+= It adds the value of right side operand to the left >>> num1 = 10
side operand and assigns the result to the left >>> num2 = 2
side operand. >>> num1 += num2
Note: x+ = y  is same as x = x + y >>> num1

12
>>> num2
2

-= It subtracts the value of right side operand >>> num1 = 10
from the left side operand and assigns the >>> num2 = 2
result to left side operand. >>> num1 -= num2
Note: x− = y is same as x = x − y >>> num1

8

Similarly, there are other assignment operators like 
*=, /=, %=, //=, and **=.
3.6.4	Logical Operators
There are three logical operators (Table 3.6) supported 
by Python. These operators (and, or, not) are to be 
written in lower case only. The logical operator evaluates 
to either True or False based on the logical operands 
on its either side.

Notes 3.7.1	Precedence of Operators
So far we have seen different operators and examples 
of their usage. When an expression contains more than 
one operator, their precedence (order or hierarchy) 
determines which operator should be applied first. 
Higher precedence operator is evaluated before the 
lower precedence operator. In the following example, '*' 
and '/' have higher precedence than '+' and '-'.
Note:

a)	 Parenthesis can be used to override the precedence of 
operators. The expression within () is evaluated first.

b)	 For operators with equal precedence, the expression 
is evaluated from left to right.

Example 3.5	 How will Python evaluate the following 
expression? 

         20 + 30 * 40
       Solution:
                       #precedence of * is more than that of + 
             = 20 + 1200     	     #Step 1
             = 1220         	     #Step 2
Example 3.6	 How will Python evaluate the following 

expression? 
         (20 + 30) * 40

       Solution:
      	 = (20 + 30) * 40          	 # Step 1 
	 #using parenthesis(), we have forced  
	 precedence of + to be more than that of * 
	 = 50 * 40                          	 # Step 2
 	 = 2000                                 	 # Step 3
Example 3.7	 How will the following expression be 

evaluated?
	       15.0 / 4.0 + (8 + 3.0)

3.8	 Input and Output 
Sometimes, we need to enter data or enter choices into 
a program. In Python, we have the input() function 
for taking values entered by input device such as a 
keyboard. The input() function prompts user to enter 
data. It accepts all user input (whether alphabets,

numbers or special character) as string. The syntax for Notes
input() is: 

variable = input([Prompt])
Prompt is the string we may like to display on the 

screen prior to taking the input, but it is optional. The 
input() takes exactly what is typed from the keyboard, 
converts it into a string and assigns it to the variable on 
left hand side of the assignment operator (=). 
Example 3.8	

>>> fname = input("Enter your first name: ")
Enter your first name: Arnab
>>> age = input("Enter your age: ")
Enter your age: 19

The variable fname gets the string ‘Arnab’ as input. 
Similarly, the variable age gets '19' as string. We can 
change the datatype of the string data accepted from 
user to an appropriate numeric value. For example, the 
int() function will convert the accepted string to an 
integer. If the entered string is non-numeric, an error 
will be generated.
Example 3.9	

#function int() to convert string to integer
>>> age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
Enter your age: 19
>>> type(age)
<class 'int'>

Python uses the print() function to output data 
to standard output device — the screen. The function 
print() evaluates the expression before displaying it 
on the screen. The syntax for print() is: 

print(value)

Example 3.10	
Statement Output

print("Hello") Hello
print(10*2.5) 25.0

Notes 3.9.1	Syntax Errors
Like any programming language, Python has rules that 
determine how a program is to be written. This is called 
syntax. The interpreter can interpret a statement of a 
program only if it is syntactically correct. For example, 
parentheses must be in pairs, so the expression (10 + 
12) is syntactically correct, whereas (7 + 11 is not due 
to absence of right parenthesis. If any syntax error is 
present, the interpreter shows error message(s) and 
stops the execution there. Such errors need to be 
removed before execution of the program.
3.9.2	Logical Errors 
A logical error/bug (called semantic error) does not stop 
execution but the program behaves incorrectly and 
produces undesired /wrong output. Since the program 
interprets successfully even when logical errors are 
present in it, it is sometimes difficult to identify these 
errors. 

For example, if we wish to find the average of two 
numbers 10 and 12 and we write the code as 10 + 12/2, 
it would run successfully and produce the result 16, 
which is wrong. The correct code to find the average 
should have been (10 + 12) /2 to get the output as 11.
3.9.3	Runtime Error
A runtime error causes abnormal termination of 
program while it is executing. Runtime error is when the 
statement is correct syntactically, but the interpreter 
can not execute it. 

For example, we have a statement having division 
operation in the program. By mistake, if the denominator 
value is zero then it will give a runtime error like “division 
by zero”. 

The process of identifying and removing logical 
errors and runtime errors is called debugging. We need 
to debug a program so that is can run successfully and 
generate the desired output.

3.10 Functions

A function refers to a set of statements or instructions 
grouped under a name that perform specified tasks. 
For repeated or routine tasks, we  define a function. A 
function is defined once and can be reused at multiple 

Reprint 2025-26

Brief Overview of Python 45

places in a program by simply writing the function Notes
name, i.e., by calling that function. 

Suppose we have a program which requires to 
calculate compound interest at multiple places. Now 
instead of writing the formula to calculate the interest 
every time, we can create a function called CalcCompInt 
and inside that function we write the code to take 
inputs (like interest rate, duration, principle), calculate 
interest, and display output. We can simply call the 
function by writing the function name CalcCompInt 
whenever compound interest is to be computed and 
thus reuse the code to save time and efforts. 

Python has many predefined functions called built‑in 
functions. We have already used two built-in functions 
print() and input(). A module is a python file in 
which multiple functions are grouped together. These 
functions can be easily used in a Python program by 
importing the module using import command. Use 
of built‑in functions makes programming faster and 
efficient. To use a built‑in function we must know the 
following about that function:
•	 Function Name — name of the function. 
•	 Arguments — While calling a function, we may pass 

value(s), called argument, enclosed in parenthesis, 
to the function. The function works based on these 
values. A function may or may not have argument(s).

•	 Return Value − A function may or may not return one 
or more values. A function performs operations on the 
basis of argument (s) passed to it and the result is 
passed back to the calling point. Some functions do 
not return any value. 
Let us consider the following Python program using 

three built-in functions input(), int() and print():
#Calculate square of a number
num = int(input("Enter the first number"))
square = num * num
print("the square of", num, " is ", square)  

Observe:
•	 Two built‑in functions are used in the first statement, 

int() and input(). The third line has a function 
print(). 

•	 The input function accepts an argument, “Enter your 
name”. Argument(s) is the value(s) passed within 
the parenthesis.

46 Informatics Practices – Class XI

Notes •	 Similarly the print function has four arguments "the 
square of", num, "is", square separated by 
commas.

•	 The int function in the first line takes as argument 
the value entered by the user from the keyboard and 
converts it into a string and returns it. Thus the 
return value from the int() function is an integer. 
Some of the most commonly used built‑in 

functions in Python are listed in Table 3.8 under four 
broad categories.

3.11 if..else Statements

Usually statements in a program are executed one after 
another. However, there are situations when we have 
more than one option to choose from, based on the 
outcome of certain conditions. This can be done using if..
else conditional statements. Conditional statements let 
us write program to do different tasks or take different 
paths  based on the outcome of the conditions. 

There are three ways to write if..else statements:
•	 if statement — executes the statement(s) inside if 

when the condition is true. ‘
Example 3.11	  

age = int(input("Enter your age "))

if age >= 18: # use ‘:’ to indicate end of 
condition.
    print("Eligible to vote")

conditions and execute statements accordingly. indentation.

Meaning of elif is elseif. We can also write elseif 
instead of elif for more clarity.

Example 3.12	 Check whether a number is positive, 
negative, or zero.

number = int(input("Enter a number: ")
if number > 0:
     print("Number is positive")
elif number < 0:
     print("Number is negative")
else:
     print("Number is zero")

When the conditional statements appear, the 
Python interpreter executes code inside one block that 
is selected based on the condition. Number of elif is 
dependent on the number of conditions to be checked. 
If the first condition is false, then the next condition 
is checked, and so on. If one of the conditions is true, 
then the corresponding indented block executes, and 
the if statement terminates. After that, the statements 
outside the if..else are executed or the program 
terminates if there are no further statements.

3.12 For Loop

Sometimes we need to repeat certain things for a 
particular number of times. For example, a program has 
to display attendance for every student of a class. Here 
the program has to execute the print statement for 
every student. In programming, this kind of repetition 
is called looping or iteration, and it is done using for 
statement. The for statement is used to iterate over 
a range of values or a sequence. The loop is executed 
for each item in the range. The values can be numeric, 
string, list, or tuple.

When all the items in the range are exhausted, the 
statements within loop are not executed and Python 
interpreter starts executing the statements immediately 
following the for loop. While using for loop, we should 
know in advance the number of times the loop will 
execute.

	 Syntax of the for Loop:
for <control-variable> in <sequence/items in 
range>:

	   <statements inside body of the 			 
 	   loop>

Program 3-4	 Program to 
print even 
numbers in a

for num in numbers:
     if (num % 2) == 0:
          print(num,'is an even Number')

Output:
2  is an even Number
4  is an even Number
6  is an even Number
8  is an even Number
10 is an even Number

Note: Body of the loop is indented with respect to the for statement.

3.12.1	The range() Function
The range() is a built-in function in Python. Syntax of 
range() function is:
		  range([start], stop[, step])

It is used to create a list containing a sequence of 
integers from the given start value upto stop value 
(excluding stop value), with a difference of the given 
step value. If start value is not specified, by default 
the list starts from 0. If step is also not specified, by 
default the value is incremented by 1 in each iteration. 
All parameters of range() function must be integers. The 
step parameter can be a positive or a negative integer 
excluding zero.

Example 3.13	
>>> list(range(10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

#start value is given as 2
>>>  list(range(2, 10))  
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]       

#step value is 5 and start value is 0
>>>  list(range(0, 30, 5)) 	
[0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]  	    

#step value is -1. Hence, decreasing 	
#sequence is generated
>>>  list(range(0, -9, -1)) 	
[0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8]  

The function range() is often used in for loops for 
generating a sequence of numbers.
Program 3-5	 Program to print the multiples of 10 for 

numbers in a given range.
#Program 3-5

4.1	 Introduction to List Dictionaries
The data type list is an ordered sequence which is 
mutable and made up of one or more elements. Unlike a 
string which consists of only characters, a list can have 
elements of different data types such as integer, float, 
string, tuple or even another list. A list is very useful to 
group elements of mixed data types. Elements of a list 
are enclosed in square brackets and are separated by 
comma. 
Example 4.1	  

#list1 is the list of six even numbers
>>> list1 = [2,4,6,8,10,12]
>>> print(list1)
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]

#list3 is the list of mixed data types
>>> list3 = [100,23.5,'Hello']
>>> print(list3)

            ['Mathematics',303]] 
>>> print(list4)
[['Physics', 101], ['Chemistry', 202],
 ['Mathematics', 303]]

4.1.1	Accessing Elements in a List
Each element in list is accessed using value called index. 
The fist index value is 0, the second index is 1 and so 
on. Elements in the list are assigned index values in 
increasing order sterling from 0. 

	 To access an element, use square brackets with 
the index [] value of that element. We may also use 
negative index value to access elements starting from 
the last element in the list, having index value -0.

#initialing a list named list1 
>>> list1 = [2,4,6,8,10,12]   	
>>> list1[0]	#returns first element of list1

4.1.2	Lists are Mutable
In Python, lists are mutable. It means that the contents 
of the list can be changed after it has been created. 

#List list1 of colors 
	 >>> list1 = ['Red','Green','Blue','Orange'] 
#change/override the fourth element of list1 
	 >>> list1[3] = 'Black'               
	 >>> list1  #print the modified list list1
['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Black']

4.2	 List Operations

The data type list allows manipulation of its contents 
through various operations as shown below.
4.2.1	Concatenation
Python allows us to join two or more lists using Concatenation is the 
concatenation operator using symbol +. merging of two or 

more values. Example: 
#list1 is list of first five odd integers we can concatenate 
>>> list1 = [1,3,5,7,9]		 strings together.  
#list2 is list of first five even integers 
>>> list2 = [2,4,6,8,10]		
#Get elements of list1 followed by list2 
>>> list1 + list2           	
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
>>> list3 = ['Red','Green','Blue']
>>> list4 = ['Cyan', 'Magenta', 'Yellow' 
,'Black']
>>> list3 + list4
['Red','Green','Blue','Cyan','Magenta',   		
 'Yellow','Black']

Note that, there is no change in original lists i.e., 
list1, list2, list3, list4 remain the same after 
concatenation operation. If we want to use the result of 
two concatenated lists, we should use an assignment 
operator. 
For example, 

#Join list 2 at the end of list 
>>> new List = list 1 + list 2
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

>> new list The concatenation operator '+’ requires that 
the operands should be of list type only. If we try to 
concatenate a list with elements of some other data 
type, TypeError occurs.

>>> str1 = "abc"
>>> list1 + str1
TypeError: can only concatenate list (not 
"str") to list

4.2.2	Repetition
Python allows us to replicate the contents of a list using 
repetition operator depicted by symbol *.

>>> list1 = ['Hello']
#elements of list1 repeated 4 times
>>> list1 * 4			 
['Hello', 'Hello', 'Hello', 'Hello']

4.2.3	Membership
The membership operator in checks if the element 
is present in the list and returns True, else returns 
False. 

>>> list1 = ['Red','Green','Blue']
>>> 'Green' in list1
True
>>> 'Cyan' in list1
False

The Operator not in transpose returns True if the 
element is not present in the list, else it returns False.

>>> list1 = ['Red','Green','Blue']
>>> 'Cyan' not in list1
True
>>> 'Green' not in list1
False

4.2.4	Slicing
Slicing operations allow us to create new list by taking 
out elements from an existing list. 

>>> list1 =['Red','Green','Blue','Cyan', 
'Magenta','Yellow','Black']
#subject from indexes 2 to 5 of list 1
>>> list1[2:6]
['Blue', 'Cyan', 'Magenta', 'Yellow'] 

 #list1 is truncated to the end of the list
>>> list1[2:20] #second index is out of range  
['Blue', 'Cyan', 'Magenta', 'Yellow', 
'Black']
	
>>> list1[7:2] 	 #first index > second index
[] 			   #results in an empty list

4.3	T raversing a List

We can access each element of the list or traverse a list 
using a for loop or a while loop.
(A)	 List traversal using for loop: 

>>> list1 = ['Red','Green','Blue','Yellow',  
		     	 'Black']
>>> for item in list1:
         print(item)

 Output: len (list1) returns 
the length or total 

Red number of elements of 
Green list1.
Blue range(n) returns a 

sequence of numbers 
Yellow starting from 0, 
Black increases by 1 and ends 

Another way of accessing the elements of the list is at n-1 (one number 
using range() and len() functions: less than the specified 

number i.e. is)
>>> for i in range(len(list1)):
         print(list1[i])

Output:
Red
Green
Blue
Yellow
Black

4.4	 List Methods and Built-in Functions

The data type list has several built-in methods that 
are useful in programming. Some of them are listed in 
Table 4.1.

Table 4.1 Built-in functions for list manipulation
Method Description Example
len() Returns the length of the list passed as >>> list1 = [10,20,30,40,50]

the argument >>> len(list1)
5

list() Creates an empty list if no argument is >>> list1 = list()
passed >>> list1

[ ]

>>> str1= 'aeiou'
Creates a list if a sequence is passed as >>> list1 = list(str1)
an argument >>> list1

['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

append() Appends a single element passed as an >>> list1 = [10,20,30,40]
argument at the end of the list >>> list1.append(50)

>>> list1
A list can also be appended as an ele- [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
ment to an existing list >>> list1 = [10,20,30,40]

>>> list1.append([50,60])
>>> list1
[10, 20, 30, 40, [50, 60]]

extend() Appends each element of the list passed >>> list1 = [10,20,30]
as argument at the end of the given list >>> list2 = [40,50]

>>> list1.extend(list2)
>>> list1
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

insert() Inserts an element at a particular index >>> list1 = [10,20,30,40,50]
in the list #inserts element 25 at index value 2

>>> list1.insert(2,25)
>>> list1
[10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50]
>>> list1.insert(0,100)
>>> list1
[100, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50]

4.5	 List Manipulation    
In this chapter, we have learnt to create a list and the different ways to 
manipulate lists. In the following programs, we will apply the various list 
manipulation methods.

Program 4-1	 Write a program to allow user to perform any those list operation 
given in a menu. The menu is:

1. 	Append an element
2. 	Insert an element
3. 	Append a list to the given list
4. 	Modify an existing element
5. 	Delete an existing element from its position
6. 	Delete an existing element with a given value
7. 	Sort the list in the ascending order
8. 	Sort the list in descending order 
9. 	Display the list.

#Program 4-1
#Menu driven program to do various list operations
myList = [22,4,16,38,13] #myList having 5 elements
choice = 0
For attempt in range (3): print ("Attempt number:", attempt)
print("The list 'myList' has the following elements", myList)
print("\nL I S T   O P E R A T I O N S")
print(" 1. Append an element")
print(" 2. Insert an element at the desired position")
print(" 3. Append a list to the given list")
print(" 4. Modify an existing element")
print(" 5. Delete an existing element by its position")

4.6	 Introduction to Dictionaries    

The data type dictionary falls under mapping. It is a 
mapping between a set of keys and a set of values. 
The key-value pair is called an item. A key is separated 
from its value by a colon(:) and consecutive items are 
separated by commas. Items in dictionaries are ordered, 
so we will get back the data in the same order in which 
we had entered  the data initially in the dictionary.
4.6.1	Creating a Dictionary
To create a dictionary, the items entered are separated 
by commas and enclosed in curly braces. Each item is 
a key value pair, separated through colon (:). The keys 
in the dictionary must be unique and should be of any 
immutable data type i.e. number, string or tuple. The 
values can be repeated and can be of any data type.  
Example 4.2	

#dict1 is an empty dictionary
>>> dict1 = {}           
>>> dict1
{}
#dict3 is the dictionary that maps names of  
#the students to marks in percentage
>>> dict3 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}
>>> dict3
{'Mohan': 95, 'Ram': 89, 'Suhel': 92, 
'Sangeeta': 85}

4.6.2	Accessing Items in a Dictionary
We have already seen that the items of a sequence 
(string, list and tuple) are accessed using a technique 
called indexing. The items of a dictionary are accessed 
via the keys rather than via their relative positions 
or indices. Each key serves as the index and maps to 
a value.

68 Informatics Practices – Class XI

Notes The following example shows how a dictionary 
returns the value corresponding to the given key:

>>> dict3 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}
>>> dict3['Ram']          
89
>>> dict3['Sangeeta']
85
#using unspecified key
>>> dict3['Shyam']        
KeyError: 'Shyam'

In the above examples the key 'Ram' always maps to the 
value 89 and key 'Sangeeta' always maps to the value 
85. So the order of items does not matter. If the key is not 
present in the dictionary we get KeyError.

4.6.3	Membership Operation
The membership operator in checks if the key is present 
in the dictionary and returns True, else it returns False. 

>>> dict1 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}
>>> 'Suhel' in dict1
True

The not in operator returns True if the key is not 
present in the dictionary, else it returns False.

>>> dict1 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}
>>> 'Suhel' not in dict1
False

4.6.4	Dictionaries are Mutable
Dictionaries are mutable which implies that the 
contents of the dictionary can be changed after it has 
been created. 
(A)	 Adding a new item
We can add a new item to the dictionary as shown in 
the following example:

>>> dict1 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}
>>> dict1['Meena'] = 78
>>> dict1
{'Mohan': 95, 'Ram': 89, 'Suhel': 92, 
'Sangeeta': 85, 'Meena': 78}

(B)	 Modifying an existing item
The existing dictionary can be modified by just 
overwriting the key-value pair. Example to modify a 
given item in the dictionary:

>>> dict1 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}
#Marks of Suhel changed to 93.5
>>> dict1['Suhel'] = 93.5    
>>> dict1
{'Mohan': 95, 'Ram': 89, 'Suhel': 93.5, 
'Sangeeta': 85}

4.7	T raversing a Dictionary

We can access each item of the dictionary or traverse a 
dictionary using for loop. 

>>> dict1 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}

Method 1:
>>> for key in dict1:
         print(key,':',dict1[key])
Mohan: 95
Ram: 89
Suhel: 92
Sangeeta: 85

Method 2:
>>> for key,value in dict1.items():
         print(key,':',value)
Mohan: 95
Ram: 89
Suhel: 92
Sangeeta: 85

methods.

4.9	 Manipulating Dictionaries

In this chapter, we have learnt how to create a 
dictionary and apply various methods to manipulate it. 
The following examples show the application of those 
manipulation methods on dictionaries.

(a)	Create a dictionary ‘ODD’ of odd numbers between 
1 and 10, where the key is the decimal number and 
the value is the corresponding number in words. 
>>> ODD = {1:'One',3:'Three',5:'Five',7:'Seven',9:'Nine'}
>>> ODD
{1: 'One', 3: 'Three', 5: 'Five', 7: 'Seven', 9: 'Nine'}

(b)	Display the keys in dictionary ‘ODD’.
>>> ODD.keys()
dict_keys([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])

(c)	Display the values in dictionary ‘ODD’.
>>> ODD.values()
dict_values(['One', 'Three', 'Five', 'Seven', 'Nine'])

(d)	Display the items from dictionary ‘ODD’
>>> ODD.items()
dict_items([(1, 'One'), (3, 'Three'), (5, 'Five'), (7, 'Seven'), (9, 
'Nine')])

(e)	Find the length of the dictionary ‘ODD’.
>>> len(ODD)
5

(f)	 Check if 7 is present or not in dictionary ‘ODD’
>>> 7 in ODD
True

Summary
•	 Lists are mutable sequences in Python, i.e. we can 

change the elements of the list.
•	 Elements of a list are put in square brackets 

separated by comma.
•	 List indexing is same as that of list and starts at 0. 

Two way indexing allows traversing the list in the 
forward as well as in the backward direction.

•	 Operator + concatenates one list to the end of other 
list.

•	 Operator * repeats the content of a list by  
specified number of times.

•	 Membership operator in tells if an element is 
present in the list or not and not in does the 
opposite.

•	 Slicing is used to extract a part of the list.
•	 There are many list manipulation methods. Few 

are: len(), list(), append(), extend(), insert(), count(), 
find(), remove(), pop(), reverse(), sort(), sorted(), 
min(), max(), sum().

•	 Dictionary is a mapping (non scalar) data type. It 
is an unordered collection of key-value pair; key-
value pair are put inside curly braces.

•	 Each key is separated from its value by a colon.
•	 Keys are unique and act as the index.
•	 Keys are of immutable type but values can be 

mutable.

banking allows customers of a bank to conduct a range 
of financial transactions through the bank’s website 
anytime, anywhere. As part of initial investigation you 
are suggested to:

•	 Collect a Bank’s application form. After careful 
analysis of the form,  identify the information 
required for opening a savings account. Also 
enquire about the rate of interest offered for a 
savings account. 

•	 The basic two operations performed on an account 
are Deposit and Withdrawal. Write a menu driven 
program that accepts either of the two choices 
of Deposit and Withdrawal, then accepts an 
amount, performs the transaction and  accordingly 
displays the balance. Remember every bank has 
a requirement of minimum balance which needs 
to be taken care of during withdrawal operations.

5.1	 Introduction to Data

Many a time, people take decisions based on 
certain data or information. For example, while 
choosing a college for getting admission, one 
looks at placement data of previous years of that 
college, educational qualification and experience 
of the faculty members, laboratory and hostel 
facilities, fees, etc. So we can say that identification 
of a college is based on various data and their 
analysis. Governments systematically collect 
and record data about the population through 
a process called census. Census data contains

valuable information which are helpful is planning and 
formulating policies. Likewise, the coaching staff of a 
sports team analyses previous performances of opponent 
teams for making strategies. Banks maintain data about 
the customers, their account details and transactions. 
All these examples highlight the need of data in various 
fields. Data are indeed crucial for decision making. 

In the previous examples, one cannot make decisions 
by looking at the data itself. In our example of choosing 
a college, suppose the placement cell of the college has 
maintained data of about 2000 students placed with 
different companies at different salary packages in the 
last 3 years. Looking at such data, one cannot make 
any remark about the placement of students of that 
college. The college processes and analyses this data 
and the results are given in the placement brochure of 
the college through summarisation as well as visuals for 
easy understanding. Hence, data need to be gathered, 
processed and analysed for making decisions. 

A knowledge base is 
a store of information In general, data is a collection of characters, numbers, 

consisting of facts, and other symbols that represents values of some 
assumptions and situations or variables. Data is plural and singular of the 
rules which an AI word data is “datum”. Using computers, data are stored 
system can use for in electronic forms because data processing becomes 
decision making. faster and easier as compared to manual data processing 

done by people. The Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) revolution led by computer, mobile and 
Internet has resulted in generation of large volume of 
data and at a very fast pace. The following list contains 
some examples of data that we often come across.
•	 Name, age, gender, contact details, etc., of a person
•	 Transactions data generated through banking, 

ticketing, shopping, etc. whether online or offline
•	 Images, graphics, animations, audio, video
•	 Documents and web pages
•	 Online posts, comments and messages 
•	 Signals generated by sensors
•	 Satellite data including meteorological data, 

communication data, earth observation data, etc.

In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial
substance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical
and chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical
change occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.
You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a
chemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction
has taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to
these questions.

CHEMICAL
Activity 1.1 can be described as – when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in
oxygen, it gets converted to magnesium oxide. This description of a
chemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a
shorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a
word-equation.
The word-equation for the above reaction would be –
Magnesium + Oxygen
(Reactants)

→ Magnesium oxide

(1.1)

(Product)

The substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),
magnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is
magnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.
A word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an
arrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand
side (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are
written on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.
The arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of
the reaction.

1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation
Is there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?
Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use
chemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a
chemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and
magnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –
Mg + O2 → MgO

(1.2)

Count and compare the number of atoms of each element on the
LHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the
same on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,
then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on
both sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal
chemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical
equation for the burning of magnesium in air.

1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations
Recall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass
can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the
total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction
has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.
In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the
same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a
skeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us
learn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.
The word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as –
Zinc + Sulphuric acid → Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen
The above word-equation may be represented by the following
chemical equation –
Zn + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2

(1.3)

Let us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both
sides of the arrow.

reactants (LHS)

As the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of
the arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.
Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –
Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2

(1.4)

Chemical Reactions and Equations

Reprint 2025-26

Step I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each
formula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the
equation.
Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2

(1.5)

Step II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the
unbalanced equation (1.5).

Step III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound
that contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a
product. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum
number of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element
oxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on
the LHS.
To balance the oxygen atoms –
Atoms of
oxygen

In reactants

In products

(i) Initial
(ii) To balance

1 (in H2O)

4 (in Fe3O4)

To equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we
cannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the
reactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient
‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation
becomes –
(1.6)
Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2
(partly balanced equation)
Step IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements
to proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced
equation.
To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules
of hydrogen as four on the RHS.

Step V: Examine the above equation and pick up the third element
which is not balanced. You find that only one element is left to be
balanced, that is, iron.

To equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS.
3 Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + 4 H2

(1.8)

Step VI: Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we
count atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.
(1.9)

3Fe + 4H2O → Fe3O4 + 4H2

(balanced equation)

The numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are
equal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical
equations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance
the equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.
Step VII: Writing Symbols of Physical States Carefully examine
the above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about
the physical state of each reactant and product? No information has
been given in this equation about their physical states.
To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states
of the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical
formulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants
and products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),
respectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product
is present as a solution in water.
The balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes
3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)

(1.10)

Note that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this
reaction water is used in the form of steam.
Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless
it is necessary to specify them.
Sometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,
catalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow
in the equation. For example –
340 atm

(1.11)

CO(g) + 2H2 (g) 

Chlorophyll → C6 H12O 6 (aq) + 6O2 (aq) + 6H2 O(l) (1.12)

We have learnt in Class IX that during a chemical reaction atoms of one
element do not change into those of another element. Nor do atoms
disappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical
reactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to
produce new substances. You will study about types of bonds formed
between atoms in Chapters 3 and 4.

is formed from two or more reactants is known as a combination reaction.

Do You Know?

A solution of slaked lime produced by the reaction 1.13 is used for whitewashing
walls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin
layer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is formed after two to
three days of whitewashing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note
that the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO3.

(ii)

(1.15)

Formation of water from H2(g) and O2(g)
2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l)

(1.16)

In simple language we can say that when two or more substances
(elements or compounds) combine to form a single product, the reactions
are called combination reactions.
In Activity 1.4, we also observed that a large amount of heat is evolved.
This makes the reaction mixture warm. Reactions in which heat is
released along with the formation of products are called exothermic
chemical reactions.
Other examples of exothermic reactions are –
(i) Burning of natural gas
CH4(g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g)
(ii)

(1.17)

Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process?

We all know that we need energy to stay alive. We get this energy
from the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler
substances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain
carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose.
This glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides
energy. The special name of this reaction is respiration, the process of
which you will study in Chapter 6.
C6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(aq) → 6CO2(aq) + 6H2O(l) + energy

(iii)

The decomposition of vegetable matter into compost is also an
example of an exothermic reaction.
Identify the type of the reaction taking place in Activity 1.1, where
heat is given out along with the formation of a single product.

(Ferric oxide)

In this reaction you can observe that a single reactant breaks down
to give simpler products. This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous
sulphate crystals (FeSO4. 7H2O) lose water when heated and the colour
of the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide (Fe2O3),
sulphur dioxide (SO2) and sulphur trioxide (SO3). Ferric oxide is a solid,
while SO2 and SO3 are gases.
Decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon
dioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in
various industries. Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has
many uses – one is in the manufacture of cement. When a decomposition
reaction is carried out by heating, it is called thermal decomposition.

What causes this? The white precipitate of BaSO4 is formed by the
2+
reaction of SO2–
4 and Ba . The other product formed is sodium chloride
which remains in the solution. Such reactions in which there is an
exchange of ions between the reactants are called double displacement
reactions.

Figure 1.10
Oxidation of copper to
copper oxide

Heat a china dish containing about 1 g
copper powder (Fig. 1.10).
What do you observe?

The surface of copper powder becomes coated with
black copper(II) oxide. Why has this black
substance formed?
This is because oxygen is added to copper and
copper oxide is formed.
Heat
(1.28)
2Cu + O2 
→ 2CuO
If hydrogen gas is passed over this heated material (CuO), the black
coating on the surface turns brown as the reverse reaction takes place
and copper is obtained.

(1.29)

CuO +H 2 Heat
→ Cu + H2 O
If a substance gains oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be oxidised.
If a substance loses oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be reduced.
During this reaction (1.29), the copper(II) oxide is losing oxygen and
is being reduced. The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised.
In other words, one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced
during a reaction. Such reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions
or redox reactions.

(1.30)
Some other examples of redox reactions are:

ZnO + C → Zn + CO

(1.31)

MnO2 + 4HCl → MnCl 2 + 2H2 O + Cl2

(1.32)

Science

Reprint 2025-26

In reaction (1.31) carbon is oxidised to CO and ZnO is reduced to Zn.
In reaction (1.32) HCl is oxidised to Cl2 whereas MnO2 is reduced to MnCl2.
From the above examples we can say that if a substance gains oxygen
or loses hydrogen during a reaction, it is oxidised. If a substance loses
oxygen or gains hydrogen during a reaction, it is reduced.
Recall Activity 1.1

1.3.1 Corrosion
You must have observed that iron articles are shiny when new, but get
coated with a reddish brown powder when left for some time. This process
is commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get
tarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating
formed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances
around it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this
process is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green
coating on copper are other examples of corrosion.
Corrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships
and to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of
iron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is
spent to replace damaged iron. You will learn more about corrosion in
Chapter 3.

1.3.2 Rancidity
Have you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left
for a long time?
When fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell
and taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation
(antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food
in air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that
chips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as
nitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?

A complete chemical equation represents the reactants, products and their physical
states symbolically.
A chemical equation is balanced so that the numbers of atoms of each type involved
in a chemical reaction are the same on the reactant and product sides of the
equation. Equations must always be balanced.
In a combination reaction two or more substances combine to form a new single
substance.
Decomposition reactions are opposite to combination reactions. In a decomposition
reaction, a single substance decomposes to give two or more substances.
Reactions in which heat is given out along with the products are called exothermic
reactions.
Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions.
When an element displaces another element from its compound, a displacement
reaction occurs.
Two different atoms or groups of atoms (ions) are exchanged in double displacement
reactions.
Precipitation reactions produce insoluble salts.
Reactions also involve the gain or loss of oxygen or hydrogen by substances.
Oxidation is the gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen. Reduction is the loss of oxygen
or gain of hydrogen.

Acids, Bases

Y

ou have learnt in your previous classes that the sour and bitter
tastes of food are due to acids and bases, respectively, present in them.
If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after
overeating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon
juice, vinegar or baking soda solution?
n

n

Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy?
Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of
acids and bases to nullify each other’s effect.
Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting
them.

Do You Know?

You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour
of blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of
the red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another
such indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth
becomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed
on it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of
water. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and
phenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.
In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how
acids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting
things that we use and see in our day-to-day life.

Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to
the division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus
solution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural
materials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as
Hydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a
solution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.

from the acids as hydrogen gas and forms a compound called a salt.
Thus, the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as –

You will notice that the colour of the solution becomes blue-green

due to the formation of copper(II) chloride in the reaction. The general
reaction between a metal oxide and an acid can be written as –
Metal oxide + Acid → Salt + Water

metallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water, similar to the
reaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides.

2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with Base
You saw the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide
(lime water) in Activity 2.5. Calcium hydroxide, which is a base, reacts
with carbon dioxide to produce a salt and water. Since this is similar to
the reaction between a base and an acid, we can conclude that nonmetallic oxides are acidic in nature.

The bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in Fig. 2.3.
But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct
electricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric
current through the solution. The electric current is carried through the
acidic solution by ions.
Acids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, NO3– in
HNO3, SO2–
in H2SO4, CH3COO– in CH3COOH. Since the cation present in
4

acids is H , this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in
solution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.

hydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity?

Figure 2.4 Preparation of HCl gas

Note to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced
through a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.

This experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced
in the presence of water. The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules
cannot occur in the absence of water.
HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–
Hydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining
with water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as
H+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+).
H+ + H2O → H3O+
We have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water. Let us see
what happens when a base is dissolved in water.

Bases generate hydroxide (OH–) ions in water. Bases which are soluble
in water are called alkalis.

All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They
are soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may
cause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?

Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all
–
bases generate OH (aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as
follows –
Acid + Base → Salt + Water
H X + M OH → MX + HOH
–

H+(aq) + OH (aq) → H2O(l)
Let us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.

Take 10 mL water in a beaker.
Add a few drops of concentrated H2SO4 to it and swirl the
beaker slowly.
Touch the base of the beaker.
Is there a change in temperature?
Is this an exothermic or endothermic process?
Repeat the above Activity with sodium hydroxide pellets
and record your observations.

The process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly
exothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric
acid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly
to water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,
the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.
The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look
out for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated
sulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.
Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the
concentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is
called dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?
We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between
an acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about
dilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions.
Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?
Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is?
We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a
mixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different
colours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.
A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called
pH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,
meaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from
0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a
number which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher
the hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.
The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale
represent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it
represents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,
increase in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated
with the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.

Figure 2.7 pH of some common substances shown on a pH paper (colours are only a rough guide)

The strength of acids and bases depends on the number of H+ ions
and OH– ions produced, respectively. If we take hydrochloric acid and
acetic acid of the same concentration, say one molar, then these produce
different amounts of hydrogen ions. Acids that give rise to more H+ ions
are said to be strong acids, and acids that give less H+ ions are said to be
weak acids. Can you now say what weak and strong bases are?

Are plants and animals pH sensitive?
Our body works within the pH range of 7.0 to 7.8. Living organisms can
survive only in a narrow range of pH change. When pH of rain water is
less than 5.6, it is called acid rain. When acid rain flows into the rivers, it
lowers the pH of the river water. The survival of aquatic life in such rivers
becomes difficult.

pH in our digestive system
It is very interesting to note that our stomach produces hydrochloric
acid. It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.
During indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes
pain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called
antacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the
beginning of this Chapter. These antacids neutralise the excess acid.
Magnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for
this purpose.
pH change as the cause of tooth decay
Tooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth
enamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium
phosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in
water, but is corroded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria
present in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food
particles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent
this is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are
generally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and
prevent tooth decay.
Self defence by animals and plants through chemical warfare
Have you ever been stung by a honey-bee? Bee-sting leaves an acid
which causes pain and irritation. Use of a mild base like baking soda
on the stung area gives relief. Stinging hair of nettle leaves inject
methanoic acid causing burning pain.

By now you have learnt that the salt formed
by the combination of hydrochloric acid and
sodium hydroxide solution is called sodium
chloride. This is the salt that you use in food.
You must have observed in the above Activity
that it is a neutral salt.
Seawater contains many salts dissolved
in it. Sodium chloride is separated from these
salts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in
several parts of the world. These large crystals
are often brown due to impurities. This is
called rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed
when seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt
is mined like coal.

Common salt — A raw material for chemicals
The common salt thus obtained is an important raw material for various
materials of daily use, such as sodium hydroxide, baking soda, washing
soda, bleaching powder and many more. Let us see how one substance
is used for making all these different substances.
Sodium hydroxide
When electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium
chloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The
process is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed–
chlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.
2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) ® 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)
Chlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.
Sodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three
products produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the
different uses of these products.

Figure 2.8 Important products from the chlor-alkali process

Bleaching powder
You have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the
electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used
for the manufacture of bleaching powder. Bleaching powder is produced
by the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. Bleaching powder
is represented as Ca(ClO)2, though the actual composition is quite
complex.
2Ca(OH)2 + 2Cl2 ® Ca(ClO)2 + CaCl2 + 2H2O

Science

30

Reprint 2025-26

Bleaching powder is used –
(i) for bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching
wood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes
in laundry;
(ii) as an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and
(iii) to make drinking water free from germs.
Baking soda
The baking soda is commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy
pakoras, etc. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical
name of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO3). It is
produced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.
NaCl + H2 O + CO2 + NH3 → NH4 Cl + NaHCO3
(Ammonium (Sodium
chloride)
hydrogencarbonate)

Did you check the pH of sodium hydrogencarbonate in Activity 2.14?
Can you correlate why it can be used to neutralise an acid? It is a mild
non-corrosive basic salt. The following reaction takes place when it is
heated during cooking –
Heat
2NaHCO3 
→ Na 2 CO3 + H2O + CO2

(Sodium
hydrogencarbonate)

(Sodium
carbonate)

Sodium hydrogencarbonate has got various uses in the household.
Uses of Baking soda
(i) For making baking powder, which is a mixture of baking soda
(sodium hydrogencarbonate) and a mild edible acid such as
tartaric acid. When baking powder is heated or mixed in water,
the following reaction takes place –
NaHCO3 + H+

→

CO2 + H2O + Sodium salt of acid

(From any acid)

Carbon dioxide produced during the reaction can cause bread or
cake to rise making them soft and spongy.
(ii) Sodium hydrogencarbonate is also an ingredient in antacids.
Being alkaline, it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and
provides relief.
(iii) It is also used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.
Washing soda
Another chemical that can be obtained from sodium chloride is
Na2CO3.10H2O (washing soda). You have seen above that sodium
carbonate can be obtained by heating baking soda; recrystallisation of
sodium carbonate gives washing soda. It is also a basic salt.
Na2 CO3 + 10 H2 O → Na 2 CO3 .10 H2O
( Sodium
carbonate )

chemicals for many industrial processes as well.
Uses of washing soda
(i) Sodium carbonate (washing soda) is used in glass, soap and
paper industries.
(ii) It is used in the manufacture of sodium compounds such as borax.
(iii) Sodium carbonate can be used as a cleaning agent for domestic

Do you notice water droplets in the
boiling tube? Where have these come
from?
Add 2-3 drops of water on the sample
of copper sulphate obtained after
heating.
What do you observe? Is the blue
colour of copper sulphate restored?

Copper sulphate crystals which seem to be dry contain water of
crystallisation. When we heat the crystals, this water is removed and the
salt turns white.
If you moisten the crystals again with water, you will find that blue
colour of the crystals reappears.
Water of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present
in one formula unit of a salt. Five water molecules are present in one
formula unit of copper sulphate. Chemical formula for hydrated copper
sulphate is Cu SO4. 5H2O. Now you would be able to answer the question
whether the molecule of Na2CO3.10H2O is wet.
One other salt, which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum.
It has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the chemical
formula CaSO4.2H2O. Let us look into the use of this salt.

Acid-base indicators are dyes or mixtures of dyes which are used to indicate the
presence of acids and bases.
Acidic nature of a substance is due to the formation of H+(aq) ions in solution.
Formation of OH–(aq) ions in solution is responsible for the basic nature of a
substance.
When an acid reacts with a metal, hydrogen gas is evolved and a corresponding
salt is formed.
When a base reacts with a metal, along with the evolution of hydrogen gas a salt is
formed which has a negative ion composed of the metal and oxygen.
When an acid reacts with a metal carbonate or metal hydrogencarbonate, it gives
the corresponding salt, carbon dioxide gas and water.
Acidic and basic solutions in water conduct electricity because they produce
hydrogen and hydroxide ions respectively.

3.1.2 Non-metals
In the previous Class you have learnt that there are very few non-metals
as compared to metals. Some of the examples of non-metals are carbon,
sulphur, iodine, oxygen, hydrogen, etc. The non-metals are either solids
or gases except bromine which is a liquid.

(iii) Carbon is a non-metal that can exist in different forms. Each
form is called an allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is
the hardest natural substance known and has a very high melting
and boiling point. Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a
conductor of electricity.

Almost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides.
Metal + Oxygen → Metal oxide
For example, when copper is heated in air, it combines with oxygen
to form copper(II) oxide, a black oxide.
2Cu + O2 → 2CuO
(Copper)

(Copper(II) oxide)

Similarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide.
4Al

+ 3O2 → 2Al2O3

(Aluminium)

(Aluminium oxide)

Recall from Chapter 2, how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid.
We have learnt that metal oxides are basic in nature. But some metal
oxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide show both acidic as well as
basic behaviour. Such metal oxides which react with both acids as well as
bases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides.
Aluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases –
Al2O3 + 6HCl
→ 2AlCl3
+ 3H2O
Al2O3 + 2NaOH → 2NaAlO2 + H2O
(Sodium
aluminate)

Most metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve
in water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in
water to produce alkalis as follows –
Na2O(s) + H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq)
K2O(s)

+ H2O(l) → 2KOH(aq)

Do You Know?

We have observed in Activity 3.9 that all metals do not react with
oxygen at the same rate. Different metals show different reactivities
towards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so
vigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them
and to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.
At ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,
aluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The
protective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron
does not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled
in the flame of the burner. Copper does not burn, but the hot metal is
coated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do
not react with oxygen even at high temperatures.

Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium
develops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air. This aluminium oxide coat makes it
resistant to further corrosion. The resistance can be improved further by making the
oxide layer thicker. During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode
and is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode
reacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer. This oxide layer can
be dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.
After performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium
is the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of
magnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium.
But burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of
zinc, iron, copper or lead. Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a
conclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals.

Metals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen
gas. Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form
metal hydroxide. But all metals do not react with water.
Metal
+ Water → Metal oxide + Hydrogen
Metal oxide + Water → Metal hydroxide
Metals like potassium and sodium react violently with cold water. In
case of sodium and potassium, the reaction is so violent and exothermic
that the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire.
2K(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2KOH(aq) + H2(g) + heat energy
2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + heat energy
The reaction of calcium with water is less violent. The heat evolved is
not sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire.
Ca(s) + 2H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)
Calcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed
stick to the surface of the metal.
Magnesium does not react with cold water. It reacts with hot water
to form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts floating due
to the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface.
Metals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react either with cold or
hot water. But they react with steam to form the metal oxide and hydrogen.
2Al(s) + 3H2O(g) → Al2O3(s) + 3H2(g)
3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)
Metals such as lead, copper, silver and gold do not react with water at all.

Do You Know?

Write equations for the reactions of magnesium, aluminium, zinc

Hydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid. It is
because HNO3 is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H2 produced to
water and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides (N2O, NO,
NO2). But magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute
HNO3 to evolve H2 gas.
You must have observed in Activity 3.11, that the rate of formation
of bubbles was the fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction was
also the most exothermic in this case. The reactivity decreases in the
order Mg > Al > Zn > Fe. In the case of copper, no bubbles were seen and
the temperature also remained unchanged. This shows that copper does
not react with dilute HCl.

Aqua regia, (Latin for ‘royal water’) is a freshly prepared mixture of concentrated
hydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in the ratio of 3:1. It can dissolve
gold, even though neither of these acids can do so alone. Aqua regia is a highly
corrosive, fuming liquid. It is one of the few reagents that is able to dissolve gold and
platinum.

We have seen in the previous sections
that all metals are not equally reactive. We
checked the reactivity of various metals
with oxygen, water and acids. But all
metals do not react with these reagents.
So we were not able to put all the metal
samples we had collected in decreasing
order of their reactivity. Displacement
reactions studied in Chapter 1 give better
evidence about the reactivity of metals. It
is simple and easy if metal A displaces
metal B from its solution, it is more reactive than B.

In the above activities, you saw the reactions of metals with a number of
reagents. Why do metals react in this manner? Let us recall what we
learnt about the electronic configuration of elements in Class IX. We
learnt that noble gases, which have a completely filled valence shell, show
little chemical activity. We, therefore, explain the reactivity of elements
as a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.
Let us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and
some metals and non-metals.
We can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electron in its
outermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell
now becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus
of this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has
become 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation
Na+. On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell

and it requires one more electron to complete its octet. If sodium and chlorine
were to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine.
After gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge,
because its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L
and M shells. This gives us a chloride anion C1–. So both these elements
can have a give-and-take relation between them as follows (Fig. 3.5).

You may have observed the following general properties for ionic
compounds—
(i) Physical nature: Ionic compounds are solids and are somewhat
hard because of the strong force of attraction between the positive
and negative ions. These compounds are generally brittle and
break into pieces when pressure is applied.
(ii) Melting and Boiling points: Ionic compounds have high melting
and boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable
amount of energy is required to break the strong inter-ionic
attraction.
(iii) Solubility: Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in
water and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.
(iv) Conduction of Electricity: The conduction of electricity through
a solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution
of an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the
opposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the
solution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct
electricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible
due to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct
electricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state
since the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely
charged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move
freely and conduct electricity.

3 . 4 OCCURRENCE OF MET
METALS
ALS
The earth’s crust is the major source of metals. Seawater also contains
some soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc.
The elements or compounds, which occur naturally in the earth’s crust,
are known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high
percentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted
from it. These minerals are called ores.

3.4.1 Extraction of Metals
You have learnt about the reactivity series of metals. Having this
knowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its
ore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some
are found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of
the activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free

state. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the
free state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as
their sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series
(K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in
nature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series
(Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s
crust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that
the ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very
reactive element and is very abundant on the earth.
Thus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the
following three categories (Fig. 3.9) – (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals
of medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques
are to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.
Several steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from
ores. A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10. Each step is
explained in detail in the following sections.

Figure 3.9
Activity series and
related metallurgy

Figure 3.10 Steps involved in the extraction of metals from ores

3.4.2 Enrichment of Ores
Ores mined from the earth are usually contaminated with large amounts
of impurities such as soil, sand, etc., called gangue. The impurities must
be removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processes

Science

50

Reprint 2025-26

used for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences
between the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore.
Different separation techniques are accordingly employed.

3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series
Metals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these
metals can be reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar
(HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted
into mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury
on further heating.

2HgS(s) + 3O2 (g) Heat
→ 2HgO(s) + 2SO 2 (g)

2HgO(s) Heat
→ 2Hg(l) + O2 (g)

Similarly, copper which is found as Cu2S in nature can be obtained
from its ore by just heating in air.
2Cu2 S + 3O2 (g) Heat

→ 2Cu2O(s) + 2SO2 (g)
2Cu2O + Cu2 S Heat
 
→ 6Cu(s) + SO2 (g)

3.4.4 Extracting Metals in the Middle of the Activity Series
The metals in the middle of the activity series such as iron, zinc, lead,
copper, are moderately reactive. These are usually present as sulphides
or carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as
compared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,
the metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal
oxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly
in the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting. The
carbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited
air. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that
takes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown
as follows –
Roasting
2ZnS(s) + 3O2 (g) Heat

→ 2ZnO(s) + 2SO2 (g)

Calcination
ZnCO3 (s) Heat

→ ZnO(s) + CO2 (g)

The metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by
using suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc
oxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc.
ZnO(s) + C(s) → Zn(s) + CO(g)
You are already familiar with the process of oxidation and reduction
explained in the first Chapter. Obtaining metals from their compounds
is also a reduction process.
Besides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals,
sometimes displacement reactions can also be used. The highly reactive
metals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing
51

Metals and Non-metals

agents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their
compounds. For example, when manganese dioxide is heated with
aluminium powder, the following reaction takes place –
3MnO2(s) + 4Al(s) → 3Mn(l) + 2Al2O3(s) + Heat
Can you identify the substances that are getting oxidised
and reduced?
These displacement reactions are highly exothermic. The
amount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced
in the molten state. In fact, the reaction of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3)
with aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked
machine parts. This reaction is known as the thermit reaction.
Fe2O3(s) + 2Al(s) → 2Fe(l) + Al2O3(s) + Heat

Figure 3.11
Thermit process for
joining railway tracks

3.4.5 Extracting Metals towards the Top of the
Activity Series
The metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive. They cannot
be obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,
carbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,
aluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals
have more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained
by electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium
are obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals
are deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas,
chlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The
reactions are –

Similarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of
aluminium oxide.

3.4.6 Refining of Metals
The metals produced by various reduction processes
described above are not very pure. They contain
impurities, which must be removed to obtain pure metals.
The most widely used method for refining impure metals
is electrolytic refining.

Figure 3.12
Electrolytic refining of copper. The
electrolyte is a solution of acidified copper
sulphate. The anode is impure copper,
whereas, the cathode is a strip of pure
copper. On passing electric current, pure
copper is deposited on the cathode.

Electrolytic Refining: Many metals, such as copper, zinc,
tin, nickel, silver, gold, etc., are refined electrolytically. In
this process, the impure metal is made the anode and a
thin strip of pure metal is made the cathode. A solution of
the metal salt is used as an electrolyte. The apparatus is
set up as shown in Fig. 3.12. On passing the current
through the electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode
dissolves into the electrolyte. An equivalent amount of pure

impurities go into the solution, whereas, the insoluble impurities settle
down at the bottom of the anode and are known as anode mud.

3.5 CORROSION
You have learnt the following about corrosion in Chapter 1 –

Silver articles become black after some time when exposed to air.
This is because it reacts with sulphur in the air to form a coating
of silver sulphide.
Copper reacts with moist carbon dioxide in the air and slowly loses
its shiny brown surface and gains a green coat. This green
substance is basic copper carbonate.
Iron when exposed to moist air for a long time acquires a coating
of a brown flaky substance called rust.
Let us find out the conditions under which iron rusts.

Take three test tubes and place clean iron nails
in each of them.
Label these test tubes A, B and C. Pour some
water in test tube A and cork it.
Pour boiled distilled water in test tube B, add
about 1 mL of oil and cork it. The oil will float on
water and prevent the air from dissolving in the
water.
Put some anhydrous calcium chloride in
test tube C and cork it. Anhydrous calcium
chloride will absorb the moisture, if any, from
the air. Leave these test tubes for a few days and
then observe (Fig. 3.13).

You will observe that iron nails rust in test tube A,
but they do not rust in test tubes B and C. In the test
tube A, the nails are exposed to both air and water. In
the test tube B, the nails are exposed to only water, and
the nails in test tube C are exposed to dry air. What
does this tell us about the conditions under which iron
articles rust?

in the water. In tube C, the air is dry.

3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion

Do You Know?

The rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,
galvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.
Galvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting
by coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is
protected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you
reason this out?
Alloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.
We can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is
the most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is
because pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is
mixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard
and strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get
stainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed
with some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties
of any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.
The substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a
homogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a nonmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,
dissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled
to room temperature.

Pure gold, known as 24 carat gold, is very soft. It is, therefore, not suitable for making
jewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India,
22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is
alloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver.

Iron pillar at Delhi

More to Know!

If one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an
amalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is
less than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and
zinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are
not good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making
electrical circuits. Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low
melting point and is used for welding electrical wires together.

The wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy
The iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more
than 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India. They had
developed a process which prevented iron from rusting. For
its quality of rust resistance it has been examined by scientists
from all parts of the world. The iron pillar is 8 m high and
weighs 6 tonnes (6000 kg).

programmed to accept data (input), process it and 
generate result (output). A computer along with 
additional hardware and software together is called a 
computer system. 

A computer system primarily comprises of a central 
processing unit, memory, input/output devices, and 
storage devices. All these components function together 
as a single unit to deliver the desired output. A computer

as the brain of the computer. It is also 

commonly called 'processor' also. Physically, a CPU can 
be placed on one or more microchips called integrated 
circuits (IC). The ICs comprise semiconductor materials. 

The CPU is given instructions and data through 
programs. The CPU then fetches the program and data 
from the memory and performs arithmetic and logical 
operations as per the given instructions and stores the 
result back to memory.

While processing, the CPU stores the data as well 
as instructions in its local memory, 'called' registers. 
Registers are part of the CPU chip and they are limited 
in size and number. Different registers are used for 
storing data, instructions or intermediate results. 

Other than the registers, the CPU has two main 
components — Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Control 
Unit (CU). ALU performs all the arithmetic and logic

the data as well as instructions are stored permanently 
in additional storage locations called secondary memory.
1.1.3	Output Devices Speaker

The device that receives data from a computer system 
for display, physical production, etc., is called output 
device. It converts digital information into human-
understandable form. For example, monitor, projector, Printer
headphone, speaker, printer, etc. Some output devices 
are shown in Figure 1.3. A braille display monitor is 
useful for a visually challenged person to understand 
the textual output generated by computers. 3D printer

A printer is the most commonly used device to get 
output in physical (hardcopy) form. Three types of Figure 1.3:	Output Devices
commonly used printers are inkjet, laserjet and dot 
matrix. Now-a-days, there is a new type of printer 
called 3D-printer, which is used to build physical 
replica of a digital 3D design. These printers are being 
used in manufacturing industries to create prototypes 
of products. Their usage is also being explored in the 
medical field, particularly for developing body organs.

1.2	E volution of Computer

From the simple calculator to a modern day powerful 
data processor, computing devices have evolved in a 
relatively short span of time. The evolution of computing 
devices is shown through a timeline at Figure 1.5.

The Von Neumann architecture is shown in Figure 
1.4. It consists of a Central Processing Unit (CPU) 
for processing arithmetic and logical instructions, a 
memory to store data and programs, input and output 
devices and communication channels to send/receive 
the output data. Electronic Numerical Integrator And 
Computer (ENIAC) is the first 
binary programmable computer 
based on Von Neumann 
architecture.

1.3	C omputer Memory

A computer system needs memory to store the data and 
instructions for processing. Whenever we talk about 
the “memory” of a computer system, we usually talk 
about the main or primary memory. The secondary 
memory (also called storage device) is used to store 
data, instructions and results permanently and for Think and Reflect
future use. How do different

basic units of memory, are called bits. Further, these 
bits are grouped together to form words. A 4-bit word 
is called a Nibble. Examples of nibble are 1001, 1010, 
0010, etc. A two nibble word, i.e., 8-bit word is called a 
byte, for example, 01000110, 01111100, 10000001, etc.

Like any other standard unit, bytes are grouped

1.3.2	Types of Memory
Human beings memorise many things over a lifetime, 
and recall from memory to make a decision or take 
some action. However, we cannot rely on our memory 
completely, so we make notes and store important 
data and information using other mediums such as 
notebook, manual, journal, document etc. for a long-
term storage. Similarly, computers have two types of 
memories namely —primary memory and secondary 
memory. 
(A)	 Primary Memory
The primary memory is an essential component of a 
computer system. Program and data are loaded into the 
primary memory before processing. The CPU interacts 
directly with the primary memory to perform read/
write operation. It is of two types viz. i) Random access 
memory (RAM), and ii) Read only memory (ROM).

RAM is volatile i.e. as long as the power is supplied to 
the computer, it retains the data in it. But as soon as the 
power supply is turned off, all the contents of RAM are

On the other hand, ROM is non-volatile, means its 
contents are not lost even when the power is turned off. 
It is used as a small but faster permanent storage for 
the contents which are rarely changed. For example, the

Computer System 7

startup program (boot loader) that loads the operating 
system into RAM is stored in a ROM.
(B)	 Cache Memory
RAM is faster than secondary storage, but not as fast as 
a computer processor. So, because of RAM, a CPU may Pen 
have to slow down. To speed up the operations of the Drive
CPU, a very high speed memory is placed between the 
CPU and the primary memory known as cache. It stores 
the copies of the data from frequently accessed primary 
memory locations, thus, reducing the average time 
required to access data from primary memory. When 
the CPU needs to access memory, it first examines the 
cache. In case the requirement is met, it is read from 
the cache, otherwise the primary memory is accessed.
(C)	 Secondary Memory
Primary memory has limited storage capacity and 
is either volatile (RAM) or read-only (ROM). Thus, a 
computer system needs auxiliary or secondary memory 
to permanently store the data or instructions for 
future use. The secondary memory is non-volatile and 
has larger storage capacity than primary memory. It 
is slower and cheaper than the main memory. But, it 
cannot be accessed directly by the CPU. Contents of 
secondary storage need to be first brought into the main Figure 1.7:	Storage Devices 
memory for the CPU to access. Examples of secondary 
memory devices include Hard Disk Drive (HDD), CD/
DVD, Memory Card, etc., as shown in Figure 1.7.

However, these days, there are secondary storage 
devices like Solid-State Drive (SSD) which support very 
fast data transfer speed as compared to earlier HDDs. 
Also, data transfer between computers have become 
easier and simpler due to the availability of small sized 
and portable flash/pen drives. 
1.3.3	Data Capturing, Storage, and Retrieval
To process the data, we need to first input or capture 
the data. This is followed by its storage in a file or a 
database so that it can be used in the future. Whenever 
data is to be processed, it is first retrieved from the file/
database so that we can perform further actions on it. Activity 1.1

orbiting satellites etc. comments/ports over multiple 
social media are also captured as data. Sometimes, 
heterogeneity among data sources makes data capturing 
a complex task.

Figure 1.8:	Capturing Data (B)	 Data Storage 
using Barcode Reader It is the process of storing the captured data for 

processing later. Now-a-days data is being produced at 
a very high rate, and therefore data storage has become 
a challenging task. However, the decrease in the cost 
of digital storage devices has helped in simplifying 
this task. There are numerous digital storage devices 
available in the market as shown in Figure 1.7.

Data keeps on increasing with time. Hence, the 
storage devices also require to be upgraded periodically.

digital format. (C)	 Data Retrieval 

It involves fetching data from the storage devices, for its 
processing as per the user requirement. As databases 
grow, the challenges involved in search and retrieval of 
the data in acceptable time, also increase. Minimising 
data access time is crucial for faster data processing.
1.3.4	Data Deletion and Recovery
One of the biggest threats associated with digital data is 
its deletion. The storage devices can malfunction or crash 
down resulting in the deletion of the stored data. Users 
can accidentally erase data from storage devices, or a 
hacker/malware can delete the digital data intentionally.

Deleting digitally stored data means changing the 
details of data at bit level, which can be very time-
consuming. Therefore, when any data is simply deleted,

data or data from a 
corrupted device. In case data gets deleted accidentally or corrupted, 

there arises a need to recover the data. Recovery of the 
data is possible only if the contents/memory space

Computer System 9

marked as deleted have not been overwritten by some 
other data. Data recovery is a process of retrieving 
deleted, corrupted and lost data from secondary 
storage devices. 

There are usually two security concerns associated 
with data. One is its deletion by some unauthorised 
person or software. These concerns can be avoided 
by limiting access to the computer system and using 
passwords for user accounts and files, wherever 
possible. There is also an option of encrypting files to 
protect them from unwanted modification.

The other concern is related to unwanted recovery 
of data by unauthorised user/software. Many a times,

1.4	 Software 
Till now, we have studied about the physical 
components or the hardware of the computer system. 
But the hardware is of no use on its own. Hardware 
needs to be operated by a set of instructions. These 
sets of instructions are referred to as software. It is that 
component of a computer system, which we cannot 
touch or view physically. It comprises of the instructions 
and data to be processed using the computer hardware.

10 Informatics Practices – Class XI

1.4.1	Need of Software 
The sole purpose of a software is to make computer 
hardware useful and operational. A software knows 
how to make different hardware components of a 
computer work and communicate with each other as 
well as with the end user. We cannot talk to or instruct 
the hardware of a computer directly. Hence, software 
acts as an interface between human users and 
the hardware.

Depending on the mode of interaction with hardware 
and functions to be performed, software can be broadly 
classified into three categories viz. i) System software 
ii) Programming tools and iii) Application software. The 
categorisation of software is shown in Figure 1.9.
1.4.2	System Software
The software that provides the basic functionality 
to operate a computer by interacting directly with its 
constituent hardware is termed as system software. A 
system software knows how to operate and use different 
hardware components of a computer. It provides services 
directly to the end user, or to some other software. 
Examples of system software include operating systems, 
system utilities, device drivers, etc.

(A)	 Operating System
As the name implies, operating system is a system 
software that operates the computer. An operating 
system is the most basic system software, without 
which other software cannot work. The operating system 
manages other application programs and provides 
access and security to the users of the system. Some 
of the popular operating systems are Windows, Linux, 
Macintosh, Ubuntu, Fedora, Android, iOS, etc. 

(B)	 System Utilities
Software used for maintenance and configuration of the 
computer system is called system utility. Some system 
utilities are shipped with the operating system, for 
example disk defragmentation tool, formatting utility, 
system restore utility, etc. Another set of utilities are 
those which are not shipped with the operating system 
but are required to improve the performance of the 
system, for example, anti-virus software, disk cleaner 
tool, disk compression software, etc.

(C)	 Device Drivers
As the name signifies, the purpose 
of a device driver is to ensure 
proper functioning of a particular 
device. When it comes to the overall 
working of a computer system, the 
operating system does the work. 
But everyday new devices and 
components are being added to a 
computer system. It is not possible

manage all of the existing and new 
peripherals, where each device 
has diverse characteristics. The 
responsibility for overall control, 
operation, and management of a Figure 1.9:	 Categorisation of Software

particular device at the hardware level is delegated to 
its device driver.

The device driver acts as an interface between the 
device and the operating system. It provides required 
services by hiding the details of operations performed 
at the hardware level of the device. Just like a language Activity 1.5

and fabric and get it stitched as desired.
1.4.4	Proprietary or Free and Open Source Software 
Developers of some software allow public to freely use 
their software along with source code with an aim to 
improve further with each other’s help. Such software is 
known as Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). For 
example, the source code of operating system Ubuntu is 
freely accessible for anyone with the required knowledge 
to improve/add new functionality. More examples of 
FOSS include Python, Libreoffice, Openoffice, Mozilla 
Firefox, etc. Sometimes, software are freely available 
for use but source code may not be available. Such 
software is called freeware. Examples of freeware are 
Skype, Adobe Reader etc. 

When software to be used has to be purchased from 
the vendor who has the copyright of the software, then 
it is a proprietary software. Examples of proprietary 
software include Microsoft Windows, Tally, Quickheal 
etc. A software can be freeware or open source or 
proprietary software depending upon the terms and 
conditions of the person or group who has developed 
and released that software.

popularity and set a new trend among users. In this 
chapter, we will learn about some emerging trends 
that will make a huge impact (in the future) on digital 
economy and interaction in digital societies.

2.2	 Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
Have you ever wondered how maps in your smartphone 
are able to guide you to take the fastest route to your 
destination by analysing real time data, such as traffic 
congestion? On uploading a photo on a social networking 
site, has it ever happened that your friends in the 
photograph were recognised and tagged automatically? 
These are some of the examples of application of 
Artificial Intelligence. The intelligent digital personal 
assistants like Siri, Google Now, Cortana, Alexa are 
all powered by AI. Artificial Intelligence endeavours to 
simulate the natural intelligence of human beings into 
machines, thus making them behave intelligently. An

decision making. decisions based on it. AI system can also learn from 

past experiences or outcomes to make new decisions.
2.2.1	Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subsystem of Artificial 
Intelligence, wherein computers have the ability to learn 
from data using statistical techniques, without being 
explicitly programmed by a human being. It comprises 
algorithms that use data to learn on their own and make 
predictions. These algorithms, called models, are first 
trained and tested using a training data and testing 
data, respectively. After successive trainings, once these 
models are able to give results to an acceptable level of 
accuracy, they are used to make predictions about new 
and unknown data.

computers using human 
spoken languages, such as 
Hindi, English, etc.

In fact it is possible to 
search the web or operate or 
control our devices using our 
voice. All this has been possible 
by NLP. An NLP system can 
perform text-to-speech and Figure 2.1:	Use of natural language processing
speech-to-text conversion as 
depicted in Figure 2.1. 

Machine translation is a rapidly emerging field where 
machines are able to translate texts from one language 
to another with fair amount of correctness. Another 
emerging application area is automated customer 
service where a computer software can interact with 
customers to serve their queries or complaints.
2.2.3	Immersive Experiences 
With the three-dimensional (3D) videography, the 
joy of watching movies in theatres has reached to 
a new level. Video games are also being developed to 
provide immersive experiences to the player. Immersive 
experiences allow us to visualise, feel and react by 
stimulating our senses. It enhances our interaction and 
involvement, making them more realistic and engaging. 
Immersive experiences have been used in the field of 
training, such as driving simulators (Figure 2.2), flight Figure 2.2:	Driving Simulator
simulator and so on. Immersive experience can be 
achieved using virtual reality and augmented reality.
(A)	 Virtual Reality 
Everything that we experience in our reality is perceived 
through our senses. From this came the idea that 
if we can present our senses with made-up or non-
real information, our perception of reality would also 
alter in response to that. Virtual Reality (VR) is a 
three-dimensional, computer-generated situation that 
simulates the real world. The user can interact with and 
explore that environment by getting immersed in it while 
interacting with the objects and other actions of the user. 
At present, it is achieved with the help of VR Headsets. 
In order to make the experience of VR more realistic, it 
promotes other sensory information like sound, smell, 
motion, temperature, etc. It is a comparatively new field Figure 2.3:	VR Headset

of the underlying physical 
world through additional (B)	 Augmented Reality 

information. The superimposition of computer generated perceptual 
information over the existing physical surroundings is 
called as Augmented Reality (AR). It adds components 
of the digital world to the physical world, along with 
the associated tactile and other sensory requirements, 
thereby making the environment interactive and 
digitally manipulable. Users can access information 
about the nearest places with reference to their current 
location. They can get information about places and 
choose on the basis of user reviews. With thet help of 
location-based AR App, travellers can access real-time 
information of historical places just by pointing their

2.2.4	Robotics 
A robot is basically a machine capable of carrying out one 
or more tasks automatically with accuracy and precision. 
Unlike other machines, a robot is programmable, which 
means it can follow the instructions given through

2.3	 Big Data 
With technology making 
an inroad into almost every 
sphere of our lives, data 
is being produced at a 
colossal rate. Today, there 
are over a billion Internet 
users, and a majority of 
the world’s web traffic is 
coming from smartphones. 
Figure 2.8 shows that at 
the current pace, around 
2.5 quintillion bytes of data 
are created each day, and 
the pace is increasing with 
the continuous evolution of 
the Internet of Things (IoT).

This results in the 
generation of data sets 
of enormous volume and 
complexity called Big 
Data. Such data cannot 
be processed and analysed 
using traditional data Figure 2.8:	Sources of big data (numbers are approximate)

processing tools as the data is not only voluminous, 
but also unstructured like our posts, instant messages 
and chats, photographs that we share through various 
sites, our tweets, blog articles, news items, opinion

How are your digital Big data not only represents voluminous data, it also 
activities contributing 
to generation of Big involves various challenges like integration, storage, 
data? analysis, searching, processing, transfer, querying and 

visualisation of such data. Big data sometimes hold rich 
information and knowledge which is of high business 
value, and therefore there is a keen effort in developing 
software and methods to process and analyse big data.
2.3.1	Characteristics of Big Data
Big data exhibits following five characteristics shown in 
Figure 2.9, that distinguish it from traditional data.
(A)	 Volume
The most prominent characteristic of big data is its 
enormous size. If a particular data set is of such large 
size that it is difficult to process it with traditional DBMS 
tools, it can be termed as big data.
(B)	 Velocity
It represents the rate at which the data under 
consideration is being generated and stored. Big data 
has an exponentially higher rate of generation than 
traditional data sets. 
(C)	 Variety
It asserts that a data set has varied data, such as 
structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. 

Figure 2.9:	Characteristics Some examples are text, images, videos, web pages and 
of big data so on. 

(D)	 Veracity
Big data can be sometimes inconsistent, biased, noisy 
or there can be abnormality in the data or issues 
with the data collection methods. Veracity refers to 
the trustworthiness of the data because processing 
such incorrect data can give wrong results or mislead 
the interpretations.
(E)	 Value
Big data is not only just a big pile of data, but also 
possess to have hidden patterns and useful knowledge 
which can be of high business value. But as there is cost 
of investment of resources in processing big data, we 
should make a preliminary enquiry to see the potential

Emerging Trends 21

of the big data in terms of value discovery or else our 
efforts could be in vain.
2.3.2	Data Analytics 
Data analytics is the process of examining data sets 
in order to draw conclusions about the information 
they contain, with the aid of specialised systems 
and software.

Data analytics technologies and techniques are 
becoming popular day-by-day. They are used in 
commercial industries to enable organisations to make 
more informed business decisions. In the field of science 
and technology, it can be useful for researchers to verify 
or disprove scientific models, theories and hypotheses. 
Pandas is a library of the programming language 
Python that can be used as a tool to make data analysis 
much simpler.

2.4	 Internet of Things (IoT)
The term computer network that we commonly use is 
the network of computers. Such a network consists of a 
laptop, desktop, server, or a portable device like tablet, 
smartphone, smartwatch, etc., connected through Activity 2.3

wire or wireless. We can communicate between these Explore and list a few 
devices using Internet or LAN. Now imagine what if IoT devices available in 

the market. 
our bulbs, fans and refrigerator also became a part of 
this network. How will they communicate with each 
other, and what will they communicate?  Think about 
the advantages and tasks that can be accomplished 
if all these devices with smart connectivity features 
are able to communicate amongst themselves and 
we are also able to communicate 
with them using computers 
or smartphones!

The ‘Internet of Things’ is a 
network of devices that have an 
embedded hardware and software 
to communicate (connect and 
exchange data) with other 
devices on the same network 
as shown in Figure 2.10. At 
present, in a typical household, 
many devices have advanced 
hardware (microcontrollers) and 
software. These devices are used Figure 2.10:	Internet of Things (IoT)

22 Informatics Practices – Class XI

in isolation from each other, with maximum human 
intervention needed for operational directions and 
input data. IoT tends to bring together these devices to 
work in collaboration and assist each other in creating 
an intelligent network of things. For example, if a 
microwave oven, an air conditioner, door lock, CCTV 
camera or other such devices are enabled to connect to 
the Internet, we can access and remotely control them 
on-the-go using our smartphone.
2.4.1	Web of Things (WoT) 
Internet of Things allows us to interact with different 
devices through Internet with the help of smartphones 
or computers, thus creating a personal network. But to 
interact with ‘n’ number of different devices, we need 

Activity 2.4 to install ‘n’ different apps. Wouldn’t it be convenient

other utilities. them together? Web of Things (WoT) allows the use of 

web services to connect anything in the physical world, 
besides human identities on web. It will pave way for 
creating smart homes, smart offices, smart cities and 
so on.
2.4.2	Sensors 
What happens when you hold your mobile vertically 
or horizontally? The display also changes to vertical or 
horizontal with respect to the way we hold our mobile. 
This is possible with the help of two sensors, namely 
accelerometer and gyroscope (gyro). The accelerometer 
sensor in the mobile phones detects the orientation of 
the phone. The gyroscope sensors tracks rotation or 
twist of your hand and add to the information supplied 
by the accelerometer.

Sensors are very commonly used for monitoring 
and observing elements in real world applications. The 
evolution of smart electronic sensors is contributing in 
a large way to the evolution of IoT. It will lead to creation 
of new sensor-based, intelligent systems.

A smart sensor is a device that takes input from 
the physical environment and uses built-in computing 
resources to perform predefined functions upon 
detection of specific input and then process data before 
passing it on.

pollution, health and sanitation, traffic congestions, 
public safety and security, besides the overall city 
infrastructures including road, rail, bridge, electricity, 
subways, disaster management, sports facilities, etc. 
These challenges are forcing many city planners around 
the world to look for smarter ways to manage them and 
make cities sustainable and livable.

The idea of a 
smart city as shown 
in Figure 2.11 makes 
use of computer 
and communication 
technology along with 
IoT, WoT  to manage and 
distribute resources 
efficiently. The smart 
building shown here 
uses sensors to detect 
earthquake tremors 
and then warn nearby 
buildings so that they 
can prepare themselves 
accordingly. The smart 
bridge uses wireless 
sensors to detect 
any loose bolt, cable 
or crack. It alerts Figure 2.11:	Smart City
concerned authorities through SMS. The smart tunnel 
also uses wireless sensors to detect any leakage or 
congestion in the tunnel. This information can be sent 
as wireless signals across the network of sensor nodes 
to a centralised computer for further analysis.

Every sphere of life in a city like transportation 
systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste 
management, law enforcement, information systems, 
schools, libraries, hospitals and other community 
services work in unison to optimise the efficiency of city 
operations and services. 

2.5	C loud Computing

Cloud computing is an emerging trend in the field of 
information technology, where computer-based services 
are delivered over the Internet or the cloud, for the case 

Reprint 2025-26

24 Informatics Practices – Class XI

of their accessibility form any where using any smart 
device. The services comprise software, hardware 
(servers), databases, storage, etc. These resources are 
provided by companies called cloud service providers 
and usually charge on pay per use basis, like the way 
we pay for electricity usage. We already use cloud 
services while storing our pictures and files as backup 
on Internet, or host a website on the Internet. Through 
cloud computing, a user can run a bigger application 
or process a large amount of data without having the 
required storage or processing power on their personal 
computer as long as they are connected to the Internet. 
Besides other numerous features, cloud computing 
offers cost-effective, on-demand resources. A user can 
avail need-based resources from the cloud at a very 
reasonable cost. 
2.5.1	Cloud Services 
A better way to understand the cloud is to interpret 
everything as a service. A service corresponds to any 
facility provided by the cloud. There are three standard 
models to categorise different computing services 
delivered through cloud as shown in Figure 2.12. These 
are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a 
Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). 
(A)	 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
The IaaS providers can offer different kinds of computing 
infrastructure, such as servers, virtual machines (VM), 
storage and backup facility, network components, 

operating systems or any other 
hardware or software. Using 
IaaS from the cloud, a user can 
use the hardware infrastructure 
located at a remote location to 
configure, deploy and execute 
any software application on 
that cloud infrastructure. They 
can outsource the hardware 
and software on demand basis 
and pay as per the usage, 
thereby they can save the cost 
of software, hardware and other 
infrastructures as well as the 
cost of setting up, maintenance

Emerging Trends 25

(B)	 Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
Through this service, a user can install and execute 
an application without worrying about the underlying Activity 2.5
infrastructure and their setup. That is, PaaS provides 
a platform or environment to develop, test, and deliver Name a few data 
software applications. Suppose we have developed a centers in India along 

with the major services 
web application using MySQL and Python. To run this that they provide. 
application online, we can avail a pre-configured Apache 
server from cloud having MySQL and Python pre-
installed. Thus, we are not required to install MySQL 
and Python on the cloud, nor do we need to configure 
the web server (Apache, nginx). In PaaS, the user has 
complete control over the deployed application and its 
configuration. It provides a deployment environment 
for developers at a much reduced cost lessening the 
complexity of buying and managing the underlying 
hardware and software.

(C)	 Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS provides on-demand access to application software, 
usually requiring a licensing or subscription by the 
user. While using Google doc, Microsoft Office 365, 
Drop Box, etc., to edit a document online, we use SaaS 
from cloud. A user is not concerned about installation 
or configuration of the software application as long 
as the required software is accessible. Like PaaS, a 
user is provided access to the required configuration 
settings of the application software, that they are using 
at present.

In all of the above standard service models, a user can 
use on-demand infrastructure or platform or software 
and is usually charged as per the usage, thereby 
eliminating the need of a huge investment upfront for 
a new or evolving organisation. In order to utilise and 
harness the benefits of cloud computing, Government 
of India has embarked upon an ambitious initiative — 
‘GI Cloud’ which has been named as ‘MeghRaj’ (https://
cloud.gov.in). 

2.6	G rid Computing

A grid is a computer network of geographically 
dispersed and heterogeneous computational resources 
as shown in Figure 2.13. Unlike cloud, whose primary 
focus is to provide services, a grid is more application 
specific and creates a sense of a virtual supercomputer

or Internet. Therefore, it is economically feasible to 
reuse or utilise their resources like memory as well as 
processing power. The grid provides an opportunity to 
solve computationally intense scientific and research 
problems without actually procuring a costly hardware.

Grid can be of two types — (i) Data grid, used to 
manage large and distributed data having the required 
multi-user access, and (ii) CPU or Processor grid, where 
processing is moved from one PC to another as needed 
or a large task is divided into subtasks, and allotted to 
various nodes for parallel processing.

Grid computing is different from IaaS cloud 
Users sharing their resources service. In case of IaaS cloud service, there 

is a service provider who rents the required 
infrastructure to the users. Whereas in grid 
computing, multiple computing nodes join 
together to solve a common computational 
problem.

2.7	 Blockchains

Traditionally, we perform digital transactions by storing 
data in a centralised database and the transactions 
performed are updated one by one on the database. That 
is how the ticket booking websites or banks operate. 
However, since all the data is stored on a central 
location, there are chances of data being hacked or lost.

The blockchain technology works on the concept of 
decentralised and shared database where each computer

Emerging Trends 27

has a copy of the database. A block can be thought 
as a secured chunk of data or valid transaction. Each 
block has some data called its header, which is visible 
to every other node, while only the owner has access to 
the private data of the block. Such blocks form a chain 
called blockchain as shown in Figure 2.14. We can 
define blockchain as a system that allows a group of 
connected computers to maintain a single updated and 
secure ledger. Each computer or node that participates 
in the blockchain receives a full copy of the database. It 
maintains an ‘append only’ open ledger which is updated 
only after all the nodes within the network authenticate 
the transaction. Safety and security of the transactions 
are ensured because all the members in the network 
keep a copy of the blockchain and so it is not possible 
for a single member of the network to make changes or 
alter data.

The most popular application of blockchains 
technology is in digital currency. However, due to its 
decentralised nature with openness and security, 
blockchains are being seen as one of the ways to ensure 
transparency, accountability and efficiency in business 
as well as in governance systems.

For example, in healthcare, better data sharing 
between healthcare providers would result in a higher Think and Reflect

system can solve the problem of vote alterations and 
other issues. Since everything gets stored in the ledger,

and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning
and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.  We must recognise that,
given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging
with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed
textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other
resources and sites of learning are ignored.  Inculcating creativity and
initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in
learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of
functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in
implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching
days are actually devoted to teaching.  The methods used for teaching and
evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making
children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress
or boredom.  Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of
curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different
stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving
higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering,
discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOKS

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on

students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing

the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with

creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the

exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes

already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into

consideration in this exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:

• Content based on genres of literature in the textbooks and

supplementary readers at different stages of school education

• Content that is meant for achieving Learning Outcomes for developing

language proficiency and is accessible at different stages

• For reducing the curriculum load and examination stress in view of

the prevailing condition of the Pandemic

• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much

interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through

self-learning or peer-learning

• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes

given above.

1.1	 Introduction to Computer System

A computer is an electronic device that can be 
programmed to accept data (input), process it and 
generate result (output). A computer along with 
additional hardware and software together is called a 
computer system. 

A computer system primarily comprises of a central 
processing unit, memory, input/output devices, and 
storage devices. All these components function together 
as a single unit to deliver the desired output. A computer 
system comes in various forms and sizes. It can vary

as the brain of the computer. It is also 

commonly called 'processor' also. Physically, a CPU can 
be placed on one or more microchips called integrated 
circuits (IC). The ICs comprise semiconductor materials. 

The CPU is given instructions and data through 
programs. The CPU then fetches the program and data 
from the memory and performs arithmetic and logical 
operations as per the given instructions and stores the 
result back to memory.

While processing, the CPU stores the data as well 
as instructions in its local memory, 'called' registers. 
Registers are part of the CPU chip and they are limited 
in size and number. Different registers are used for 
storing data, instructions or intermediate results. 

Other than the registers, the CPU has two main 
components — Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Control 
Unit (CU). ALU performs all the arithmetic and logic 
operations that need to be done as per the instruction in a 

Keyboard program. CU controls sequential instruction execution, 
interprets instructions and guides data flow through the 
computer’s memory, ALU and input or output devices. 
CPU is also popularly known as microprocessor.

1.1.2	Input Devices
The devices through which control signals are sent 
to a computer are termed as input devices. These 

Scanner devices convert the input data into a digital form that is 
acceptable by the computer system. Some examples of 
input devices include keyboard, mouse, scanner, touch 
screen, etc., as shown in Figure 1.2. Specially designed 

Touch Screen braille keyboards are also available to help the visually 
impaired for entering data into a computer. Besides, we

computer system. For permanent storage and future use, 
the data as well as instructions are stored permanently 
in additional storage locations called secondary memory.
1.1.3	Output Devices Speaker

The device that receives data from a computer system 
for display, physical production, etc., is called output 
device. It converts digital information into human-
understandable form. For example, monitor, projector, Printer
headphone, speaker, printer, etc. Some output devices 
are shown in Figure 1.3. A braille display monitor is 
useful for a visually challenged person to understand 
the textual output generated by computers. 3D printer

A printer is the most commonly used device to get 
output in physical (hardcopy) form. Three types of Figure 1.3:	Output Devices
commonly used printers are inkjet, laserjet and dot 
matrix. Now-a-days, there is a new type of printer 
called 3D-printer, which is used to build physical 
replica of a digital 3D design. These printers are being 
used in manufacturing industries to create prototypes 
of products. Their usage is also being explored in the 
medical field, particularly for developing body organs.

1.2	E volution of Computer

From the simple calculator to a modern day powerful 
data processor, computing devices have evolved in a 
relatively short span of time. The evolution of computing 
devices is shown through a timeline at Figure 1.5.

The Von Neumann architecture is shown in Figure 
1.4. It consists of a Central Processing Unit (CPU) 
for processing arithmetic and logical instructions, a 
memory to store data and programs, input and output 
devices and communication channels to send/receive 
the output data. Electronic Numerical Integrator And 
Computer (ENIAC) is the first 
binary programmable computer 
based on Von Neumann 
architecture.

basic units of memory, are called bits. Further, these 
bits are grouped together to form words. A 4-bit word 
is called a Nibble. Examples of nibble are 1001, 1010, 
0010, etc. A two nibble word, i.e., 8-bit word is called a 
byte, for example, 01000110, 01111100, 10000001, etc.

Like any other standard unit, bytes are grouped

1.3.2	Types of Memory
Human beings memorise many things over a lifetime, 
and recall from memory to make a decision or take 
some action. However, we cannot rely on our memory 
completely, so we make notes and store important 
data and information using other mediums such as 
notebook, manual, journal, document etc. for a long-
term storage. Similarly, computers have two types of 
memories namely —primary memory and secondary 
memory. 
(A)	 Primary Memory
The primary memory is an essential component of a 
computer system. Program and data are loaded into the 
primary memory before processing. The CPU interacts 
directly with the primary memory to perform read/
write operation. It is of two types viz. i) Random access 
memory (RAM), and ii) Read only memory (ROM).

RAM is volatile i.e. as long as the power is supplied to 
the computer, it retains the data in it. But as soon as the 
power supply is turned off, all the contents of RAM are

On the other hand, ROM is non-volatile, means its 
contents are not lost even when the power is turned off. 
It is used as a small but faster permanent storage for 
the contents which are rarely changed. For example, the

Computer System 7

startup program (boot loader) that loads the operating 
system into RAM is stored in a ROM.
(B)	 Cache Memory
RAM is faster than secondary storage, but not as fast as 
a computer processor. So, because of RAM, a CPU may Pen 
have to slow down. To speed up the operations of the Drive
CPU, a very high speed memory is placed between the 
CPU and the primary memory known as cache. It stores 
the copies of the data from frequently accessed primary 
memory locations, thus, reducing the average time 
required to access data from primary memory. When 
the CPU needs to access memory, it first examines the 
cache. In case the requirement is met, it is read from 
the cache, otherwise the primary memory is accessed.
(C)	 Secondary Memory
Primary memory has limited storage capacity and 
is either volatile (RAM) or read-only (ROM). Thus, a 
computer system needs auxiliary or secondary memory 
to permanently store the data or instructions for 
future use. The secondary memory is non-volatile and 
has larger storage capacity than primary memory. It 
is slower and cheaper than the main memory. But, it 
cannot be accessed directly by the CPU. Contents of 
secondary storage need to be first brought into the main Figure 1.7:	Storage Devices 
memory for the CPU to access. Examples of secondary 
memory devices include Hard Disk Drive (HDD), CD/
DVD, Memory Card, etc., as shown in Figure 1.7.

However, these days, there are secondary storage 
devices like Solid-State Drive (SSD) which support very 
fast data transfer speed as compared to earlier HDDs. 
Also, data transfer between computers have become 
easier and simpler due to the availability of small sized 
and portable flash/pen drives. 
1.3.3	Data Capturing, Storage, and Retrieval
To process the data, we need to first input or capture 
the data. This is followed by its storage in a file or a 
database so that it can be used in the future. Whenever 
data is to be processed, it is first retrieved from the file/
database so that we can perform further actions on it. Activity 1.1

heterogeneity among data sources makes data capturing 
a complex task.

Figure 1.8:	Capturing Data (B)	 Data Storage 
using Barcode Reader It is the process of storing the captured data for 

processing later. Now-a-days data is being produced at 
a very high rate, and therefore data storage has become 
a challenging task. However, the decrease in the cost 
of digital storage devices has helped in simplifying 
this task. There are numerous digital storage devices 
available in the market as shown in Figure 1.7.

storage devices also require to be upgraded periodically.

digital format. (C)	 Data Retrieval 

It involves fetching data from the storage devices, for its 
processing as per the user requirement. As databases 
grow, the challenges involved in search and retrieval of 
the data in acceptable time, also increase. Minimising 
data access time is crucial for faster data processing.
1.3.4	Data Deletion and Recovery
One of the biggest threats associated with digital data is 
its deletion. The storage devices can malfunction or crash 
down resulting in the deletion of the stored data. Users 
can accidentally erase data from storage devices, or a 
hacker/malware can delete the digital data intentionally.

Deleting digitally stored data means changing the 
details of data at bit level, which can be very time-
consuming. Therefore, when any data is simply deleted,

data or data from a 
corrupted device. In case data gets deleted accidentally or corrupted, 

there arises a need to recover the data. Recovery of the 
data is possible only if the contents/memory space

Computer System 9

marked as deleted have not been overwritten by some 
other data. Data recovery is a process of retrieving 
deleted, corrupted and lost data from secondary 
storage devices. 

There are usually two security concerns associated 
with data. One is its deletion by some unauthorised 
person or software. These concerns can be avoided 
by limiting access to the computer system and using 
passwords for user accounts and files, wherever 
possible. There is also an option of encrypting files to 
protect them from unwanted modification.

The other concern is related to unwanted recovery 
of data by unauthorised user/software. Many a times,

1.4	 Software 
Till now, we have studied about the physical 
components or the hardware of the computer system. 
But the hardware is of no use on its own. Hardware 
needs to be operated by a set of instructions. These 
sets of instructions are referred to as software. It is that 
component of a computer system, which we cannot 
touch or view physically. It comprises of the instructions 
and data to be processed using the computer hardware.

1.4.1	Need of Software 
The sole purpose of a software is to make computer 
hardware useful and operational. A software knows 
how to make different hardware components of a 
computer work and communicate with each other as 
well as with the end user. We cannot talk to or instruct 
the hardware of a computer directly. Hence, software 
acts as an interface between human users and 
the hardware.

Depending on the mode of interaction with hardware 
and functions to be performed, software can be broadly 
classified into three categories viz. i) System software 
ii) Programming tools and iii) Application software. The 
categorisation of software is shown in Figure 1.9.
1.4.2	System Software
The software that provides the basic functionality 
to operate a computer by interacting directly with its 
constituent hardware is termed as system software. A 
system software knows how to operate and use different 
hardware components of a computer. It provides services 
directly to the end user, or to some other software. 
Examples of system software include operating systems, 
system utilities, device drivers, etc.

(A)	 Operating System
As the name implies, operating system is a system 
software that operates the computer. An operating 
system is the most basic system software, without 
which other software cannot work. The operating system 
manages other application programs and provides 
access and security to the users of the system. Some 
of the popular operating systems are Windows, Linux, 
Macintosh, Ubuntu, Fedora, Android, iOS, etc. 

(B)	 System Utilities
Software used for maintenance and configuration of the 
computer system is called system utility. Some system 
utilities are shipped with the operating system, for 
example disk defragmentation tool, formatting utility, 
system restore utility, etc. Another set of utilities are 
those which are not shipped with the operating system 
but are required to improve the performance of the 
system, for example, anti-virus software, disk cleaner 
tool, disk compression software, etc.

(C)	 Device Drivers
As the name signifies, the purpose 
of a device driver is to ensure 
proper functioning of a particular 
device. When it comes to the overall 
working of a computer system, the 
operating system does the work. 
But everyday new devices and 
components are being added to a 
computer system. It is not possible

manage all of the existing and new 
peripherals, where each device 
has diverse characteristics. The 
responsibility for overall control,

particular device at the hardware level is delegated to 
its device driver.

The device driver acts as an interface between the 
device and the operating system. It provides required 
services by hiding the details of operations performed 
at the hardware level of the device. Just like a language Activity 1.5

is needed to cater to different requirements of the end- A computer system

It is similar to buying a piece of cloth with specific color 
and fabric and get it stitched as desired.
1.4.4	Proprietary or Free and Open Source Software 
Developers of some software allow public to freely use 
their software along with source code with an aim to 
improve further with each other’s help. Such software is 
known as Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). For 
example, the source code of operating system Ubuntu is 
freely accessible for anyone with the required knowledge 
to improve/add new functionality. More examples of 
FOSS include Python, Libreoffice, Openoffice, Mozilla 
Firefox, etc. Sometimes, software are freely available 
for use but source code may not be available. Such 
software is called freeware. Examples of freeware are 
Skype, Adobe Reader etc. 

When software to be used has to be purchased from 
the vendor who has the copyright of the software, then 
it is a proprietary software. Examples of proprietary 
software include Microsoft Windows, Tally, Quickheal 
etc. A software can be freeware or open source or 
proprietary software depending upon the terms and 
conditions of the person or group who has developed 
and released that software.

2.1	 Introduction to Emerging Trends

Computers have been around for quite some time 
now. New technologies and initiatives emerge 
with each passing day. In order to understand the 
existing technologies and have a better view of the 
developments around us, we must keep an eye on 
the emerging trends. Many new technologies are 
introduced almost every day. Some of these do not 
succeed and fade away over time. Some of these 
new technologies prosper and persist over time, 
gaining attention from users. Emerging trends 
are the state-of-the-art technologies, which gain

popularity and set a new trend among users. In this 
chapter, we will learn about some emerging trends 
that will make a huge impact (in the future) on digital 
economy and interaction in digital societies.

2.2	 Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
Have you ever wondered how maps in your smartphone 
are able to guide you to take the fastest route to your 
destination by analysing real time data, such as traffic 
congestion? On uploading a photo on a social networking 
site, has it ever happened that your friends in the 
photograph were recognised and tagged automatically? 
These are some of the examples of application of 
Artificial Intelligence. The intelligent digital personal 
assistants like Siri, Google Now, Cortana, Alexa are 
all powered by AI. Artificial Intelligence endeavours to 
simulate the natural intelligence of human beings into 
machines, thus making them behave intelligently. An 

A knowledge base is intelligent machine is supposed to imitate some of the

consisting of facts, making and problem solving. In order to make machines 
assumptions and perform tasks with minimum human intervention, they

decision making. decisions based on it. AI system can also learn from 

past experiences or outcomes to make new decisions.
2.2.1	Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subsystem of Artificial 
Intelligence, wherein computers have the ability to learn 
from data using statistical techniques, without being 
explicitly programmed by a human being. It comprises 
algorithms that use data to learn on their own and make 
predictions. These algorithms, called models, are first 
trained and tested using a training data and testing 
data, respectively. After successive trainings, once these 
models are able to give results to an acceptable level of 
accuracy, they are used to make predictions about new 
and unknown data.
2.2.2	Natural Language Processing (NLP)

computers using human 
spoken languages, such as 
Hindi, English, etc.

In fact it is possible to 
search the web or operate or 
control our devices using our 
voice. All this has been possible 
by NLP. An NLP system can 
perform text-to-speech and Figure 2.1:	Use of natural language processing
speech-to-text conversion as 
depicted in Figure 2.1. 

Machine translation is a rapidly emerging field where 
machines are able to translate texts from one language 
to another with fair amount of correctness. Another 
emerging application area is automated customer 
service where a computer software can interact with 
customers to serve their queries or complaints.
2.2.3	Immersive Experiences 
With the three-dimensional (3D) videography, the 
joy of watching movies in theatres has reached to 
a new level. Video games are also being developed to 
provide immersive experiences to the player. Immersive 
experiences allow us to visualise, feel and react by 
stimulating our senses. It enhances our interaction and 
involvement, making them more realistic and engaging. 
Immersive experiences have been used in the field of 
training, such as driving simulators (Figure 2.2), flight Figure 2.2:	Driving Simulator
simulator and so on. Immersive experience can be 
achieved using virtual reality and augmented reality.
(A)	 Virtual Reality 
Everything that we experience in our reality is perceived 
through our senses. From this came the idea that 
if we can present our senses with made-up or non-
real information, our perception of reality would also 
alter in response to that. Virtual Reality (VR) is a 
three-dimensional, computer-generated situation that 
simulates the real world. The user can interact with and 
explore that environment by getting immersed in it while 
interacting with the objects and other actions of the user. 
At present, it is achieved with the help of VR Headsets. 
In order to make the experience of VR more realistic, it 
promotes other sensory information like sound, smell, 
motion, temperature, etc. It is a comparatively new field Figure 2.3:	VR Headset

information. The superimposition of computer generated perceptual 
information over the existing physical surroundings is 
called as Augmented Reality (AR). It adds components 
of the digital world to the physical world, along with 
the associated tactile and other sensory requirements, 
thereby making the environment interactive and 
digitally manipulable. Users can access information 
about the nearest places with reference to their current 
location. They can get information about places and 
choose on the basis of user reviews. With thet help of 
location-based AR App, travellers can access real-time 
information of historical places just by pointing their

2.2.4	Robotics 
A robot is basically a machine capable of carrying out one 
or more tasks automatically with accuracy and precision. 
Unlike other machines, a robot is programmable, which 
means it can follow the instructions given through

2.3	 Big Data 
With technology making 
an inroad into almost every 
sphere of our lives, data 
is being produced at a 
colossal rate. Today, there 
are over a billion Internet 
users, and a majority of 
the world’s web traffic is 
coming from smartphones. 
Figure 2.8 shows that at 
the current pace, around 
2.5 quintillion bytes of data 
are created each day, and 
the pace is increasing with 
the continuous evolution of 
the Internet of Things (IoT).

This results in the 
generation of data sets 
of enormous volume and 
complexity called Big 
Data. Such data cannot 
be processed and analysed 
using traditional data Figure 2.8:	Sources of big data (numbers are approximate)

processing tools as the data is not only voluminous, 
but also unstructured like our posts, instant messages 
and chats, photographs that we share through various 
sites, our tweets, blog articles, news items, opinion

How are your digital Big data not only represents voluminous data, it also 
activities contributing 
to generation of Big involves various challenges like integration, storage, 
data? analysis, searching, processing, transfer, querying and 

visualisation of such data. Big data sometimes hold rich 
information and knowledge which is of high business 
value, and therefore there is a keen effort in developing 
software and methods to process and analyse big data.
2.3.1	Characteristics of Big Data
Big data exhibits following five characteristics shown in 
Figure 2.9, that distinguish it from traditional data.
(A)	 Volume
The most prominent characteristic of big data is its 
enormous size. If a particular data set is of such large 
size that it is difficult to process it with traditional DBMS 
tools, it can be termed as big data.
(B)	 Velocity
It represents the rate at which the data under 
consideration is being generated and stored. Big data 
has an exponentially higher rate of generation than 
traditional data sets. 
(C)	 Variety
It asserts that a data set has varied data, such as 
structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. 

Figure 2.9:	Characteristics Some examples are text, images, videos, web pages and 
of big data so on. 

(D)	 Veracity
Big data can be sometimes inconsistent, biased, noisy 
or there can be abnormality in the data or issues 
with the data collection methods. Veracity refers to 
the trustworthiness of the data because processing 
such incorrect data can give wrong results or mislead 
the interpretations.
(E)	 Value
Big data is not only just a big pile of data, but also 
possess to have hidden patterns and useful knowledge 
which can be of high business value. But as there is cost 
of investment of resources in processing big data, we 
should make a preliminary enquiry to see the potential

Emerging Trends 21

of the big data in terms of value discovery or else our 
efforts could be in vain.
2.3.2	Data Analytics 
Data analytics is the process of examining data sets 
in order to draw conclusions about the information 
they contain, with the aid of specialised systems 
and software.

Data analytics technologies and techniques are 
becoming popular day-by-day. They are used in 
commercial industries to enable organisations to make 
more informed business decisions. In the field of science 
and technology, it can be useful for researchers to verify 
or disprove scientific models, theories and hypotheses. 
Pandas is a library of the programming language 
Python that can be used as a tool to make data analysis 
much simpler.

2.4	 Internet of Things (IoT)
The term computer network that we commonly use is 
the network of computers. Such a network consists of a 
laptop, desktop, server, or a portable device like tablet, 
smartphone, smartwatch, etc., connected through Activity 2.3

wire or wireless. We can communicate between these Explore and list a few 
devices using Internet or LAN. Now imagine what if IoT devices available in 

the market. 
our bulbs, fans and refrigerator also became a part of 
this network. How will they communicate with each 
other, and what will they communicate?  Think about 
the advantages and tasks that can be accomplished 
if all these devices with smart connectivity features 
are able to communicate amongst themselves and 
we are also able to communicate 
with them using computers 
or smartphones!

The ‘Internet of Things’ is a 
network of devices that have an 
embedded hardware and software 
to communicate (connect and 
exchange data) with other 
devices on the same network 
as shown in Figure 2.10. At 
present, in a typical household, 
many devices have advanced 
hardware (microcontrollers) and 
software. These devices are used Figure 2.10:	Internet of Things (IoT)

22 Informatics Practices – Class XI

in isolation from each other, with maximum human 
intervention needed for operational directions and 
input data. IoT tends to bring together these devices to 
work in collaboration and assist each other in creating 
an intelligent network of things. For example, if a 
microwave oven, an air conditioner, door lock, CCTV 
camera or other such devices are enabled to connect to 
the Internet, we can access and remotely control them 
on-the-go using our smartphone.
2.4.1	Web of Things (WoT) 
Internet of Things allows us to interact with different 
devices through Internet with the help of smartphones 
or computers, thus creating a personal network. But to 
interact with ‘n’ number of different devices, we need

other utilities. them together? Web of Things (WoT) allows the use of 

web services to connect anything in the physical world, 
besides human identities on web. It will pave way for 
creating smart homes, smart offices, smart cities and 
so on.
2.4.2	Sensors 
What happens when you hold your mobile vertically 
or horizontally? The display also changes to vertical or 
horizontal with respect to the way we hold our mobile. 
This is possible with the help of two sensors, namely 
accelerometer and gyroscope (gyro). The accelerometer 
sensor in the mobile phones detects the orientation of 
the phone. The gyroscope sensors tracks rotation or 
twist of your hand and add to the information supplied 
by the accelerometer.

Sensors are very commonly used for monitoring 
and observing elements in real world applications. The 
evolution of smart electronic sensors is contributing in 
a large way to the evolution of IoT. It will lead to creation 
of new sensor-based, intelligent systems.

A smart sensor is a device that takes input from 
the physical environment and uses built-in computing 
resources to perform predefined functions upon 
detection of specific input and then process data before 
passing it on.

infrastructures including road, rail, bridge, electricity, 
subways, disaster management, sports facilities, etc. 
These challenges are forcing many city planners around 
the world to look for smarter ways to manage them and 
make cities sustainable and livable.

The idea of a 
smart city as shown 
in Figure 2.11 makes 
use of computer 
and communication

IoT, WoT  to manage and 
distribute resources 
efficiently. The smart

buildings so that they 
can prepare themselves 
accordingly. The smart 
bridge uses wireless 
sensors to detect 
any loose bolt, cable 
or crack. It alerts Figure 2.11:	Smart City
concerned authorities through SMS. The smart tunnel 
also uses wireless sensors to detect any leakage or 
congestion in the tunnel. This information can be sent 
as wireless signals across the network of sensor nodes 
to a centralised computer for further analysis.

Every sphere of life in a city like transportation 
systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste 
management, law enforcement, information systems, 
schools, libraries, hospitals and other community 
services work in unison to optimise the efficiency of city 
operations and services. 

2.5	C loud Computing

Cloud computing is an emerging trend in the field of 
information technology, where computer-based services 
are delivered over the Internet or the cloud, for the case 

Reprint 2025-26

24 Informatics Practices – Class XI

of their accessibility form any where using any smart 
device. The services comprise software, hardware 
(servers), databases, storage, etc. These resources are 
provided by companies called cloud service providers 
and usually charge on pay per use basis, like the way 
we pay for electricity usage. We already use cloud 
services while storing our pictures and files as backup 
on Internet, or host a website on the Internet. Through 
cloud computing, a user can run a bigger application 
or process a large amount of data without having the 
required storage or processing power on their personal 
computer as long as they are connected to the Internet. 
Besides other numerous features, cloud computing 
offers cost-effective, on-demand resources. A user can 
avail need-based resources from the cloud at a very 
reasonable cost. 
2.5.1	Cloud Services 
A better way to understand the cloud is to interpret 
everything as a service. A service corresponds to any 
facility provided by the cloud. There are three standard 
models to categorise different computing services 
delivered through cloud as shown in Figure 2.12. These 
are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a 
Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). 
(A)	 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
The IaaS providers can offer different kinds of computing 
infrastructure, such as servers, virtual machines (VM), 
storage and backup facility, network components, 

operating systems or any other 
hardware or software. Using 
IaaS from the cloud, a user can 
use the hardware infrastructure 
located at a remote location to 
configure, deploy and execute 
any software application on 
that cloud infrastructure. They 
can outsource the hardware 
and software on demand basis 
and pay as per the usage, 
thereby they can save the cost 
of software, hardware and other 
infrastructures as well as the 
cost of setting up, maintenance

Emerging Trends 25

(B)	 Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
Through this service, a user can install and execute 
an application without worrying about the underlying Activity 2.5
infrastructure and their setup. That is, PaaS provides 
a platform or environment to develop, test, and deliver Name a few data 
software applications. Suppose we have developed a centers in India along 

with the major services 
web application using MySQL and Python. To run this that they provide. 
application online, we can avail a pre-configured Apache 
server from cloud having MySQL and Python pre-
installed. Thus, we are not required to install MySQL 
and Python on the cloud, nor do we need to configure 
the web server (Apache, nginx). In PaaS, the user has 
complete control over the deployed application and its 
configuration. It provides a deployment environment 
for developers at a much reduced cost lessening the 
complexity of buying and managing the underlying 
hardware and software.

(C)	 Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS provides on-demand access to application software, 
usually requiring a licensing or subscription by the 
user. While using Google doc, Microsoft Office 365, 
Drop Box, etc., to edit a document online, we use SaaS 
from cloud. A user is not concerned about installation 
or configuration of the software application as long 
as the required software is accessible. Like PaaS, a 
user is provided access to the required configuration 
settings of the application software, that they are using 
at present.

In all of the above standard service models, a user can 
use on-demand infrastructure or platform or software 
and is usually charged as per the usage, thereby 
eliminating the need of a huge investment upfront for 
a new or evolving organisation. In order to utilise and 
harness the benefits of cloud computing, Government 
of India has embarked upon an ambitious initiative — 
‘GI Cloud’ which has been named as ‘MeghRaj’ (https://
cloud.gov.in). 

2.6	G rid Computing

A grid is a computer network of geographically 
dispersed and heterogeneous computational resources 
as shown in Figure 2.13. Unlike cloud, whose primary 
focus is to provide services, a grid is more application 
specific and creates a sense of a virtual supercomputer

or Internet. Therefore, it is economically feasible to 
reuse or utilise their resources like memory as well as 
processing power. The grid provides an opportunity to 
solve computationally intense scientific and research 
problems without actually procuring a costly hardware.

Grid can be of two types — (i) Data grid, used to 
manage large and distributed data having the required 
multi-user access, and (ii) CPU or Processor grid, where 
processing is moved from one PC to another as needed 
or a large task is divided into subtasks, and allotted to 
various nodes for parallel processing.

Grid computing is different from IaaS cloud 
Users sharing their resources service. In case of IaaS cloud service, there 

is a service provider who rents the required 
infrastructure to the users. Whereas in grid 
computing, multiple computing nodes join 
together to solve a common computational 
problem.

2.7	 Blockchains

Traditionally, we perform digital transactions by storing 
data in a centralised database and the transactions 
performed are updated one by one on the database. That 
is how the ticket booking websites or banks operate. 
However, since all the data is stored on a central 
location, there are chances of data being hacked or lost.

The blockchain technology works on the concept of 
decentralised and shared database where each computer

has a copy of the database. A block can be thought 
as a secured chunk of data or valid transaction. Each 
block has some data called its header, which is visible 
to every other node, while only the owner has access to 
the private data of the block. Such blocks form a chain 
called blockchain as shown in Figure 2.14. We can 
define blockchain as a system that allows a group of 
connected computers to maintain a single updated and 
secure ledger. Each computer or node that participates 
in the blockchain receives a full copy of the database. It 
maintains an ‘append only’ open ledger which is updated 
only after all the nodes within the network authenticate 
the transaction. Safety and security of the transactions 
are ensured because all the members in the network 
keep a copy of the blockchain and so it is not possible 
for a single member of the network to make changes or 
alter data.

The request is 
Someone requests broadcast to all 

a transaction nodes in the 
network

If verified by all nodes, 
The transaction the block get added in the 

is complete already existing chain of 
blocks

Figure 2.14:	Block chain technology

The most popular application of blockchains 
technology is in digital currency. However, due to its 
decentralised nature with openness and security, 
blockchains are being seen as one of the ways to ensure 
transparency, accountability and efficiency in business 
as well as in governance systems.

For example, in healthcare, better data sharing 
between healthcare providers would result in a higher Think and Reflect
probability of accurate diagnosis, more effective Name any two areas 
treatments, and the overall increased ability of healthcare other than those given 
organisations to deliver cost-effective care. Another where the concept of 
potential application can be for  land registration records, blockchain technology

Notes 3.2	 Python Keywords

Keywords are reserved words. Each keyword has a 
specific meaning to the Python interpreter. As Python 
is case sensitive, keywords must be written exactly as 
given in Table 3.1.

Table 3.1 Python keywords
False class finally is return
None continue for lambda try
True def from nonlocal while
and del global not with
as elif if or yield
assert else import pass  
break except in raise  

3.3	 Identifiers
In programming languages, identifiers are names used 
to identify a variable, function, or other entities in a 
program. The rules for naming an identifier in Python 
are as follows: 
•	 The name should begin with an uppercase or a 

lowercase alphabet or an underscore sign (_). This 
may be followed by any combination of characters 
a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or underscore (_). Thus, an identifier 
cannot start with a digit.

•	 It can be of any length. (However, it is preferred to 
keep it short and meaningful). 

•	 It should not be a keyword or reserved word given in 
Table 3.1.

•	 We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, %, etc. 
in identifiers.
For example, to find the average of marks obtained 

by a student in three subjects namely Maths, English, 
Informatics Practices (IP), we can choose the identifiers 
as marksMaths, marksEnglish, marksIP and avg 
rather than a, b, c, or A, B, C, as such alphabets do not 
give any clue about the data that variable refers to.

avg = (marksMaths + marksEnglish + marksIP)/3

3.4	 Variables

Variable is an identifier whose value can change. For 
example  variable age can have  different  value for 
different person. Variable name should be unique in a 
program. Value of a variable can be string (for example,

Every value belongs to a specific data type in Python. 
Data type identifies the type of data which a variable 
can hold and the operations that can be performed on 
those data. Figure 3.6 enlists the data types available 
in Python.

Dictionaries

Figure 3.6:	Different Data Types in Python
3.5.1	Number
Number data type stores numerical values only. It is 
further classified into three different types: int, float 
and complex.

Table 3.2 Numeric data types
Type/ Class Description Examples

int integer numbers -12, -3, 0, 123, 2
float floating point numbers -2.04, 4.0, 14.23

complex complex numbers 3 + 4i, 2 - 2i

Boolean data type (bool) is a subtype of integer. It 
is a unique data type, consisting of two constants, True 
and False. Boolean True value is non-zero. Boolean 
False is the value zero.

Let us now try to execute few statements in interactive 
mode to determine the data type of the variable using 
built-in function type().
Example 3.1	

>>> quantity = 10
>>> type(quantity)
<class 'int'>

>>> Price = -1921.9
>>> type(price)
<class 'float'>

Variables of simple data types like integer, float, boolean 
etc. hold single value. But such variables are not useful 
to hold multiple data values, for example, names of the 
months in a year, names of students in a class, names 
and numbers in a phone book or the list of artefacts in a 
museum. For this, Python provides sequence data types like 
Strings, Lists, Tuples, and  mapping data type Dictionaries.
3.5.2	Sequence
A Python sequence is an ordered collection of items, 
where each item is indexed by an integer value. Three 

Reprint 2025-26

Brief Overview of Python 37

types of sequence data types available in Python are Notes
Strings, Lists and Tuples. A brief introduction to these 
data types is as follows:
(A)	 String 
String is a group of characters. These characters may be 
alphabets, digits or special characters including spaces. 
String values are enclosed either in single quotation 
marks (for example ‘Hello’) or in double quotation marks 
(for example “Hello”). The quotes are not a part of the 
string, they are used to mark the beginning and end of 
the string for the interpreter. For example,  

>>> str1 = 'Hello Friend'
>>> str2 = "452"

We cannot perform numerical operations on strings, 
even when the string contains a numeric value. For 
example str2 is a numeric string.
(B)	 List 
List is a sequence of items separated by commas and 
items are enclosed in square brackets [ ]. Note that 
items may be of different date types.

Example 3.2	
#To create a list
>>> list1 = [5, 3.4, "New Delhi", "20C", 45] 	
#print the elements of the list list1	
>>> list1     
[5, 3.4, 'New Delhi', '20C', 45]

(C)	 Tuple 
Tuple is a sequence of items separated by commas and 
items are enclosed in parenthesis ( ). This is unlike list, 
where values are enclosed in brackets [ ]. Once created, 
we cannot change items in the tuple. Similar to List, 
items may be of different data types.
Example 3.3	

#create a tuple tuple1
>>> tuple1 = (10, 20, "Apple", 3.4, 'a')    
#print the elements of the tuple tuple1
>>> print(tuple1)   
(10, 20, "Apple", 3.4, 'a')

3.5.3	Mapping
Mapping is an unordered data type in Python. Currently, 
there is only one standard mapping data type in Python 
called Dictionary.

38 Informatics Practices – Class XI

(A)	 Dictionary 
Dictionary in Python holds data items in key-value pairs 
and Items are enclosed in curly brackets { }. dictionaries 
permit faster access to data. Every key is separated from 
its value using a colon (:) sign. The key value pairs of 
a dictionary can be accessed using the key. Keys are 
usually of string type and their values can be of any data 
type. In order to access any value in the dictionary, we 
have to specify its key in square brackets [ ].
Example 3.4	

#create a dictionary
>>> dict1 = {'Fruit':'Apple', 
'Climate':'Cold', 'Price(kg)':120}   
>>> print(dict1)
{'Fruit': 'Apple', 'Climate': 'Cold', 
'Price(kg)': 120}
#getting value by specifying a key

Python compares two >>> print(dict1['Price(kg)'])
strings lexicographically 120

supports several kind of operators, their categorisation 
is briefly explained in this section.
3.6.1	Arithmetic Operators
Python supports arithmetic operators (Table 3.3) to 
perform the four basic arithmetic operations as well as 
modular division, floor division and exponentiation.

'+' operator can also be used to concatenate two 
strings on either side of the operator.

>>> str1 = "Hello"
>>> str2 = "India"
>>> str1 + str2
'HelloIndia'

'*' operator repeats the item on left side of the 
operator if first operand is a string and second operand 
is an integer value.

>>> str1 = 'India'
>>> str1 * 2
'IndiaIndia'

+ Addition Adds two numeric values on >>> num1 = 5
either side of the operator >>> num2 = 6

>>> num1 + num2
11

- Subtraction Subtracts the operand on the >>> num1 = 5
right from the operand on the left >>> num2 = 6

>>> num1 - num2
-1

* Multiplication Multiplies the two values on both >>> num1 = 5
sides of the operator >>> num2 = 6

>>> num1 * num2
30

/ Division Divides the operand on the left >>> num1 = 5
by the operand on the right of the >>> num2 = 2
operator and returns the quotient >>> num1 / num2

2.5
% Modulus Divides the operand on the left >>> num1 = 13

by the operand on the right and >>> num2 = 5
returns the remainder >>> num1 % num2

Operators (+) and (*) work in similar manner for other 
sequence data types like list and tuples. 
3.6.2	Relational Operators
Relational operator compares the values of the operands 
on its either side and determines the relationship among 
them. Conside the given Python variables num1 = 10, 
num2 = 0, num3 = 10, str1 = "Good", str2 = 
"Afternoon" for the following examples in Table 3.4:

>>> num1 != num2
If values of two operands are not True

!= Not equal to equal, then condition is True, >>> st r1 != str2
otherwise it is False True

>>> num1 != num3
False

If the value of the left operand is >>> num1 > num2

> Greater than greater than the value of the right True
operand, then condition is True,  >>> st r1 > str2
otherwise it is False. True
If the value of the left operand is 

< Less than less than the value of the right >>> num1 < num3
operand, the condition is true False
otherwise it is False

Similarly, there are other relational operators like <= 
and >=.
3.6.3	Assignment Operators
Assignment operator assigns or changes the value of 
the variable on its left, as shown in Table 3.5.

Table 3.5 Assignment operators in Python
Operator Description Example (Try in Lab)

= Assigns value from right side operand to left >>> num1 = 2
side operand >>> num2 = num1

>>> num2
2
>>> country = 'India'
>>> country
'India'

+= It adds the value of right side operand to the left >>> num1 = 10
side operand and assigns the result to the left >>> num2 = 2
side operand. >>> num1 += num2
Note: x+ = y  is same as x = x + y >>> num1

12
>>> num2
2

-= It subtracts the value of right side operand >>> num1 = 10
from the left side operand and assigns the >>> num2 = 2
result to left side operand. >>> num1 -= num2
Note: x− = y is same as x = x − y >>> num1

8

Similarly, there are other assignment operators like 
*=, /=, %=, //=, and **=.
3.6.4	Logical Operators
There are three logical operators (Table 3.6) supported 
by Python. These operators (and, or, not) are to be 
written in lower case only. The logical operator evaluates 
to either True or False based on the logical operands 
on its either side.

3.7	E xpressions 
An expression is defined as a combination of constants, 
variables and operators. An expression always evaluates 
to a value. A value or a standalone variable is also 
considered as an expression but a standalone operator 
is not an expression. Some examples of valid expressions 
are given below.
 (i) num – 20.4  (iii) 23/3 -5 * 7(14 -2)
(ii) 3.0 + 3.14   (iv) "Global"+"Citizen"

Notes 3.7.1	Precedence of Operators
So far we have seen different operators and examples 
of their usage. When an expression contains more than 
one operator, their precedence (order or hierarchy) 
determines which operator should be applied first. 
Higher precedence operator is evaluated before the 
lower precedence operator. In the following example, '*' 
and '/' have higher precedence than '+' and '-'.
Note:

a)	 Parenthesis can be used to override the precedence of 
operators. The expression within () is evaluated first.

b)	 For operators with equal precedence, the expression 
is evaluated from left to right.

Example 3.5	 How will Python evaluate the following 
expression? 

         20 + 30 * 40
       Solution:
                       #precedence of * is more than that of + 
             = 20 + 1200     	     #Step 1
             = 1220         	     #Step 2
Example 3.6	 How will Python evaluate the following 

expression? 
         (20 + 30) * 40

       Solution:
      	 = (20 + 30) * 40          	 # Step 1 
	 #using parenthesis(), we have forced  
	 precedence of + to be more than that of * 
	 = 50 * 40                          	 # Step 2
 	 = 2000                                 	 # Step 3
Example 3.7	 How will the following expression be 

evaluated?
	       15.0 / 4.0 + (8 + 3.0)

       Solution:
               	 = 15.0 / 4.0 + (8.0 + 3.0) 	 #Step 1
       	 = 15.0 / 4.0 + 11.0 	 #Step 2
  	 =  3.75 + 11.0                  	 #Step 3
           	= 14.75                	 #Step 4

3.8	 Input and Output 
Sometimes, we need to enter data or enter choices into 
a program. In Python, we have the input() function 
for taking values entered by input device such as a 
keyboard. The input() function prompts user to enter 
data. It accepts all user input (whether alphabets,

numbers or special character) as string. The syntax for Notes
input() is: 

variable = input([Prompt])
Prompt is the string we may like to display on the 

screen prior to taking the input, but it is optional. The 
input() takes exactly what is typed from the keyboard, 
converts it into a string and assigns it to the variable on 
left hand side of the assignment operator (=). 
Example 3.8	

>>> fname = input("Enter your first name: ")
Enter your first name: Arnab
>>> age = input("Enter your age: ")
Enter your age: 19

The variable fname gets the string ‘Arnab’ as input. 
Similarly, the variable age gets '19' as string. We can 
change the datatype of the string data accepted from 
user to an appropriate numeric value. For example, the 
int() function will convert the accepted string to an 
integer. If the entered string is non-numeric, an error 
will be generated.
Example 3.9	

#function int() to convert string to integer
>>> age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
Enter your age: 19
>>> type(age)
<class 'int'>

Python uses the print() function to output data 
to standard output device — the screen. The function 
print() evaluates the expression before displaying it 
on the screen. The syntax for print() is: 

print(value)

Example 3.10	
Statement Output

print("Hello") Hello
print(10*2.5) 25.0

Notes 3.9.1	Syntax Errors
Like any programming language, Python has rules that 
determine how a program is to be written. This is called 
syntax. The interpreter can interpret a statement of a 
program only if it is syntactically correct. For example, 
parentheses must be in pairs, so the expression (10 + 
12) is syntactically correct, whereas (7 + 11 is not due 
to absence of right parenthesis. If any syntax error is 
present, the interpreter shows error message(s) and 
stops the execution there. Such errors need to be 
removed before execution of the program.
3.9.2	Logical Errors 
A logical error/bug (called semantic error) does not stop 
execution but the program behaves incorrectly and 
produces undesired /wrong output. Since the program 
interprets successfully even when logical errors are 
present in it, it is sometimes difficult to identify these 
errors. 

For example, if we wish to find the average of two 
numbers 10 and 12 and we write the code as 10 + 12/2, 
it would run successfully and produce the result 16, 
which is wrong. The correct code to find the average 
should have been (10 + 12) /2 to get the output as 11.
3.9.3	Runtime Error
A runtime error causes abnormal termination of 
program while it is executing. Runtime error is when the 
statement is correct syntactically, but the interpreter 
can not execute it. 

For example, we have a statement having division 
operation in the program. By mistake, if the denominator 
value is zero then it will give a runtime error like “division 
by zero”. 

The process of identifying and removing logical 
errors and runtime errors is called debugging. We need 
to debug a program so that is can run successfully and 
generate the desired output.

3.10 Functions

A function refers to a set of statements or instructions 
grouped under a name that perform specified tasks. 
For repeated or routine tasks, we  define a function. A 
function is defined once and can be reused at multiple 

Reprint 2025-26

Brief Overview of Python 45

places in a program by simply writing the function Notes
name, i.e., by calling that function. 

Suppose we have a program which requires to 
calculate compound interest at multiple places. Now 
instead of writing the formula to calculate the interest 
every time, we can create a function called CalcCompInt 
and inside that function we write the code to take 
inputs (like interest rate, duration, principle), calculate 
interest, and display output. We can simply call the 
function by writing the function name CalcCompInt 
whenever compound interest is to be computed and 
thus reuse the code to save time and efforts. 

Python has many predefined functions called built‑in 
functions. We have already used two built-in functions 
print() and input(). A module is a python file in 
which multiple functions are grouped together. These 
functions can be easily used in a Python program by 
importing the module using import command. Use 
of built‑in functions makes programming faster and 
efficient. To use a built‑in function we must know the 
following about that function:
•	 Function Name — name of the function. 
•	 Arguments — While calling a function, we may pass 

value(s), called argument, enclosed in parenthesis, 
to the function. The function works based on these 
values. A function may or may not have argument(s).

•	 Return Value − A function may or may not return one 
or more values. A function performs operations on the 
basis of argument (s) passed to it and the result is 
passed back to the calling point. Some functions do 
not return any value. 
Let us consider the following Python program using 

three built-in functions input(), int() and print():
#Calculate square of a number
num = int(input("Enter the first number"))
square = num * num
print("the square of", num, " is ", square)  

Observe:
•	 Two built‑in functions are used in the first statement, 

int() and input(). The third line has a function 
print(). 

•	 The input function accepts an argument, “Enter your 
name”. Argument(s) is the value(s) passed within 
the parenthesis.

46 Informatics Practices – Class XI

Notes •	 Similarly the print function has four arguments "the 
square of", num, "is", square separated by 
commas.

•	 The int function in the first line takes as argument 
the value entered by the user from the keyboard and 
converts it into a string and returns it. Thus the 
return value from the int() function is an integer. 
Some of the most commonly used built‑in 

functions in Python are listed in Table 3.8 under four 
broad categories.

3.11 if..else Statements

Usually statements in a program are executed one after 
another. However, there are situations when we have 
more than one option to choose from, based on the 
outcome of certain conditions. This can be done using if..
else conditional statements. Conditional statements let 
us write program to do different tasks or take different 
paths  based on the outcome of the conditions. 

There are three ways to write if..else statements:
•	 if statement — executes the statement(s) inside if 

when the condition is true. ‘
Example 3.11	  

age = int(input("Enter your age "))

if age >= 18: # use ‘:’ to indicate end of 
condition.
    print("Eligible to vote")

conditions and execute statements accordingly. indentation.

Meaning of elif is elseif. We can also write elseif 
instead of elif for more clarity.

Example 3.12	 Check whether a number is positive, 
negative, or zero.

number = int(input("Enter a number: ")
if number > 0:
     print("Number is positive")
elif number < 0:
     print("Number is negative")
else:
     print("Number is zero")

When the conditional statements appear, the 
Python interpreter executes code inside one block that 
is selected based on the condition. Number of elif is 
dependent on the number of conditions to be checked. 
If the first condition is false, then the next condition 
is checked, and so on. If one of the conditions is true, 
then the corresponding indented block executes, and 
the if statement terminates. After that, the statements 
outside the if..else are executed or the program 
terminates if there are no further statements.

3.12 For Loop

Sometimes we need to repeat certain things for a 
particular number of times. For example, a program has 
to display attendance for every student of a class. Here 
the program has to execute the print statement for 
every student. In programming, this kind of repetition 
is called looping or iteration, and it is done using for 
statement. The for statement is used to iterate over 
a range of values or a sequence. The loop is executed 
for each item in the range. The values can be numeric, 
string, list, or tuple.

When all the items in the range are exhausted, the 
statements within loop are not executed and Python 
interpreter starts executing the statements immediately 
following the for loop. While using for loop, we should 
know in advance the number of times the loop will 
execute.

	 Syntax of the for Loop:
for <control-variable> in <sequence/items in 
range>:

	   <statements inside body of the 			 
 	   loop>

Program 3-4	 Program to 
print even 
numbers in a

for num in numbers:
     if (num % 2) == 0:
          print(num,'is an even Number')

Output:
2  is an even Number
4  is an even Number
6  is an even Number
8  is an even Number
10 is an even Number

Note: Body of the loop is indented with respect to the for statement.

3.12.1	The range() Function
The range() is a built-in function in Python. Syntax of 
range() function is:
		  range([start], stop[, step])

It is used to create a list containing a sequence of 
integers from the given start value upto stop value 
(excluding stop value), with a difference of the given 
step value. If start value is not specified, by default 
the list starts from 0. If step is also not specified, by 
default the value is incremented by 1 in each iteration. 
All parameters of range() function must be integers. The 
step parameter can be a positive or a negative integer 
excluding zero.

Example 3.13	
>>> list(range(10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

#start value is given as 2
>>>  list(range(2, 10))  
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]       

#step value is 5 and start value is 0
>>>  list(range(0, 30, 5)) 	
[0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]  	    

#step value is -1. Hence, decreasing 	
#sequence is generated
>>>  list(range(0, -9, -1)) 	
[0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8]  

The function range() is often used in for loops for 
generating a sequence of numbers.
Program 3-5	 Program to print the multiples of 10 for 

numbers in a given range.
#Program 3-5

4.1	 Introduction to List Dictionaries
The data type list is an ordered sequence which is 
mutable and made up of one or more elements. Unlike a 
string which consists of only characters, a list can have 
elements of different data types such as integer, float, 
string, tuple or even another list. A list is very useful to 
group elements of mixed data types. Elements of a list 
are enclosed in square brackets and are separated by 
comma. 
Example 4.1	  

#list1 is the list of six even numbers
>>> list1 = [2,4,6,8,10,12]
>>> print(list1)
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]

 ['Mathematics', 303]]

4.1.1	Accessing Elements in a List
Each element in list is accessed using value called index. 
The fist index value is 0, the second index is 1 and so 
on. Elements in the list are assigned index values in 
increasing order sterling from 0. 

	 To access an element, use square brackets with 
the index [] value of that element. We may also use 
negative index value to access elements starting from 
the last element in the list, having index value -0.

#initialing a list named list1 
>>> list1 = [2,4,6,8,10,12]

4.1.2	Lists are Mutable
In Python, lists are mutable. It means that the contents 
of the list can be changed after it has been created. 

#List list1 of colors 
	 >>> list1 = ['Red','Green','Blue','Orange'] 
#change/override the fourth element of list1 
	 >>> list1[3] = 'Black'               
	 >>> list1  #print the modified list list1
['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Black']

4.2	 List Operations

The data type list allows manipulation of its contents 
through various operations as shown below.
4.2.1	Concatenation
Python allows us to join two or more lists using Concatenation is the 
concatenation operator using symbol +. merging of two or 

more values. Example: 
#list1 is list of first five odd integers we can concatenate 
>>> list1 = [1,3,5,7,9]		 strings together.  
#list2 is list of first five even integers 
>>> list2 = [2,4,6,8,10]		
#Get elements of list1 followed by list2 
>>> list1 + list2           	
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
>>> list3 = ['Red','Green','Blue']
>>> list4 = ['Cyan', 'Magenta', 'Yellow' 
,'Black']
>>> list3 + list4
['Red','Green','Blue','Cyan','Magenta',   		
 'Yellow','Black']

Note that, there is no change in original lists i.e., 
list1, list2, list3, list4 remain the same after 
concatenation operation. If we want to use the result of 
two concatenated lists, we should use an assignment 
operator. 
For example, 

#Join list 2 at the end of list 
>>> new List = list 1 + list 2
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

>> new list The concatenation operator '+’ requires that 
the operands should be of list type only. If we try to 
concatenate a list with elements of some other data 
type, TypeError occurs.

Notes >>> list1 = [1,2,3]
>>> str1 = "abc"
>>> list1 + str1
TypeError: can only concatenate list (not 
"str") to list

4.2.2	Repetition
Python allows us to replicate the contents of a list using 
repetition operator depicted by symbol *.

>>> list1 = ['Hello']
#elements of list1 repeated 4 times
>>> list1 * 4			 
['Hello', 'Hello', 'Hello', 'Hello']

4.2.3	Membership
The membership operator in checks if the element 
is present in the list and returns True, else returns 
False. 

>>> list1 = ['Red','Green','Blue']
>>> 'Green' in list1
True
>>> 'Cyan' in list1
False

The Operator not in transpose returns True if the 
element is not present in the list, else it returns False.

>>> list1 = ['Red','Green','Blue']
>>> 'Cyan' not in list1
True
>>> 'Green' not in list1
False

4.2.4	Slicing
Slicing operations allow us to create new list by taking 
out elements from an existing list. 

>>> list1 =['Red','Green','Blue','Cyan', 
'Magenta','Yellow','Black']
#subject from indexes 2 to 5 of list 1
>>> list1[2:6]
['Blue', 'Cyan', 'Magenta', 'Yellow'] 

 #list1 is truncated to the end of the list
>>> list1[2:20] #second index is out of range  
['Blue', 'Cyan', 'Magenta', 'Yellow', 
'Black']
	
>>> list1[7:2] 	 #first index > second index
[] 			   #results in an empty list

#Access list in the reverse order using 
negative step size

4.3	T raversing a List

We can access each element of the list or traverse a list 
using a for loop or a while loop.
(A)	 List traversal using for loop: 

>>> list1 = ['Red','Green','Blue','Yellow',  
		     	 'Black']
>>> for item in list1:
         print(item)

 Output: len (list1) returns 
the length or total 

Red number of elements of 
Green list1.
Blue range(n) returns a 

sequence of numbers 
Yellow starting from 0, 
Black increases by 1 and ends 

Another way of accessing the elements of the list is at n-1 (one number 
using range() and len() functions: less than the specified 

number i.e. is)
>>> for i in range(len(list1)):
         print(list1[i])

Output:
Red
Green
Blue
Yellow
Black

4.4	 List Methods and Built-in Functions

The data type list has several built-in methods that 
are useful in programming. Some of them are listed in 
Table 4.1.

Table 4.1 Built-in functions for list manipulation
Method Description Example
len() Returns the length of the list passed as >>> list1 = [10,20,30,40,50]

the argument >>> len(list1)
5

list() Creates an empty list if no argument is >>> list1 = list()
passed >>> list1

[ ]

>>> str1= 'aeiou'
Creates a list if a sequence is passed as >>> list1 = list(str1)
an argument >>> list1

['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

append() Appends a single element passed as an >>> list1 = [10,20,30,40]
argument at the end of the list >>> list1.append(50)

>>> list1
A list can also be appended as an ele- [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
ment to an existing list >>> list1 = [10,20,30,40]

>>> list1.append([50,60])
>>> list1
[10, 20, 30, 40, [50, 60]]

extend() Appends each element of the list passed >>> list1 = [10,20,30]
as argument at the end of the given list >>> list2 = [40,50]

>>> list1.extend(list2)
>>> list1
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

insert() Inserts an element at a particular index >>> list1 = [10,20,30,40,50]
in the list #inserts element 25 at index value 2

>>> list1.insert(2,25)
>>> list1
[10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50]
>>> list1.insert(0,100)
>>> list1
[100, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50]

4.5	 List Manipulation    
In this chapter, we have learnt to create a list and the different ways to 
manipulate lists. In the following programs, we will apply the various list 
manipulation methods.

Program 4-1	 Write a program to allow user to perform any those list operation 
given in a menu. The menu is:

1. 	Append an element
2. 	Insert an element
3. 	Append a list to the given list
4. 	Modify an existing element
5. 	Delete an existing element from its position
6. 	Delete an existing element with a given value
7. 	Sort the list in the ascending order
8. 	Sort the list in descending order 
9. 	Display the list.

#Program 4-1
#Menu driven program to do various list operations
myList = [22,4,16,38,13] #myList having 5 elements
choice = 0
For attempt in range (3): print ("Attempt number:", attempt)
print("The list 'myList' has the following elements", myList)
print("\nL I S T   O P E R A T I O N S")
print(" 1. Append an element")
print(" 2. Insert an element at the desired position")
print(" 3. Append a list to the given list")
print(" 4. Modify an existing element")
print(" 5. Delete an existing element by its position")
print(" 6. Delete an existing element by its value")

4.6	 Introduction to Dictionaries    

The data type dictionary falls under mapping. It is a 
mapping between a set of keys and a set of values. 
The key-value pair is called an item. A key is separated 
from its value by a colon(:) and consecutive items are 
separated by commas. Items in dictionaries are ordered, 
so we will get back the data in the same order in which 
we had entered  the data initially in the dictionary.
4.6.1	Creating a Dictionary
To create a dictionary, the items entered are separated 
by commas and enclosed in curly braces. Each item is 
a key value pair, separated through colon (:). The keys 
in the dictionary must be unique and should be of any 
immutable data type i.e. number, string or tuple. The 
values can be repeated and can be of any data type.  
Example 4.2	

#dict1 is an empty dictionary
>>> dict1 = {}           
>>> dict1
{}
#dict3 is the dictionary that maps names of  
#the students to marks in percentage
>>> dict3 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}
>>> dict3
{'Mohan': 95, 'Ram': 89, 'Suhel': 92, 
'Sangeeta': 85}

4.6.2	Accessing Items in a Dictionary
We have already seen that the items of a sequence 
(string, list and tuple) are accessed using a technique 
called indexing. The items of a dictionary are accessed 
via the keys rather than via their relative positions 
or indices. Each key serves as the index and maps to 
a value.

68 Informatics Practices – Class XI

Notes The following example shows how a dictionary 
returns the value corresponding to the given key:

>>> dict3 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}
>>> dict3['Ram']          
89
>>> dict3['Sangeeta']
85
#using unspecified key
>>> dict3['Shyam']        
KeyError: 'Shyam'

In the above examples the key 'Ram' always maps to the 
value 89 and key 'Sangeeta' always maps to the value 
85. So the order of items does not matter. If the key is not 
present in the dictionary we get KeyError.

4.6.3	Membership Operation
The membership operator in checks if the key is present 
in the dictionary and returns True, else it returns False. 

>>> dict1 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}
>>> 'Suhel' in dict1
True

The not in operator returns True if the key is not 
present in the dictionary, else it returns False.

>>> dict1 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}
>>> 'Suhel' not in dict1
False

4.6.4	Dictionaries are Mutable
Dictionaries are mutable which implies that the 
contents of the dictionary can be changed after it has 
been created. 
(A)	 Adding a new item
We can add a new item to the dictionary as shown in 
the following example:

>>> dict1 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}
>>> dict1['Meena'] = 78
>>> dict1
{'Mohan': 95, 'Ram': 89, 'Suhel': 92, 
'Sangeeta': 85, 'Meena': 78}

(B)	 Modifying an existing item
The existing dictionary can be modified by just 
overwriting the key-value pair. Example to modify a 
given item in the dictionary:

>>> dict1 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}
#Marks of Suhel changed to 93.5
>>> dict1['Suhel'] = 93.5    
>>> dict1
{'Mohan': 95, 'Ram': 89, 'Suhel': 93.5, 
'Sangeeta': 85}

4.7	T raversing a Dictionary

We can access each item of the dictionary or traverse a 
dictionary using for loop. 

>>> dict1 = {'Mohan':95,'Ram':89,'Suhel':92, 
'Sangeeta':85}

Method 1:

dict() Creates a dictionary from a pair1 = [('Mohan',95),('Ram',89), 
sequence of key-value pairs ('Suhel',92),('Sangeeta',85)]

>>> pair1
[('Mohan', 95), ('Ram', 89), ('Suhel', 
92), ('Sangeeta', 85)]
>>> dict1 = dict(pair1)
>>> dict1
{'Mohan': 95, 'Ram': 89, 'Suhel': 92, 
'Sangeeta': 85}

keys() Returns a list of keys in the >>> dict1 = {'Mohan':95, 'Ram':89, 
dictionary 'Suhel':92, 'Sangeeta':85}

>>> dict1.keys()
dict_keys(['Mohan', 'Ram', 'Suhel',

4.9	 Manipulating Dictionaries

In this chapter, we have learnt how to create a 
dictionary and apply various methods to manipulate it. 
The following examples show the application of those 
manipulation methods on dictionaries.

(a)	Create a dictionary ‘ODD’ of odd numbers between 
1 and 10, where the key is the decimal number and 
the value is the corresponding number in words. 
>>> ODD = {1:'One',3:'Three',5:'Five',7:'Seven',9:'Nine'}
>>> ODD
{1: 'One', 3: 'Three', 5: 'Five', 7: 'Seven', 9: 'Nine'}

(b)	Display the keys in dictionary ‘ODD’.
>>> ODD.keys()
dict_keys([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])

(c)	Display the values in dictionary ‘ODD’.
>>> ODD.values()
dict_values(['One', 'Three', 'Five', 'Seven', 'Nine'])

(d)	Display the items from dictionary ‘ODD’
>>> ODD.items()
dict_items([(1, 'One'), (3, 'Three'), (5, 'Five'), (7, 'Seven'), (9, 
'Nine')])

(e)	Find the length of the dictionary ‘ODD’.
>>> len(ODD)
5

(f)	 Check if 7 is present or not in dictionary ‘ODD’
>>> 7 in ODD
True

Summary
•	 Lists are mutable sequences in Python, i.e. we can 

change the elements of the list.
•	 Elements of a list are put in square brackets 

separated by comma.
•	 List indexing is same as that of list and starts at 0. 

Two way indexing allows traversing the list in the 
forward as well as in the backward direction.

•	 Operator + concatenates one list to the end of other 
list.

•	 Operator * repeats the content of a list by  
specified number of times.

•	 Membership operator in tells if an element is 
present in the list or not and not in does the 
opposite.

•	 Slicing is used to extract a part of the list.
•	 There are many list manipulation methods. Few 

are: len(), list(), append(), extend(), insert(), count(), 
find(), remove(), pop(), reverse(), sort(), sorted(), 
min(), max(), sum().

•	 Dictionary is a mapping (non scalar) data type. It 
is an unordered collection of key-value pair; key-
value pair are put inside curly braces.

•	 Each key is separated from its value by a colon.
•	 Keys are unique and act as the index.
•	 Keys are of immutable type but values can be 

mutable.

•	 Collect a Bank’s application form. After careful 
analysis of the form,  identify the information 
required for opening a savings account. Also 
enquire about the rate of interest offered for a 
savings account. 

•	 The basic two operations performed on an account 
are Deposit and Withdrawal. Write a menu driven 
program that accepts either of the two choices 
of Deposit and Withdrawal, then accepts an 
amount, performs the transaction and  accordingly 
displays the balance. Remember every bank has 
a requirement of minimum balance which needs 
to be taken care of during withdrawal operations.

5.1	 Introduction to Data

Many a time, people take decisions based on 
certain data or information. For example, while 
choosing a college for getting admission, one 
looks at placement data of previous years of that 
college, educational qualification and experience 
of the faculty members, laboratory and hostel 
facilities, fees, etc. So we can say that identification 
of a college is based on various data and their 
analysis. Governments systematically collect 
and record data about the population through 
a process called census. Census data contains

valuable information which are helpful is planning and 
formulating policies. Likewise, the coaching staff of a 
sports team analyses previous performances of opponent 
teams for making strategies. Banks maintain data about 
the customers, their account details and transactions. 
All these examples highlight the need of data in various 
fields. Data are indeed crucial for decision making. 

In the previous examples, one cannot make decisions 
by looking at the data itself. In our example of choosing 
a college, suppose the placement cell of the college has 
maintained data of about 2000 students placed with 
different companies at different salary packages in the 
last 3 years. Looking at such data, one cannot make 
any remark about the placement of students of that 
college. The college processes and analyses this data 
and the results are given in the placement brochure of 
the college through summarisation as well as visuals for 
easy understanding. Hence, data need to be gathered, 
processed and analysed for making decisions. 

A knowledge base is 
a store of information In general, data is a collection of characters, numbers, 

consisting of facts, and other symbols that represents values of some 
assumptions and situations or variables. Data is plural and singular of the 
rules which an AI word data is “datum”. Using computers, data are stored 
system can use for in electronic forms because data processing becomes 
decision making. faster and easier as compared to manual data processing 

done by people. The Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) revolution led by computer, mobile and 
Internet has resulted in generation of large volume of 
data and at a very fast pace. The following list contains 
some examples of data that we often come across.
•	 Name, age, gender, contact details, etc., of a person
•	 Transactions data generated through banking, 

ticketing, shopping, etc. whether online or offline
•	 Images, graphics, animations, audio, video
•	 Documents and web pages
•	 Online posts, comments and messages 
•	 Signals generated by sensors
•	 Satellite data including meteorological data, 

communication data, earth observation data, etc.

Summary
Exercises 1.2  THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS

In earlier time scientists of different countries were using
different systems of units for measurement. Three such
systems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS
system were in use extensively till recently.

The base units for length, mass and time in these systems
were as follows :
• In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second

respectively.
• In FPS system they were foot, pound and second

respectively.
• In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second

respectively.
The system of units which is at present internationally

accepted for measurement is the Système Internationale
d’ Unites (French for International System of Units),
abbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols,
units and abbreviations, developed by the Bureau
International des Poids et measures (The International
Bureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM) in 1971 were
recently revised by the General Conference on Weights and
Measures in November 2018. The scheme is now for

international usage in scientific, technical, industrial
and commercial work.  Because SI units used decimal
system, conversions within the system are quite simple
and convenient. We shall follow the SI units in
this book.

In SI, there are seven base units as given in (a)
Table 1.1. Besides the seven base units, there are two
more units that are defined for (a) plane angle dθ as the
ratio of length of arc ds to the radius r and (b) solid
angle dΩ as the ratio of the intercepted area dA of the
spherical surface, described about the apex O as the
centre, to the square of its radius r, as shown in
Fig. 1.1(a) and (b) respectively.  The unit for plane angle

(b)
is radian with the symbol rad and the unit for the solid
angle is steradian with the symbol sr. Both these are Fig. 1.1 Description of (a) plane angle dθ and

dimensionless quantities. (b) solid angle dΩ .

quantity Name Symbol Definition

Length metre m The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the
fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299792458
when expressed in the unit m s–1, where the second is defined in terms of
the caesium frequency ∆νcs.

Mass kilogram kg The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the
fixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.62607015×10–34 when
expressed in the unit J s, which is equal to kg m2 s–1, where the metre and
the second are defined in terms of c and ∆νcs.

Time second s The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed
numerical value of the caesium frequency ∆νcs, the unperturbed ground-
state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be
9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s–1.

Electric ampere A The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by
taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be
1.602176634×10–19 when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s,
where the second is defined in terms of ∆νcs.

Thermo kelvin K The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature.
dynamic It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant
Temperature k to be 1.380649×10–23 when expressed in the unit J K–1, which is equal to

kg m2 s–2 k–1, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of
h, c and ∆νcs.

Amount of mole mol The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole
substance contains exactly 6.02214076×1023 elementary entities. This number is the

fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, N , when expressed in the
A

unit mol–1 and is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance,
symbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary
entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron,
any other particle or specified group of particles.

Luminous candela cd The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of luminous intensity in given direction.
intensity It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of

monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×1012 Hz, K , to be 683 when expressed
cd

in the unit lm W–1, which is equal to cd sr W–1, or cd sr kg–1m–2s3, where the
kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and ∆νcs.

* The values mentioned here need not be remembered or asked in a test. They are given here only to  indicate the
extent of accuracy to which they are measured. With progress in technology, the measuring techniques get
improved leading to measurements with greater precision. The definitions of base units are revised to keep up
with this progress.

10 PHYSICS

SUMMARY

1. Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities.  Certain
physical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as
length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance,
and luminous intensity).

2. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly
standardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere,
kelvin, mole and candela).  The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called
fundamental or base units.

3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a
combination of the base units and are called derived units.  A complete set of units,
both fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.

4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present
internationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.

5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and
the derived quantities obtained from them.  Certain derived units are expressed by
means of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).

6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m
for metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).

7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific
notation, with powers of 10.  Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify
measurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision
of the numbers.

8. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical
quantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for
expressing properly the physical quantities and measurements.

9. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the
relationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired
units are obtained.

10. In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained.
Rules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic
operations with them, and ‘rounding off ‘ the uncertain digits must be followed.

11. The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe
the nature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the
dimensional consistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical
quantities, etc. A dimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an
exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation
must be wrong.

kg, the unit of length equals β m, the unit of time is γ s.  Show that a calorie has a
magnitude 4.2 α –1 β –2 γ 2 in terms of the new units.

1.4 Explain this statement clearly :
“To call a dimensional quantity ‘large’ or ‘small’ is meaningless without specifying a
standard for comparison”. In view of this, reframe the following statements wherever
necessary :
(a) atoms are very small objects
(b) a jet plane moves with great speed
(c) the mass of Jupiter is very large
(d) the air inside this room contains a large number of molecules
(e) a proton is much more massive than an electron
(f) the speed of sound is much smaller than the speed of light.

is the distance between the Sun and the Earth in terms of the new unit if light takes
8 min and 20 s to cover this distance ?

1.6 Which of the following is the most precise device for measuring length :
(a) a vernier callipers with 20 divisions on the sliding scale
(b) a screw gauge of pitch 1 mm and 100 divisions on the circular scale
(c) an optical instrument that can measure length to within a wavelength of light ?

estimate on the thickness of hair ?

1.8 Answer the following :
(a)You are given a thread and a metre scale.  How will you estimate the diameter of

the thread ?
(b)A screw gauge has a pitch of 1.0 mm and 200 divisions on the circular scale. Do

you think it is possible to increase the accuracy of the screw gauge arbitrarily by
increasing the number of divisions on the circular scale ?

(c) The mean diameter of a thin brass rod is to be measured by  vernier callipers.  Why
is a set of 100 measurements of the diameter expected to yield a more reliable

Exercises learn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the
concepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine
ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight
line, also known as rectilinear motion. For the case of
rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple
equations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative
nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity.

In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as
point objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size
of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a
reasonable duration of time.  In a good number of situations
in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can
be considered as point-like objects without much error.

In Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without
going into the causes of motion. What causes motion
described in this chapter and the next chapter forms the
subject matter of Chapter 4.

2.2  INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED

The average velocity tells us how fast an object
has been moving over a given time interval but
does not tell us how fast it moves at different
instants of time during that interval.  For this,
we define instantaneous velocity or simply
velocity v at an instant t.

The velocity at an instant is defined as the
limit of the average velocity as the time interval

SUMMARY

1. An object is said to be in motion if its position changes with time.  The position of the
object can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin.  For motion in
a straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as
negative.

The average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average
velocity over a given time interval.

2. Instantaneous velocity or simply velocity is defined as the limit of the average velocity
as the time interval ∆t becomes infinitesimally small :

∆x dx
v = lim v = lim =

∆t→0 ∆t→0 ∆t dt

The velocity at a particular instant is equal to the slope of the tangent drawn on
position-time graph at that instant.

3. Average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time interval during which
the change occurs :

∆v
a =

∆t

4. Instantaneous acceleration is defined as the limit of the average acceleration as the
time interval ∆t goes to zero :

∆v dv
a = lim a = lim =

∆t→0 ∆t →0 ∆t dt

The acceleration of an object at a particular time is the slope of the velocity-time
graph at that instant of time.  For uniform motion, acceleration is zero and the x-t
graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis and the v-t graph is a straight line
parallel to the time axis. For motion with uniform acceleration, x-t graph is a parabola
while the v-t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis.

5. The area under the velocity-time curve between times t and t  is equal to the displacement

of the object during that interval of time.

6. For objects in uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion, the five quantities, displacement

POINTS TO PONDER

1. The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first specify
this choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement, velocity and acceleration.

2. If a particle is speeding up, acceleration is in the direction of velocity; if its speed is
decreasing, acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity.  This
statement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis.

3. The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle’s speed is increasing or
decreasing.  The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice
of the positive direction of the axis.  For example, if the vertically upward direction is
chosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is
negative.  If a particle is falling under gravity, this acceleration, though negative,
results in increase in speed.  For a particle thrown upward, the same negative
acceleration (of gravity) results in decrease in speed.

4. The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration
at that instant.  A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non-zero acceleration.
For example, a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost point but the
acceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to gravity.

5. In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (2.9)], the various quantities are algebraic,
i.e. they may be positive or negative.  The equations are applicable in all situations
(for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different
quantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs.

6. The definitions of instantaneous velocity and acceleration (Eqs. (2.1) and (2.3)) are
exact and are always correct while the kinematic equations (Eq. (2.9)) are true only for
motion in which the magnitude and the direction of acceleration are constant during
the course of motion.

moving disturbance is created. Similarly, when we speak,
the sound moves outward from us, without any flow of air

produced in air are much less obvious and only our ears or
a microphone can detect them. These patterns, which move
without the actual physical transfer or flow of matter as a
whole, are called waves. In this Chapter, we will study such
waves.

Waves transport energy and the pattern of disturbance has

In solids, similar arguments can be made. In
a crystalline solid, atoms or group of atoms are
arranged in a periodic lattice. In these, each
atom or group of atoms is in equilibrium, due to
forces from the surrounding atoms. Displacing
one atom, keeping the others fixed, leads to
restoring forces, exactly as in a spring. So we
can think of atoms in a lattice as end points,
with springs between pairs of them.

of the wave, usually denoted by λ. For simplicity,
we can choose points of the same phase to be

troughs in a wave. Taking  φ = 0 in Eq. (14.2),

SUMMARY

1. Mechanical waves can exist in material media and are governed by Newton’s Laws.

2. Transverse waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular
to the direction of wave propagation.

3. Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate along the
direction of wave propagation.

4. Progressive wave is a wave that moves from one point of medium to another.

5. The displacement in a sinusoidal wave propagating in the positive x direction is given
by

y (x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt + φ)

where a is the amplitude of the wave, k is the angular wave number, ω is the angular
frequency, (kx – ωt + φ) is the phase, and φ is the phase constant or phase angle.

6. Wavelength λ of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of
the same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave, it is twice the distance between
two  consecutive nodes or antinodes.

7. Period T of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium
takes to move through one complete oscillation. It is related to the angular frequency ω
through the relation

2π
T =

ω
8. Frequency v of a wave is defined as 1/T and is related to angular frequency by

ν = ω

9. Speed of a progressive wave is given by ω λ

12. When two or more waves traverse simultaneously in the same medium, the
displacement of any element of the medium is the algebraic sum of the displacements
due to each wave. This is known as the principle of superposition of waves

n

y = ∑ f i (x  −  vt )
i =1

13. Two sinusoidal waves on the same string exhibit interference, adding or cancelling
according to the principle of superposition. If the two are travelling in the same
direction and have the same amplitude a and frequency but differ in phase by a phase
constant φ, the result is a single wave with the same frequency ω :

y (x, t)  =  1  
2  − + 1 

 a cos φ  sin kx ωt φ
  2  2

If φ = 0 or an integral multiple of 2π, the waves are exactly in phase and the interference
is constructive; if φ = π, they are exactly out of phase and the interference is destructive.

14. A travelling wave, at a rigid boundary or a closed end, is reflected with a phase
reversal but the reflection at an open boundary takes place without any phase change.

For an incident wave

                           y (x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt )
i 

the reflected wave at a rigid boundary is

                         y (x, t) = – a sin (kx + ωt )
r 

For reflection at an open boundary

                       y (x,t ) = a sin (kx + ωt)
r 

15. The interference of two identical waves moving in opposite directions produces standing
waves. For a string with fixed ends, the standing wave is given by

y (x, t) = [2a sin kx ] cos ωt

Standing waves are characterised by fixed locations of zero displacement called nodes
and fixed locations of maximum displacements called antinodes. The separation
between two consecutive nodes or antinodes is λ/2.

A stretched string of length L fixed at both the ends vibrates with frequencies given by

n v
v  = ,      n = 1, 2, 3, ...

2 L

The set of frequencies given by the above relation are called the normal modes of
oscillation of the system. The oscillation mode with lowest frequency is called the
fundamental mode or the first harmonic. The second harmonic is the oscillation mode
with n = 2 and so on.

A pipe of length L with one end closed and other end open (such as air columns)
vibrates with frequencies given by

v
v = (n + ½)  ,       n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

2L
The set of frequencies represented by the above relation are the normal modes of
oscillation of such a system. The lowest frequency given by v/4L is the fundamental
mode or the first harmonic.

16. A string of length L fixed at both ends or an air column closed at one end and open
at the other end or open at both the ends, vibrates with certain frequencies called
their normal modes. Each of these frequencies is a resonant frequency of the system.

comparable amplitudes, are superposed. The beat frequency is

POINTS TO PONDER

1. A wave is not motion of matter as a whole in a medium.  A wind is different from the
sound wave in air.  The former involves motion of air from one place to the other.  The
latter involves compressions and rarefactions of layers of air.

2. In a wave, energy and not the matter is transferred from one point to the other.

3. In a mechanical wave, energy transfer takes place because of the coupling through
elastic forces between neighbouring oscillating parts of the medium.

4. Transverse waves can propagate only in medium with shear modulus of elasticity,
Longitudinal waves need bulk modulus of elasticity and are therefore, possible in all
media, solids, liquids and gases.

5. In a harmonic progressive wave of a given frequency, all particles have the same
amplitude but different phases at a given instant of time.  In a stationary wave, all
particles between two nodes have the same phase at a given instant but have different
amplitudes.

6. Relative to an observer at rest in a medium the speed of a mechanical wave in that
medium (v) depends only on elastic and other properties (such as mass density) of
the medium. It does not depend on the velocity of the source.

Exercises 1.2  THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS

In earlier time scientists of different countries were using
different systems of units for measurement. Three such
systems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS
system were in use extensively till recently.

The base units for length, mass and time in these systems
were as follows :
• In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second

respectively.
• In FPS system they were foot, pound and second

respectively.
• In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second

respectively.
The system of units which is at present internationally

accepted for measurement is the Système Internationale
d’ Unites (French for International System of Units),
abbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols,
units and abbreviations, developed by the Bureau
International des Poids et measures (The International
Bureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM) in 1971 were
recently revised by the General Conference on Weights and
Measures in November 2018. The scheme is now for

and commercial work.  Because SI units used decimal
system, conversions within the system are quite simple
and convenient. We shall follow the SI units in
this book.

In SI, there are seven base units as given in (a)
Table 1.1. Besides the seven base units, there are two
more units that are defined for (a) plane angle dθ as the
ratio of length of arc ds to the radius r and (b) solid
angle dΩ as the ratio of the intercepted area dA of the
spherical surface, described about the apex O as the
centre, to the square of its radius r, as shown in
Fig. 1.1(a) and (b) respectively.  The unit for plane angle

(b)
is radian with the symbol rad and the unit for the solid
angle is steradian with the symbol sr. Both these are Fig. 1.1 Description of (a) plane angle dθ and

dimensionless quantities. (b) solid angle dΩ .

quantity Name Symbol Definition

Length metre m The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the
fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299792458
when expressed in the unit m s–1, where the second is defined in terms of
the caesium frequency ∆νcs.

Mass kilogram kg The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the
fixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.62607015×10–34 when
expressed in the unit J s, which is equal to kg m2 s–1, where the metre and
the second are defined in terms of c and ∆νcs.

Time second s The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed
numerical value of the caesium frequency ∆νcs, the unperturbed ground-
state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be
9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s–1.

Electric ampere A The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by
taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be
1.602176634×10–19 when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s,
where the second is defined in terms of ∆νcs.

Thermo kelvin K The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature.
dynamic It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant
Temperature k to be 1.380649×10–23 when expressed in the unit J K–1, which is equal to

kg m2 s–2 k–1, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of
h, c and ∆νcs.

Amount of mole mol The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole
substance contains exactly 6.02214076×1023 elementary entities. This number is the

fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, N , when expressed in the
A

unit mol–1 and is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance,
symbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary
entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron,
any other particle or specified group of particles.

Luminous candela cd The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of luminous intensity in given direction.
intensity It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of

monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×1012 Hz, K , to be 683 when expressed
cd

kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and ∆νcs.

* The values mentioned here need not be remembered or asked in a test. They are given here only to  indicate the
extent of accuracy to which they are measured. With progress in technology, the measuring techniques get
improved leading to measurements with greater precision. The definitions of base units are revised to keep up
with this progress.

10 PHYSICS

SUMMARY

1. Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities.  Certain
physical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as
length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance,
and luminous intensity).

2. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly
standardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere,
kelvin, mole and candela).  The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called
fundamental or base units.

3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a
combination of the base units and are called derived units.  A complete set of units,
both fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.

4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present
internationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.

5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and
the derived quantities obtained from them.  Certain derived units are expressed by
means of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).

6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m
for metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).

7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific
notation, with powers of 10.  Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify
measurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision
of the numbers.

8. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical
quantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for
expressing properly the physical quantities and measurements.

9. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the
relationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired
units are obtained.

10. In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained.
Rules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic
operations with them, and ‘rounding off ‘ the uncertain digits must be followed.

11. The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe
the nature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the
dimensional consistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical
quantities, etc. A dimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an
exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation
must be wrong.

you think it is possible to increase the accuracy of the screw gauge arbitrarily by
increasing the number of divisions on the circular scale ?

is a set of 100 measurements of the diameter expected to yield a more reliable
estimate than a set of 5 measurements only ?

Exercises learn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the
concepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine
ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight
line, also known as rectilinear motion. For the case of
rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple
equations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative
nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity.

In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as
point objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size
of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a
reasonable duration of time.  In a good number of situations
in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can
be considered as point-like objects without much error.

In Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without
going into the causes of motion. What causes motion

2.2  INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED

The average velocity tells us how fast an object
has been moving over a given time interval but
does not tell us how fast it moves at different
instants of time during that interval.  For this,
we define instantaneous velocity or simply
velocity v at an instant t.

The velocity at an instant is defined as the
limit of the average velocity as the time interval

SUMMARY

1. An object is said to be in motion if its position changes with time.  The position of the
object can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin.  For motion in
a straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as
negative.

The average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average
velocity over a given time interval.

2. Instantaneous velocity or simply velocity is defined as the limit of the average velocity
as the time interval ∆t becomes infinitesimally small :

∆x dx
v = lim v = lim =

∆t→0 ∆t→0 ∆t dt

The velocity at a particular instant is equal to the slope of the tangent drawn on
position-time graph at that instant.

3. Average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time interval during which
the change occurs :

∆v
a =

∆t

4. Instantaneous acceleration is defined as the limit of the average acceleration as the
time interval ∆t goes to zero :

∆v dv
a = lim a = lim =

∆t→0 ∆t →0 ∆t dt

The acceleration of an object at a particular time is the slope of the velocity-time
graph at that instant of time.  For uniform motion, acceleration is zero and the x-t
graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis and the v-t graph is a straight line
parallel to the time axis. For motion with uniform acceleration, x-t graph is a parabola
while the v-t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis.

5. The area under the velocity-time curve between times t and t  is equal to the displacement
1 2

of the object during that interval of time.

6. For objects in uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion, the five quantities, displacement

POINTS TO PONDER

1. The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first specify
this choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement, velocity and acceleration.

2. If a particle is speeding up, acceleration is in the direction of velocity; if its speed is
decreasing, acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity.  This
statement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis.

3. The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle’s speed is increasing or
decreasing.  The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice
of the positive direction of the axis.  For example, if the vertically upward direction is
chosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is
negative.  If a particle is falling under gravity, this acceleration, though negative,
results in increase in speed.  For a particle thrown upward, the same negative
acceleration (of gravity) results in decrease in speed.

4. The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration
at that instant.  A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non-zero acceleration.
For example, a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost point but the
acceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to gravity.

5. In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (2.9)], the various quantities are algebraic,
i.e. they may be positive or negative.  The equations are applicable in all situations
(for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different
quantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs.

6. The definitions of instantaneous velocity and acceleration (Eqs. (2.1) and (2.3)) are
exact and are always correct while the kinematic equations (Eq. (2.9)) are true only for
motion in which the magnitude and the direction of acceleration are constant during
the course of motion.

In solids, similar arguments can be made. In
a crystalline solid, atoms or group of atoms are
arranged in a periodic lattice. In these, each
atom or group of atoms is in equilibrium, due to
forces from the surrounding atoms. Displacing
one atom, keeping the others fixed, leads to
restoring forces, exactly as in a spring. So we

SUMMARY

1. Mechanical waves can exist in material media and are governed by Newton’s Laws.

2. Transverse waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular
to the direction of wave propagation.

3. Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate along the
direction of wave propagation.

4. Progressive wave is a wave that moves from one point of medium to another.

5. The displacement in a sinusoidal wave propagating in the positive x direction is given
by

y (x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt + φ)

where a is the amplitude of the wave, k is the angular wave number, ω is the angular
frequency, (kx – ωt + φ) is the phase, and φ is the phase constant or phase angle.

6. Wavelength λ of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of
the same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave, it is twice the distance between
two  consecutive nodes or antinodes.

7. Period T of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium
takes to move through one complete oscillation. It is related to the angular frequency ω
through the relation

2π
T =

ω
8. Frequency v of a wave is defined as 1/T and is related to angular frequency by

12. When two or more waves traverse simultaneously in the same medium, the
displacement of any element of the medium is the algebraic sum of the displacements
due to each wave. This is known as the principle of superposition of waves

n

y = ∑ f i (x  −  vt )
i =1

13. Two sinusoidal waves on the same string exhibit interference, adding or cancelling
according to the principle of superposition. If the two are travelling in the same
direction and have the same amplitude a and frequency but differ in phase by a phase
constant φ, the result is a single wave with the same frequency ω :

y (x, t)  =  1  
2  − + 1 

 a cos φ  sin kx ωt φ
  2  2

If φ = 0 or an integral multiple of 2π, the waves are exactly in phase and the interference
is constructive; if φ = π, they are exactly out of phase and the interference is destructive.

14. A travelling wave, at a rigid boundary or a closed end, is reflected with a phase
reversal but the reflection at an open boundary takes place without any phase change.

For an incident wave

                           y (x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt )
i 

the reflected wave at a rigid boundary is

                         y (x, t) = – a sin (kx + ωt )
r 

For reflection at an open boundary

                       y (x,t ) = a sin (kx + ωt)
r 

15. The interference of two identical waves moving in opposite directions produces standing
waves. For a string with fixed ends, the standing wave is given by

y (x, t) = [2a sin kx ] cos ωt

Standing waves are characterised by fixed locations of zero displacement called nodes
and fixed locations of maximum displacements called antinodes. The separation
between two consecutive nodes or antinodes is λ/2.

A stretched string of length L fixed at both the ends vibrates with frequencies given by

The set of frequencies given by the above relation are called the normal modes of
oscillation of the system. The oscillation mode with lowest frequency is called the
fundamental mode or the first harmonic. The second harmonic is the oscillation mode
with n = 2 and so on.

A pipe of length L with one end closed and other end open (such as air columns)

at the other end or open at both the ends, vibrates with certain frequencies called

POINTS TO PONDER

1. A wave is not motion of matter as a whole in a medium.  A wind is different from the
sound wave in air.  The former involves motion of air from one place to the other.  The
latter involves compressions and rarefactions of layers of air.

2. In a wave, energy and not the matter is transferred from one point to the other.

3. In a mechanical wave, energy transfer takes place because of the coupling through
elastic forces between neighbouring oscillating parts of the medium.

4. Transverse waves can propagate only in medium with shear modulus of elasticity,
Longitudinal waves need bulk modulus of elasticity and are therefore, possible in all
media, solids, liquids and gases.

5. In a harmonic progressive wave of a given frequency, all particles have the same
amplitude but different phases at a given instant of time.  In a stationary wave, all
particles between two nodes have the same phase at a given instant but have different
amplitudes.

6. Relative to an observer at rest in a medium the speed of a mechanical wave in that
medium (v) depends only on elastic and other properties (such as mass density) of
the medium. It does not depend on the velocity of the source.

sound in steel?

14.17 A pipe 20 cm long is closed at one end. Which harmonic mode of the pipe is
resonantly excited by a 430 Hz source ? Will the same source be in resonance with
the pipe if both ends are open? (speed of sound in air is 340 m s–1).

14.18 Two sitar strings A and B playing the note ‘Ga’ are slightly out of tune and produce
beats of frequency 6 Hz. The tension in the string A is slightly reduced and the
beat  frequency is found to reduce to 3 Hz. If the original frequency of A is 324 Hz,
what is the frequency of B?

14.19 Explain why (or how):

(a) in a sound wave, a displacement node is a pressure antinode and vice versa,

(b) bats can ascertain distances, directions, nature, and sizes of the obstacles
without any “eyes”,

(c) a violin note and sitar note may have the same frequency, yet we can
distinguish between the two notes,

(d) solids can support both longitudinal and transverse waves, but only
longitudinal waves can propagate in gases, and

(e) the shape of a pulse gets distorted during propagation in a dispersive medium.

Summary
Exercises 1.2  THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS

In earlier time scientists of different countries were using
different systems of units for measurement. Three such
systems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS
system were in use extensively till recently.

The base units for length, mass and time in these systems
were as follows :
• In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second

respectively.
• In FPS system they were foot, pound and second

respectively.
• In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second

respectively.
The system of units which is at present internationally

accepted for measurement is the Système Internationale
d’ Unites (French for International System of Units),
abbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols,
units and abbreviations, developed by the Bureau
International des Poids et measures (The International
Bureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM) in 1971 were
recently revised by the General Conference on Weights and
Measures in November 2018. The scheme is now for

international usage in scientific, technical, industrial
and commercial work.  Because SI units used decimal
system, conversions within the system are quite simple
and convenient. We shall follow the SI units in
this book.

In SI, there are seven base units as given in (a)
Table 1.1. Besides the seven base units, there are two
more units that are defined for (a) plane angle dθ as the
ratio of length of arc ds to the radius r and (b) solid
angle dΩ as the ratio of the intercepted area dA of the
spherical surface, described about the apex O as the
centre, to the square of its radius r, as shown in
Fig. 1.1(a) and (b) respectively.  The unit for plane angle

(b)
is radian with the symbol rad and the unit for the solid
angle is steradian with the symbol sr. Both these are Fig. 1.1 Description of (a) plane angle dθ and

dimensionless quantities. (b) solid angle dΩ .

quantity Name Symbol Definition

Length metre m The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the
fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299792458
when expressed in the unit m s–1, where the second is defined in terms of
the caesium frequency ∆νcs.

Mass kilogram kg The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the
fixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.62607015×10–34 when
expressed in the unit J s, which is equal to kg m2 s–1, where the metre and
the second are defined in terms of c and ∆νcs.

Time second s The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed
numerical value of the caesium frequency ∆νcs, the unperturbed ground-
state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be
9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s–1.

Electric ampere A The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by
taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be
1.602176634×10–19 when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s,
where the second is defined in terms of ∆νcs.

Thermo kelvin K The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature.
dynamic It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant
Temperature k to be 1.380649×10–23 when expressed in the unit J K–1, which is equal to

kg m2 s–2 k–1, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of
h, c and ∆νcs.

Amount of mole mol The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole
substance contains exactly 6.02214076×1023 elementary entities. This number is the

fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, N , when expressed in the
A

unit mol–1 and is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance,
symbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary
entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron,
any other particle or specified group of particles.

Luminous candela cd The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of luminous intensity in given direction.
intensity It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of

monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×1012 Hz, K , to be 683 when expressed

kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and ∆νcs.

* The values mentioned here need not be remembered or asked in a test. They are given here only to  indicate the
extent of accuracy to which they are measured. With progress in technology, the measuring techniques get
improved leading to measurements with greater precision. The definitions of base units are revised to keep up
with this progress.

10 PHYSICS

SUMMARY

1. Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities.  Certain
physical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as
length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance,
and luminous intensity).

2. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly
standardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere,
kelvin, mole and candela).  The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called
fundamental or base units.

3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a
combination of the base units and are called derived units.  A complete set of units,
both fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.

4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present
internationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.

5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and
the derived quantities obtained from them.  Certain derived units are expressed by
means of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).

6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m
for metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).

7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific
notation, with powers of 10.  Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify
measurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision
of the numbers.

8. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical
quantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for
expressing properly the physical quantities and measurements.

9. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the
relationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired
units are obtained.

10. In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained.
Rules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic
operations with them, and ‘rounding off ‘ the uncertain digits must be followed.

11. The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe
the nature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the
dimensional consistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical
quantities, etc. A dimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an
exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation
must be wrong.

you think it is possible to increase the accuracy of the screw gauge arbitrarily by

Exercises learn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the
concepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine
ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight
line, also known as rectilinear motion. For the case of
rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple
equations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative
nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity.

In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as
point objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size
of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a
reasonable duration of time.  In a good number of situations
in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can
be considered as point-like objects without much error.

In Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without
going into the causes of motion. What causes motion

2.2  INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED

The average velocity tells us how fast an object
has been moving over a given time interval but
does not tell us how fast it moves at different
instants of time during that interval.  For this,
we define instantaneous velocity or simply
velocity v at an instant t.

SUMMARY

1. An object is said to be in motion if its position changes with time.  The position of the
object can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin.  For motion in
a straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as
negative.

The average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average
velocity over a given time interval.

2. Instantaneous velocity or simply velocity is defined as the limit of the average velocity
as the time interval ∆t becomes infinitesimally small :

∆x dx
v = lim v = lim =

∆t→0 ∆t→0 ∆t dt

The velocity at a particular instant is equal to the slope of the tangent drawn on
position-time graph at that instant.

3. Average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time interval during which
the change occurs :

∆v
a =

∆t

4. Instantaneous acceleration is defined as the limit of the average acceleration as the
time interval ∆t goes to zero :

∆v dv
a = lim a = lim =

∆t→0 ∆t →0 ∆t dt

The acceleration of an object at a particular time is the slope of the velocity-time
graph at that instant of time.  For uniform motion, acceleration is zero and the x-t
graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis and the v-t graph is a straight line
parallel to the time axis. For motion with uniform acceleration, x-t graph is a parabola
while the v-t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis.

5. The area under the velocity-time curve between times t and t  is equal to the displacement
1 2

of the object during that interval of time.

6. For objects in uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion, the five quantities, displacement

POINTS TO PONDER

1. The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first specify
this choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement, velocity and acceleration.

2. If a particle is speeding up, acceleration is in the direction of velocity; if its speed is
decreasing, acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity.  This
statement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis.

3. The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle’s speed is increasing or
decreasing.  The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice
of the positive direction of the axis.  For example, if the vertically upward direction is
chosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is
negative.  If a particle is falling under gravity, this acceleration, though negative,
results in increase in speed.  For a particle thrown upward, the same negative
acceleration (of gravity) results in decrease in speed.

4. The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration
at that instant.  A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non-zero acceleration.
For example, a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost point but the
acceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to gravity.

5. In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (2.9)], the various quantities are algebraic,
i.e. they may be positive or negative.  The equations are applicable in all situations
(for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different
quantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs.

6. The definitions of instantaneous velocity and acceleration (Eqs. (2.1) and (2.3)) are
exact and are always correct while the kinematic equations (Eq. (2.9)) are true only for
motion in which the magnitude and the direction of acceleration are constant during
the course of motion.

In solids, similar arguments can be made. In
a crystalline solid, atoms or group of atoms are
arranged in a periodic lattice. In these, each
atom or group of atoms is in equilibrium, due to
forces from the surrounding atoms. Displacing
one atom, keeping the others fixed, leads to
restoring forces, exactly as in a spring. So we
can think of atoms in a lattice as end points,
with springs between pairs of them.

SUMMARY

1. Mechanical waves can exist in material media and are governed by Newton’s Laws.

2. Transverse waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular
to the direction of wave propagation.

3. Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate along the
direction of wave propagation.

4. Progressive wave is a wave that moves from one point of medium to another.

5. The displacement in a sinusoidal wave propagating in the positive x direction is given
by

y (x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt + φ)

where a is the amplitude of the wave, k is the angular wave number, ω is the angular
frequency, (kx – ωt + φ) is the phase, and φ is the phase constant or phase angle.

6. Wavelength λ of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of
the same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave, it is twice the distance between
two  consecutive nodes or antinodes.

7. Period T of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium
takes to move through one complete oscillation. It is related to the angular frequency ω
through the relation

2π
T =

ω
8. Frequency v of a wave is defined as 1/T and is related to angular frequency by

12. When two or more waves traverse simultaneously in the same medium, the
displacement of any element of the medium is the algebraic sum of the displacements
due to each wave. This is known as the principle of superposition of waves

n

y = ∑ f i (x  −  vt )
i =1

13. Two sinusoidal waves on the same string exhibit interference, adding or cancelling
according to the principle of superposition. If the two are travelling in the same
direction and have the same amplitude a and frequency but differ in phase by a phase
constant φ, the result is a single wave with the same frequency ω :

y (x, t)  =  1  
2  − + 1 

 a cos φ  sin kx ωt φ
  2  2

If φ = 0 or an integral multiple of 2π, the waves are exactly in phase and the interference
is constructive; if φ = π, they are exactly out of phase and the interference is destructive.

14. A travelling wave, at a rigid boundary or a closed end, is reflected with a phase
reversal but the reflection at an open boundary takes place without any phase change.

For an incident wave

                           y (x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt )
i 

the reflected wave at a rigid boundary is

                         y (x, t) = – a sin (kx + ωt )
r 

For reflection at an open boundary

                       y (x,t ) = a sin (kx + ωt)
r 

15. The interference of two identical waves moving in opposite directions produces standing
waves. For a string with fixed ends, the standing wave is given by

y (x, t) = [2a sin kx ] cos ωt

Standing waves are characterised by fixed locations of zero displacement called nodes
and fixed locations of maximum displacements called antinodes. The separation
between two consecutive nodes or antinodes is λ/2.

A stretched string of length L fixed at both the ends vibrates with frequencies given by

n v
v  = ,      n = 1, 2, 3, ...

The set of frequencies given by the above relation are called the normal modes of
oscillation of the system. The oscillation mode with lowest frequency is called the
fundamental mode or the first harmonic. The second harmonic is the oscillation mode
with n = 2 and so on.

A pipe of length L with one end closed and other end open (such as air columns)
vibrates with frequencies given by

v
v = (n + ½)  ,       n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

The set of frequencies represented by the above relation are the normal modes of
oscillation of such a system. The lowest frequency given by v/4L is the fundamental

16. A string of length L fixed at both ends or an air column closed at one end and open
at the other end or open at both the ends, vibrates with certain frequencies called

POINTS TO PONDER

1. A wave is not motion of matter as a whole in a medium.  A wind is different from the
sound wave in air.  The former involves motion of air from one place to the other.  The
latter involves compressions and rarefactions of layers of air.

2. In a wave, energy and not the matter is transferred from one point to the other.

3. In a mechanical wave, energy transfer takes place because of the coupling through
elastic forces between neighbouring oscillating parts of the medium.

4. Transverse waves can propagate only in medium with shear modulus of elasticity,
Longitudinal waves need bulk modulus of elasticity and are therefore, possible in all
media, solids, liquids and gases.

5. In a harmonic progressive wave of a given frequency, all particles have the same
amplitude but different phases at a given instant of time.  In a stationary wave, all
particles between two nodes have the same phase at a given instant but have different
amplitudes.

6. Relative to an observer at rest in a medium the speed of a mechanical wave in that
medium (v) depends only on elastic and other properties (such as mass density) of
the medium. It does not depend on the velocity of the source.

3.0 ×10–2 kg.

Answer the following :

(a) Does the function represent a travelling wave or a stationary wave?

(b) Interpret the wave as a superposition of two waves travelling in opposite
directions. What is the wavelength, frequency, and speed of each wave ?

(c) Determine the tension in the string.

14.12 (i) For the wave on a string described in Exercise 15.11, do all the points on the
string oscillate with the same (a) frequency, (b) phase, (c) amplitude? Explain
your answers. (ii) What is the amplitude of a point 0.375 m away from one end?

14.13 Given below are some functions of x and t to represent the displacement (transverse
or longitudinal) of an elastic wave. State which of these represent (i) a travelling
wave, (ii) a stationary wave or (iii) none at all:

(a) y = 2 cos (3x) sin (10t)

(b) y = 2 x −  vt  

(c) y = 3 sin (5x – 0.5t) + 4 cos (5x – 0.5t)

(d) y = cos x sin t + cos 2x sin 2t

14.14 A wire stretched between two rigid supports vibrates in its fundamental mode with
a frequency of 45 Hz. The mass of the wire is 3.5 × 10–2  kg and its linear mass density
is 4.0 × 10–2 kg m–1. What is (a) the speed of a transverse wave on the string, and
(b) the tension in the string?

14.15 A metre-long tube open at one end, with a movable piston at the other end, shows
resonance with a fixed frequency source  (a tuning fork of frequency 340 Hz) when
the tube length is 25.5 cm or 79.3 cm. Estimate the speed of sound in air at the
temperature of the experiment. The edge effects may be neglected.

14.16 A steel rod 100 cm long is clamped at its middle. The fundamental frequency of
longitudinal vibrations of the rod are given to be 2.53 kHz. What is the speed of
sound in steel?

14.17 A pipe 20 cm long is closed at one end. Which harmonic mode of the pipe is
resonantly excited by a 430 Hz source ? Will the same source be in resonance with
the pipe if both ends are open? (speed of sound in air is 340 m s–1).

14.18 Two sitar strings A and B playing the note ‘Ga’ are slightly out of tune and produce
beats of frequency 6 Hz. The tension in the string A is slightly reduced and the
beat  frequency is found to reduce to 3 Hz. If the original frequency of A is 324 Hz,
what is the frequency of B?

14.19 Explain why (or how):

(a) in a sound wave, a displacement node is a pressure antinode and vice versa,

(b) bats can ascertain distances, directions, nature, and sizes of the obstacles
without any “eyes”,

(c) a violin note and sitar note may have the same frequency, yet we can
distinguish between the two notes,

(d) solids can support both longitudinal and transverse waves, but only
longitudinal waves can propagate in gases, and

(e) the shape of a pulse gets distorted during propagation in a dispersive medium.
