Balancing a chemical equation
According to the law of conservation of mass, a balanced chemical equation has the same number of 
atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. Many chemical equations can be balanced by 
trial and error. Let us take the reactions of a few metals and non-metals with oxygen to give oxides 
		  4 Fe(s)  +  3O2(g)  → 2Fe2O3(s)		  (a) balanced equation
		  2 Mg(s)  +  O2(g)  → 2MgO(s)		  (b) balanced equation
		  P4(s)   +  O2 (g)  → P4O10(s)		  (c) unbalanced equation
Equations (a) and (b) are balanced, since there are same number of metal and oxygen atoms on 
each side of the equations. However equation (c) is not balanced. In this equation, phosphorus 
atoms are balanced but not the oxygen atoms. To balance it, we must place the coefficient 5 on 
the left of oxygen on the left side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms appearing on the 
right side of the equation.
		  P4(s)  +  5O2(g)  → P4O10(s)		  balanced equation          
Now, let us take combustion of propane, C3H8. This equation can be balanced in steps.
Step 1 Write down the correct formulas of reactants and products. Here, propane and oxygen are 
reactants, and carbon dioxide and water are products.
		  C3H8(g)  +  O2(g) → CO2 (g) + H2O(l)   unbalanced equation
Step 2 Balance the number of C atoms:  Since 3 carbon atoms are in the reactant, therefore, three 
CO2 molecules are required on the right side.
	     	 C3H8 (g)  +  O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g) + H2O (l)
Step 3 Balance the number of H atoms: on the left there are 8 hydrogen atoms in the reactants 
however, each molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms, so four molecules of water will be 
required for eight hydrogen atoms on the right side.
		  C3H8  (g) +O2 (g)  → 3CO2  (g)+4H2O (l)
Step 4 Balance the number of O atoms:  There are 10 oxygen atoms on the right side (3 × 2 = 6 in 
CO2 and 4×1= 4 in water).  Therefore, five O2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10 CO2 
and 4×1= 4 in water).  Therefore, five O2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10 oxygen 
atoms.
		  C3H8 (g) +5O2   (g)  →  3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (l)
Step 5 Verify that the number of atoms of each element is balanced in the final equation. The 
equation shows three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and 10 oxygen atoms on each side.
All equations that have correct formulas for all reactants and products can be balanced. Always 
remember that subscripts in formulas of reactants and products cannot be changed to balance 
an equation.

Summary

Chemistry, as we understand it today is not a very old discipline. People in ancient India, 
already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of 
modern science. They applied the knowledge in various walks of life. 

The study of chemistry is very important as its domain encompasses every sphere 
of life. Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes 
undergone by them. All substances contain matter, which can exist in three states – 
solid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these states 
of matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties. Matter can also be classified 
into elements, compounds or mixtures. An element contains particles of only one type, 
which may be atoms or molecules. The compounds are formed where atoms of two or 
more elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other. Mixtures occur widely and many 
of the substances present around us are mixtures.

When the properties of a substance are studied, measurement is inherent. The 
quantification of properties requires a system of measurement and units in which the 
quantities are to be expressed. Many systems of measurement exist, of which the English

Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry 25

and the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however, has agreed to 
have a uniform and common system throughout the world, which is abbreviated as SI units 
(International System of Units).

Since measurements involve recording of data, which are always associated with a certain 
amount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the quantities 
is very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread over a wide 
range of 10–31 to 10+23. Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers in scientific 
notation is used. The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number of significant 
figures, in which the observations are reported. The dimensional analysis helps to express 
the measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible to interconvert 
the results from one system of units to another.

The combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination 
— these being the Law of Conservation of Mass, Law of Definite Proportions, Law of 
Multiple Proportions, Gay Lussac’s Law of Gaseous Volumes and Avogadro Law. All 
these laws led to the Dalton’s atomic theory, which states that atoms are building blocks 
of matter. The atomic mass of an element is expressed relative to 12C isotope of carbon, 
which has an exact value of 12u. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element is the 
average atomic mass obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of different 
isotopes of that element. The molecular mass of a molecule is obtained by taking sum of 
the atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The molecular formula can be 
calculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present in a compound 
and its molecular mass. 

The number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are 
expressed in the terms of  Avogadro constant (6.022 × 1023). This is known as 1 mol of the 
respective particles or entities.

Chemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements and 
compounds. A balanced chemical equation provides a lot of information. The coefficients 
indicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part in a particular 
reaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called 
stoichiometry. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amount of one or more reactant(s) 
required to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice-versa. The 
amount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is expressed in number of ways, 
e.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.

WORK
In the previous few chapters we have talked
about ways of describing the motion of
objects, the cause of motion and gravitation.
Another concept that helps us understand and
interpret many natural phenomena is ‘work’.
Closely related to work are energy and power.
In this chapter we shall study these concepts.
All living beings need food. Living beings
have to perform several basic activities to
survive. We call such activities ‘life processes’.
The energy for these processes comes from
food. We need energy for other activities like
playing, singing, reading, writing, thinking,
jumping, cycling and running. Activities that
are strenuous require more energy.
Animals too get engaged in activities. For
example, they may jump and run. They have
to fight, move away from enemies, find food
or find a safe place to live. Also, we engage
some animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull
carts or plough fields. All such activities
require energy.
Think of machines. List the machines that
you have come across. What do they need for
their working? Why do some engines require
fuel like petrol and diesel? Why do living
beings and machines need energy?

10.1 Work
What is work? There is a difference in the
way we use the term ‘work’ in day-to-day life
and the way we use it in science. To make
this point clear let us consider a few examples.

10.1.1 NOT
‘WORK’
WORKING HARD!

ENERGY
draws diagrams, organises her thoughts,
collects question papers, attends classes,
discusses problems with her friends, and
performs experiments. She expends a lot of
energy on these activities. In common
parlance, she is ‘working hard’. All this ‘hard
work’ may involve very little ‘work’ if we go by
the scientific definition of work.
You are working hard to push a huge rock.
Let us say the rock does not move despite all
the effort. You get completely exhausted.
However, you have not done any work on the
rock as there is no displacement of the rock.
You stand still for a few minutes with a
heavy load on your head. You get tired. You
have exerted yourself and have spent quite a
bit of your energy. Are you doing work on the
load? The way we understand the term ‘work’
in science, work is not done.
You climb up the steps of a staircase and
reach the second floor of a building just to
see the landscape from there. You may even
climb up a tall tree. If we apply the scientific
definition, these activities involve a lot of work.
In day-to-day life, we consider any useful
physical or mental labour as work. Activities
like playing in a field, talking with friends,
humming a tune, watching a movie, attending
a function are sometimes not considered to
be work. What constitutes ‘work’ depends
on the way we define it. We use and define
the term work differently in science. To
understand this let us do the following
activities:

Activity _____________ 10.3
in day-to-day life. For each of these
activities, ask the following questions
and answer them:
(i) What is the work being done on?
(ii) What is happening to the object?
(iii) Who (what) is doing the work?

•

10.1.2 SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTION OF WORK
To understand the way we view work and
define work from the point of view of science,
let us consider some situations:
Push a pebble lying on a surface. The
pebble moves through a distance. You exerted
a force on the pebble and the pebble got
displaced. In this situation work is done.
A girl pulls a trolley and the trolley moves
through a distance. The girl has exerted a
force on the trolley and it is displaced.
Therefore, work is done.
Lift a book through a height. To do this
you must apply a force. The book rises up.
There is a force applied on the book and the
book has moved. Hence, work is done.
A closer look at the above situations
reveals that two conditions need to be
satisfied for work to be done: (i) a force should
act on an object, and (ii) the object must be
displaced.
If any one of the above conditions does
not exist, work is not done. This is the way
we view work in science.
A bullock is pulling a cart. The cart
moves. There is a force on the cart and the
cart has moved. Do you think that work is
done in this situation?

•
•
Think of situations when the object
is not displaced in spite of a force
acting on it.
Also think of situations when an object
gets displaced in the absence of a force
acting on it.
List all the situations that you can
think of for each.
Discuss with your friends whether
work is done in these situations.

10.1.3 W ORK
DONE BY A CONSTANT
FORCE
How is work defined in science? T o
understand this, we shall first consider the
case when the force is acting in the direction
of displacement.
Let a constant force, F act on an object.
Let the object be displaced through a
distance, s in the direction of the force (Fig.
10.1). Let W be the work done. We define work
to be equal to the product of the force and
displacement.
Work done = force × displacement
W = Fs
(10.1)
Activity _____________ 10.2
•

•
•
•
Think of some situations from your
daily life involving work.
List them.
Discuss with your friends whether
work is being done in each situation.
Try to reason out your response.
If work is done, which is the force acting
on the object?
What is the object on which the work
is done?
What happens to the object on which
work is done?

Fig. 10.1
Thus, work done by a force acting on an
object is equal to the magnitude of the force
multiplied by the distance moved in the
direction of the force. Work has only
magnitude and no direction.
In Eq. (10.1), if F = 1 N and s = 1 m then
the work done by the force will be 1 N m.
Here the unit of work is newton metre (N m)
or joule (J). Thus 1 J is the amount of work
SCIENCE

Reprint 2025-26
done on an object when a force of 1 N
displaces it by 1 m along the line of action of
the force.
Look at Eq. (10.1) carefully. What is the
work done when the force on the object is
zero? What would be the work done when
the displacement of the object is zero? Refer
to the conditions that are to be satisfied to
say that work is done.
Example 10.1 A force of 5 N is acting on
an object. The object is displaced
through 2 m in the direction of the force
(Fig. 10.2). If the force acts on the object
all through the displacement, then work
done is 5 N × 2 m =10 N m or 10 J.

Fig. 10.2
Q
uestion
•
1. A force of 7 N acts on an object.
The displacement is, say 8 m, in
the direction of the force
(Fig. 10.3). Let us take it that the
force acts on the object through
the displacement. What is the
work done in this case?

•
•
•
Lift an object up. Work is done by the
force exerted by you on the object. The
object moves upwards. The force you
exerted is in the direction of
displacement. However, there is the
force of gravity acting on the object.
Which one of these forces is doing
positive work?
Which one is doing negative work?
Give reasons.

Work done is negative when the force acts
opposite to the direction of displacement.
Work done is positive when the force is in the
direction of displacement.

Consider another situation in which the
force and the displacement are in the same
direction: a baby pulling a toy car parallel to
the ground, as shown in Fig. 10.4. The baby
has exerted a force in the direction of
displacement of the car. In this situation, the
work done will be equal to the product of the
force and displacement. In such situations,
the work done by the force is taken as positive.
AND
Consider a situation in which an object is
moving with a uniform velocity along a
particular direction. Now a retarding force, F,
is applied in the opposite direction. That is,
the angle between the two directions is 180º.
Let the object stop after a displacement s. In
such a situation, the work done by the force,
F is taken as negative and denoted by the
minus sign. The work done by the force is
F × (–s) or (–F × s).
It is clear from the above discussion that
the work done by a force can be either positive
or negative. To understand this, let us do the
following activity:

Fig. 10.4
Example 10.2 A porter lifts a luggage of
15 kg from the ground and puts it on
his head 1.5 m above the ground.
Calculate the work done by him on the
luggage.
Solution:
ENERGY
Mass of luggage, m = 15 kg and
displacement, s = 1.5 m.

Reprint 2025-26
Work done, W = F × s = mg × s
= 15 kg × 10 m s-2 × 1.5 m
= 225 kg m s-2 m
= 225 N m = 225 J
Work done is 225 J.

Q
uestions
1. When do we say that work is
done?
2. Write an expression for the work
done when a force is acting on
an object in the direction of its
displacement.
3. Define 1 J of work.
4. A pair of bullocks exerts a force
of 140 N on a plough. The field
being ploughed is 15 m long.
How much work is done in
ploughing the length of the field?

10.2 Energy
Life is impossible without energy. The demand
for energy is ever increasing. Where do we
get energy from? The Sun is the biggest
natural source of energy to us. Many of our
energy sources are derived from the Sun. We
can also get energy from the nuclei of atoms,
the interior of the earth, and the tides. Can
you think of other sources of energy?

Activity _____________ 10.5
•

•
A few sources of energy are listed
above. There are many other sources
of energy. List them.
Discuss in small groups how certain
sources of energy are due to the Sun.
Are there sources of energy which are
not due to the Sun?

raised hammer falls on a nail placed on a piece
of wood, it drives the nail into the wood. We
have also observed children winding a toy
(such as a toy car) and when the toy is placed
on the floor, it starts moving. When a balloon
is filled with air and we press it we notice a
change in its shape. As long as we press it
gently, it can come back to its original shape
when the force is withdrawn. However, if we
press the balloon hard, it can even explode
producing a blasting sound. In all these
examples, the objects acquire, through
different means, the capability of doing work.
An object having a capability to do work is
said to possess energy. The object which does
the work loses energy and the object on which
the work is done gains energy.
How does an object with energy do work?
An object that possesses energy can exert a
force on another object. When this happens,
energy is transferred from the former to the
latter. The second object may move as it
receives energy and therefore do some work.
Thus, the first object had a capacity to do
work. This implies that any object that
possesses energy can do work.
The energy possessed by an object is thus
measured in terms of its capacity of doing
work. The unit of energy is, therefore, the same
as that of work, that is, joule (J). 1 J is the
energy required to do 1 joule of work.
Sometimes a larger unit of energy called kilo
joule (kJ) is used. 1 kJ equals 1000 J.

10.2.1 FORMS OF ENERGY
The word energy is very often used in our
daily life, but in science we give it a definite
and precise meaning. Let us consider the
following examples: when a fast moving
cricket ball hits a stationary wicket, the wicket
is thrown away. Similarly, an object when
raised to a certain height gets the capability
to do work. You must have seen that when a
Luckily the world we live in provides energy in
many different forms. The various forms
include mechanical energy (potential energy
+ kinetic energy), heat energy, chemical
energy, electrical energy and light energy.
Think it over !
How do you know that some entity is a
form of energy? Discuss with your friends
and teachers.

The trolley moves forward and hits the
wooden block.
Fix a stop on the table in such a
manner that the trolley stops after
hitting the block. The block gets
displaced.
Note down the displacement of the
block. This means work is done on the
block by the trolley as the block has
gained energy.
From where does this energy come?
Repeat this activity by increasing the
mass on the pan. In which case is the
displacement more?
In which case is the work done more?
In this activity, the moving trolley does
work and hence it possesses energy.

A moving object can do work. An object
moving faster can do more work than an
identical object moving relatively slow. A
moving bullet, blowing wind, a rotating wheel,
a speeding stone can do work. How does a
bullet pierce the target? How does the wind
move the blades of a windmill? Objects in
motion possess energy. We call this energy
kinetic energy.
A falling coconut, a speeding car, a rolling
stone, a flying aircraft, flowing water, blowing
wind, a running athlete etc. possess kinetic
energy. In short, kinetic energy is the energy
possessed by an object due to its motion. The
kinetic energy of an object increases with its
speed.
How much energy is possessed by a
moving body by virtue of its motion? By
definition, we say that the kinetic energy of a
body moving with a certain velocity is equal to
the work done on it to make it acquire
that velocity.

an object in the form of an equation. Consider
an object of mass, m moving with a uniform
velocity, u. Let it now be displaced through a
distance s when a constant force, F acts on it
in the direction of its displacement. From
Eq. (10.1), the work done, W is F s. The work
done on the object will cause a change in its
velocity. Let its velocity change from u to v.
Let a be the acceleration produced.
We studied three equations of motion. The
relation connecting the initial velocity (u)

10.2.4 POTENTIAL ENERGY OF AN OBJECT
An object increases its energy when raised
through a height. This is because work is
done on it against gravity while it is being
raised. The energy present in such an object
is the gravitational potential energy.
The gravitational potential energy of an
object at a point above the ground is defined
as the work done in raising it from the ground
to that point against gravity.
It is easy to arrive at an expression for
the gravitational potential energy of an object
at a height.

The potential energy of an object at
a height depends on the ground level
or the zero level you choose. An
object in a given position can have a
certain potential energy with respect
to one level and a different value of
potential energy with respect to
another level.

More to know
AT A HEIGHT
It is useful to note that the work done by
gravity depends on the difference in vertical
heights of the initial and final positions of
the object and not on the path along which
the object is moved. Fig. 10.8 shows a case
where a block is raised from position A to B
by taking two different paths. Let the height
AB = h. In both the situations the work done
on the object is mgh.

Fig. 10.7
Fig. 10.8
Consider an object of mass, m. Let it be
raised through a height, h from the ground.
A force is required to do this. The minimum
force required to raise the object is equal to
the weight of the object, mg. The object gains
energy equal to the work done on it. Let the
work done on the object against gravity be
W. That is,
work done, W = force × displacement
= mg × h
= mgh
Since work done on the object is equal to
mgh, an energy equal to mgh units is gained
by the object. This is the potential energy (EP)
of the object.
Ep = mgh
(10.6)
Example 10.5 Find the energy possessed
by an object of mass 10 kg when it is at
a height of 6 m above the ground. Given,
g = 9.8 m s–2.
Solution:
Mass of the object, m = 10 kg,
displacement (height), h = 6 m, and
acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m s–2.
From Eq. (10.6),
Potential energy = mgh
= 10 kg × 9.8 m s–2 × 6 m
= 588 J.
The potential energy is 588 J.

10.2.6 LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
In activities 10.13 and 10.14, we learnt that
the form of energy can be changed from one
form to another. What happens to the total
energy of a system during or after the process?
Whenever energy gets transformed, the total
energy remains unchanged. This is the law of
conservation of energy. According to this law,
energy can only be converted from one form
to another; it can neither be created or
destroyed. The total energy before and after
the transformation remains the same. The law
of conservation of energy is valid
in
all situations and for all kinds of
transformations.
Consider a simple example. Let an object
of mass, m be made to fall freely from a height,
h. At the start, the potential energy is mgh and
kinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic
energy zero? It is zero because its velocity is
zero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh.
As it falls, its potential energy will change into
kinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object
at a given instant, the kinetic energy would be
½mv2. As the fall of the object continues, the
potential energy would decrease while the
kinetic energy would increase. When the object
is about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v will
be the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy
would be the largest and potential energy the
least. However, the sum of the potential energy
and kinetic energy of the object would be the
same at all points. That is,
potential energy + kinetic energy = constant
or
mgh +
1
mv 2= constant.
2
(10.7)
The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy
of an object is its total mechanical energy.
We find that during the free fall of the object,
the decrease in potential energy, at any point
in its path, appears as an equal amount of
increase in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of
air resistance on the motion of the object has
been ignored.) There is thus a continual
transformation of gravitational potential
energy into kinetic energy.

A stronger person may do certain work in
relatively less time. A more powerful vehicle
would complete a journey in a shorter time
than a less powerful one. We talk of the power
of machines like motorbikes and motorcars.
The speed with which these vehicles change
energy or do work is a basis for their
classification. Power measures the speed of
work done, that is, how fast or slow work is
done. Power is defined as the rate of doing
work or the rate of transfer of energy. If an

given by:

10.3 Rate of Doing Work
Do all of us work at the same rate? Do
machines consume or transfer energy at the
same rate? Agents that transfer energy do
work at different rates. Let us understand this

What is the work done by each?
The work done is the same. However,
A has taken less time than B to do
the work.
Who has done more work in a given
time, say in 1 s?

P=

W

(10.8)
The unit of power is watt [in honour of
James Watt (1736 – 1819)] having the symbol
W. 1 watt is the power of an agent, which
does work at the rate of 1 joule per second.
We can also say that power is 1 W when the
rate of consumption of energy is 1 J s–1.
1 watt = 1 joule/second or 1 W = 1 J s–1.
We express larger rates of energy transfer in
kilowatts (kW).
1 kilowatt = 1000 watts
1 kW
= 1000 W
1 kW
= 1000 J s–1.
The power of an agent may vary with time.
This means that the agent may be doing work
at different rates at different intervals of time.
Therefore the concept of average power is
useful. We obtain average power by dividing
the total energy consumed by the total time
taken.

N climb up a rope through a height of 8

Work done on an object is defined as the magnitude of the
force multiplied by the distance moved by the object in the
direction of the applied force. The unit of work is joule:
1 joule = 1 newton × 1 metre.

•
Work done on an object by a force would be zero if the
displacement of the object is zero.

•
An object having capability to do work is said to possess
energy. Energy has the same unit as that of work.

•
An object in motion possesses what is known as the kinetic
energy of the object. An object of mass, m moving with
1

velocity v has a kinetic energy of 2 mv .

•
The energy possessed by a body due to its change in position
or shape is called the potential energy. The gravitational
potential energy of an object of mass, m raised through a
height, h from the earth’s surface is given by m g h.

•
According to the law of conservation of energy, energy can
only be transformed from one form to another; it can neither
be created nor destroyed. The total energy before and after
the transformation always remains constant.

•
Energy exists in nature in several forms such as kinetic
energy, potential energy, heat energy, chemical energy etc.
The sum of the kinetic and potential energies of an object is
called its mechanical energy.
