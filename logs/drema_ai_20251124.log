a)	 Interactive mode 
b)	 Script mode

(A)	 Interactive Mode
In the interactive mode, we can type a Python statement 
on the >>> prompt directly. As soon as we press enter, 
the interpreter executes the statement and displays the 
result(s), as shown in Figure 3.2.

Working in the interactive mode is convenient for 
testing a single line code for instant execution. But in 
the interactive mode, we cannot save the statements for

(B)	 Script Mode
In the script mode, we can write a Python program in 
a file, save it and then use the interpreter to execute 
the program from the file. Such program files have 
a .py extension and they are also known as scripts.

program on that file and save it with a desired name. 
By default, the Python scripts are saved in the Python 
installation folder.

Notes 3.2	 Python Keywords

Keywords are reserved words. Each keyword has a 
specific meaning to the Python interpreter. As Python 
is case sensitive, keywords must be written exactly as 
given in Table 3.1.

Table 3.1 Python keywords
False class finally is return
None continue for lambda try
True def from nonlocal while
and del global not with
as elif if or yield
assert else import pass  
break except in raise  

3.3	 Identifiers
In programming languages, identifiers are names used 
to identify a variable, function, or other entities in a 
program. The rules for naming an identifier in Python 
are as follows: 
•	 The name should begin with an uppercase or a 

lowercase alphabet or an underscore sign (_). This 
may be followed by any combination of characters 
a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or underscore (_). Thus, an identifier 
cannot start with a digit.

•	 It can be of any length. (However, it is preferred to 
keep it short and meaningful). 

•	 It should not be a keyword or reserved word given in 
Table 3.1.

•	 We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, %, etc. 
in identifiers.
For example, to find the average of marks obtained 

by a student in three subjects namely Maths, English, 
Informatics Practices (IP), we can choose the identifiers 
as marksMaths, marksEnglish, marksIP and avg 
rather than a, b, c, or A, B, C, as such alphabets do not 
give any clue about the data that variable refers to.

avg = (marksMaths + marksEnglish + marksIP)/3

3.4	 Variables

Variable is an identifier whose value can change. For 
example  variable age can have  different  value for 
different person. Variable name should be unique in a 
program. Value of a variable can be string (for example,

Every value belongs to a specific data type in Python. 
Data type identifies the type of data which a variable

those data. Figure 3.6 enlists the data types available 
in Python.

Dictionaries

Figure 3.6:	Different Data Types in Python
3.5.1	Number
Number data type stores numerical values only. It is 
further classified into three different types: int, float 
and complex.

Table 3.2 Numeric data types
Type/ Class Description Examples

int integer numbers -12, -3, 0, 123, 2
float floating point numbers -2.04, 4.0, 14.23

complex complex numbers 3 + 4i, 2 - 2i

Boolean data type (bool) is a subtype of integer. It 
is a unique data type, consisting of two constants, True 
and False. Boolean True value is non-zero. Boolean 
False is the value zero.

Let us now try to execute few statements in interactive 
mode to determine the data type of the variable using 
built-in function type().
Example 3.1	

>>> quantity = 10
>>> type(quantity)
<class 'int'>

>>> Price = -1921.9
>>> type(price)
<class 'float'>

Variables of simple data types like integer, float, boolean 
etc. hold single value. But such variables are not useful 
to hold multiple data values, for example, names of the 
months in a year, names of students in a class, names 
and numbers in a phone book or the list of artefacts in a 
museum. For this, Python provides sequence data types like 
Strings, Lists, Tuples, and  mapping data type Dictionaries.
3.5.2	Sequence

where each item is indexed by an integer value. Three

Brief Overview of Python 37

types of sequence data types available in Python are Notes
Strings, Lists and Tuples. A brief introduction to these 
data types is as follows:
(A)	 String 
String is a group of characters. These characters may be 
alphabets, digits or special characters including spaces. 
String values are enclosed either in single quotation 
marks (for example ‘Hello’) or in double quotation marks 
(for example “Hello”). The quotes are not a part of the 
string, they are used to mark the beginning and end of 
the string for the interpreter. For example,  

>>> str1 = 'Hello Friend'
>>> str2 = "452"

We cannot perform numerical operations on strings, 
even when the string contains a numeric value. For 
example str2 is a numeric string.
(B)	 List 
List is a sequence of items separated by commas and 
items are enclosed in square brackets [ ]. Note that 
items may be of different date types.

Example 3.2	
#To create a list
>>> list1 = [5, 3.4, "New Delhi", "20C", 45] 	
#print the elements of the list list1	
>>> list1     
[5, 3.4, 'New Delhi', '20C', 45]

(C)	 Tuple 
Tuple is a sequence of items separated by commas and 
items are enclosed in parenthesis ( ). This is unlike list, 
where values are enclosed in brackets [ ]. Once created, 
we cannot change items in the tuple. Similar to List, 
items may be of different data types.
Example 3.3	

#create a tuple tuple1
>>> tuple1 = (10, 20, "Apple", 3.4, 'a')    
#print the elements of the tuple tuple1
>>> print(tuple1)   
(10, 20, "Apple", 3.4, 'a')

3.5.3	Mapping
Mapping is an unordered data type in Python. Currently, 
there is only one standard mapping data type in Python 
called Dictionary.

38 Informatics Practices – Class XI

(A)	 Dictionary 
Dictionary in Python holds data items in key-value pairs 
and Items are enclosed in curly brackets { }. dictionaries 
permit faster access to data. Every key is separated from 
its value using a colon (:) sign. The key value pairs of 
a dictionary can be accessed using the key. Keys are 
usually of string type and their values can be of any data 
type. In order to access any value in the dictionary, we 
have to specify its key in square brackets [ ].
Example 3.4	

#create a dictionary
>>> dict1 = {'Fruit':'Apple', 
'Climate':'Cold', 'Price(kg)':120}   
>>> print(dict1)
{'Fruit': 'Apple', 'Climate': 'Cold', 
'Price(kg)': 120}
#getting value by specifying a key

Python compares two >>> print(dict1['Price(kg)'])
strings lexicographically 120

supports several kind of operators, their categorisation 
is briefly explained in this section.
3.6.1	Arithmetic Operators
Python supports arithmetic operators (Table 3.3) to 
perform the four basic arithmetic operations as well as 
modular division, floor division and exponentiation.

'+' operator can also be used to concatenate two 
strings on either side of the operator.

>>> str1 = "Hello"
>>> str2 = "India"
>>> str1 + str2
'HelloIndia'

'*' operator repeats the item on left side of the 
operator if first operand is a string and second operand 
is an integer value.

>>> str1 = 'India'
>>> str1 * 2
'IndiaIndia'

Table 3.3 Arithmetic operators in Python
Operator Operation Description Example (Try in Lab)

+ Addition Adds two numeric values on >>> num1 = 5
either side of the operator >>> num2 = 6

>>> num1 + num2
11

- Subtraction Subtracts the operand on the >>> num1 = 5
right from the operand on the left >>> num2 = 6

>>> num1 - num2
-1

* Multiplication Multiplies the two values on both >>> num1 = 5
sides of the operator >>> num2 = 6

>>> num1 * num2
30

/ Division Divides the operand on the left >>> num1 = 5
by the operand on the right of the >>> num2 = 2
operator and returns the quotient >>> num1 / num2

2.5
% Modulus Divides the operand on the left >>> num1 = 13

by the operand on the right and >>> num2 = 5
returns the remainder >>> num1 % num2

// Floor Division Divides the operand on the left >>> num1 = 5

by the operand on the right and >>> num2 = 2
returns the quotient by removing >>> num1 // num2

Operators (+) and (*) work in similar manner for other 
sequence data types like list and tuples. 
3.6.2	Relational Operators
Relational operator compares the values of the operands 
on its either side and determines the relationship among 
them. Conside the given Python variables num1 = 10, 
num2 = 0, num3 = 10, str1 = "Good", str2 = 
"Afternoon" for the following examples in Table 3.4:

>>> num1 != num2
If values of two operands are not True

!= Not equal to equal, then condition is True, >>> st r1 != str2
otherwise it is False True

>>> num1 != num3
False

If the value of the left operand is >>> num1 > num2

> Greater than greater than the value of the right True
operand, then condition is True,  >>> st r1 > str2
otherwise it is False. True
If the value of the left operand is 

< Less than less than the value of the right >>> num1 < num3
operand, the condition is true False
otherwise it is False

Similarly, there are other relational operators like <= 
and >=.
3.6.3	Assignment Operators
Assignment operator assigns or changes the value of 
the variable on its left, as shown in Table 3.5.

Table 3.5 Assignment operators in Python
Operator Description Example (Try in Lab)

= Assigns value from right side operand to left >>> num1 = 2
side operand >>> num2 = num1

>>> num2

>>> country = 'India'
>>> country
'India'

+= It adds the value of right side operand to the left >>> num1 = 10
side operand and assigns the result to the left >>> num2 = 2
side operand. >>> num1 += num2
Note: x+ = y  is same as x = x + y >>> num1

12
>>> num2
2

-= It subtracts the value of right side operand >>> num1 = 10
from the left side operand and assigns the >>> num2 = 2
result to left side operand. >>> num1 -= num2
Note: x− = y is same as x = x − y >>> num1

8

Similarly, there are other assignment operators like 
*=, /=, %=, //=, and **=.
3.6.4	Logical Operators
There are three logical operators (Table 3.6) supported 
by Python. These operators (and, or, not) are to be 
written in lower case only. The logical operator evaluates 
to either True or False based on the logical operands 
on its either side.

Notes 3.7.1	Precedence of Operators
So far we have seen different operators and examples 
of their usage. When an expression contains more than 
one operator, their precedence (order or hierarchy) 
determines which operator should be applied first. 
Higher precedence operator is evaluated before the 
lower precedence operator. In the following example, '*' 
and '/' have higher precedence than '+' and '-'.
Note:

a)	 Parenthesis can be used to override the precedence of 
operators. The expression within () is evaluated first.

b)	 For operators with equal precedence, the expression 
is evaluated from left to right.

Example 3.5	 How will Python evaluate the following 
expression? 

         20 + 30 * 40
       Solution:
                       #precedence of * is more than that of + 
             = 20 + 1200     	     #Step 1
             = 1220         	     #Step 2
Example 3.6	 How will Python evaluate the following 

expression? 
         (20 + 30) * 40

       Solution:
      	 = (20 + 30) * 40          	 # Step 1 
	 #using parenthesis(), we have forced  
	 precedence of + to be more than that of * 
	 = 50 * 40                          	 # Step 2
 	 = 2000                                 	 # Step 3
Example 3.7	 How will the following expression be 

evaluated?
	       15.0 / 4.0 + (8 + 3.0)

       Solution:
               	 = 15.0 / 4.0 + (8.0 + 3.0) 	 #Step 1
       	 = 15.0 / 4.0 + 11.0 	 #Step 2
  	 =  3.75 + 11.0                  	 #Step 3
           	= 14.75                	 #Step 4

3.8	 Input and Output 
Sometimes, we need to enter data or enter choices into 
a program. In Python, we have the input() function 
for taking values entered by input device such as a 
keyboard. The input() function prompts user to enter 
data. It accepts all user input (whether alphabets,

numbers or special character) as string. The syntax for Notes
input() is: 

variable = input([Prompt])
Prompt is the string we may like to display on the 

screen prior to taking the input, but it is optional. The 
input() takes exactly what is typed from the keyboard, 
converts it into a string and assigns it to the variable on 
left hand side of the assignment operator (=). 
Example 3.8	

>>> fname = input("Enter your first name: ")
Enter your first name: Arnab
>>> age = input("Enter your age: ")
Enter your age: 19

The variable fname gets the string ‘Arnab’ as input. 
Similarly, the variable age gets '19' as string. We can 
change the datatype of the string data accepted from 
user to an appropriate numeric value. For example, the 
int() function will convert the accepted string to an 
integer. If the entered string is non-numeric, an error 
will be generated.
Example 3.9	

#function int() to convert string to integer
>>> age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
Enter your age: 19
>>> type(age)
<class 'int'>

Python uses the print() function to output data 
to standard output device — the screen. The function 
print() evaluates the expression before displaying it 
on the screen. The syntax for print() is: 

print(value)

Notes 3.9.1	Syntax Errors
Like any programming language, Python has rules that 
determine how a program is to be written. This is called 
syntax. The interpreter can interpret a statement of a 
program only if it is syntactically correct. For example, 
parentheses must be in pairs, so the expression (10 + 
12) is syntactically correct, whereas (7 + 11 is not due 
to absence of right parenthesis. If any syntax error is 
present, the interpreter shows error message(s) and 
stops the execution there. Such errors need to be 
removed before execution of the program.
3.9.2	Logical Errors 
A logical error/bug (called semantic error) does not stop 
execution but the program behaves incorrectly and 
produces undesired /wrong output. Since the program 
interprets successfully even when logical errors are 
present in it, it is sometimes difficult to identify these 
errors. 

For example, if we wish to find the average of two 
numbers 10 and 12 and we write the code as 10 + 12/2, 
it would run successfully and produce the result 16, 
which is wrong. The correct code to find the average 
should have been (10 + 12) /2 to get the output as 11.
3.9.3	Runtime Error
A runtime error causes abnormal termination of 
program while it is executing. Runtime error is when the 
statement is correct syntactically, but the interpreter 
can not execute it. 

For example, we have a statement having division 
operation in the program. By mistake, if the denominator 
value is zero then it will give a runtime error like “division 
by zero”. 

The process of identifying and removing logical 
errors and runtime errors is called debugging. We need 
to debug a program so that is can run successfully and 
generate the desired output.

3.10 Functions

A function refers to a set of statements or instructions 
grouped under a name that perform specified tasks. 
For repeated or routine tasks, we  define a function. A 
function is defined once and can be reused at multiple 

Reprint 2025-26

Brief Overview of Python 45

places in a program by simply writing the function Notes
name, i.e., by calling that function. 

Suppose we have a program which requires to 
calculate compound interest at multiple places. Now 
instead of writing the formula to calculate the interest 
every time, we can create a function called CalcCompInt 
and inside that function we write the code to take 
inputs (like interest rate, duration, principle), calculate 
interest, and display output. We can simply call the 
function by writing the function name CalcCompInt 
whenever compound interest is to be computed and 
thus reuse the code to save time and efforts. 

Python has many predefined functions called built‑in 
functions. We have already used two built-in functions 
print() and input(). A module is a python file in 
which multiple functions are grouped together. These 
functions can be easily used in a Python program by 
importing the module using import command. Use 
of built‑in functions makes programming faster and 
efficient. To use a built‑in function we must know the 
following about that function:
•	 Function Name — name of the function. 
•	 Arguments — While calling a function, we may pass 

value(s), called argument, enclosed in parenthesis, 
to the function. The function works based on these 
values. A function may or may not have argument(s).

•	 Return Value − A function may or may not return one 
or more values. A function performs operations on the 
basis of argument (s) passed to it and the result is 
passed back to the calling point. Some functions do 
not return any value. 
Let us consider the following Python program using 

three built-in functions input(), int() and print():
#Calculate square of a number
num = int(input("Enter the first number"))
square = num * num
print("the square of", num, " is ", square)  

Observe:
•	 Two built‑in functions are used in the first statement, 

int() and input(). The third line has a function 
print(). 

•	 The input function accepts an argument, “Enter your 
name”. Argument(s) is the value(s) passed within 
the parenthesis. 

Reprint 2025-26

46 Informatics Practices – Class XI

Notes •	 Similarly the print function has four arguments "the 
square of", num, "is", square separated by 
commas.

•	 The int function in the first line takes as argument 
the value entered by the user from the keyboard and 
converts it into a string and returns it. Thus the 
return value from the int() function is an integer. 
Some of the most commonly used built‑in 

functions in Python are listed in Table 3.8 under four 
broad categories.

3.11 if..else Statements

Usually statements in a program are executed one after 
another. However, there are situations when we have 
more than one option to choose from, based on the 
outcome of certain conditions. This can be done using if..
else conditional statements. Conditional statements let 
us write program to do different tasks or take different 
paths  based on the outcome of the conditions. 

There are three ways to write if..else statements:
•	 if statement — executes the statement(s) inside if 

when the condition is true. ‘
Example 3.11	  

age = int(input("Enter your age "))

if age >= 18: # use ‘:’ to indicate end of 
condition.
    print("Eligible to vote")

Meaning of elif is elseif. We can also write elseif 
instead of elif for more clarity.

Example 3.12	 Check whether a number is positive, 
negative, or zero.

number = int(input("Enter a number: ")
if number > 0:
     print("Number is positive")
elif number < 0:
     print("Number is negative")
else:
     print("Number is zero")

When the conditional statements appear, the 
Python interpreter executes code inside one block that 
is selected based on the condition. Number of elif is 
dependent on the number of conditions to be checked. 
If the first condition is false, then the next condition 
is checked, and so on. If one of the conditions is true, 
then the corresponding indented block executes, and 
the if statement terminates. After that, the statements 
outside the if..else are executed or the program 
terminates if there are no further statements.

3.12 For Loop

Sometimes we need to repeat certain things for a 
particular number of times. For example, a program has 
to display attendance for every student of a class. Here 
the program has to execute the print statement for 
every student. In programming, this kind of repetition 
is called looping or iteration, and it is done using for 
statement. The for statement is used to iterate over 
a range of values or a sequence. The loop is executed 
for each item in the range. The values can be numeric, 
string, list, or tuple.

When all the items in the range are exhausted, the 
statements within loop are not executed and Python 
interpreter starts executing the statements immediately 
following the for loop. While using for loop, we should 
know in advance the number of times the loop will 
execute.

	 Syntax of the for Loop:
for <control-variable> in <sequence/items in 
range>:

	   <statements inside body of the 			 
 	   loop>

Program 3-4	 Program to 
print even 
numbers in a

for num in numbers:
     if (num % 2) == 0:
          print(num,'is an even Number')

Output:
2  is an even Number
4  is an even Number
6  is an even Number
8  is an even Number
10 is an even Number

Note: Body of the loop is indented with respect to the for statement.

3.12.1	The range() Function
The range() is a built-in function in Python. Syntax of 
range() function is:
		  range([start], stop[, step])

It is used to create a list containing a sequence of 
integers from the given start value upto stop value 
(excluding stop value), with a difference of the given 
step value. If start value is not specified, by default 
the list starts from 0. If step is also not specified, by 
default the value is incremented by 1 in each iteration. 
All parameters of range() function must be integers. The 
step parameter can be a positive or a negative integer 
excluding zero.

Example 3.13	
>>> list(range(10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

#start value is given as 2
>>>  list(range(2, 10))  
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]       

#step value is 5 and start value is 0
>>>  list(range(0, 30, 5)) 	
[0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]  	    

#step value is -1. Hence, decreasing 	
#sequence is generated
>>>  list(range(0, -9, -1)) 	
[0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8]  

The function range() is often used in for loops for 
generating a sequence of numbers.
Program 3-5	 Program to print the multiples of 10 for 

numbers in a given range.
#Program 3-5

4.1	 Introduction to List Dictionaries
The data type list is an ordered sequence which is 
mutable and made up of one or more elements. Unlike a 
string which consists of only characters, a list can have 
elements of different data types such as integer, float, 
string, tuple or even another list. A list is very useful to 
group elements of mixed data types. Elements of a list 
are enclosed in square brackets and are separated by 
comma. 
Example 4.1	  

#list1 is the list of six even numbers
>>> list1 = [2,4,6,8,10,12]
>>> print(list1)
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]

 ['Mathematics', 303]]

4.1.1	Accessing Elements in a List
Each element in list is accessed using value called index. 
The fist index value is 0, the second index is 1 and so 
on. Elements in the list are assigned index values in 
increasing order sterling from 0. 

	 To access an element, use square brackets with 
the index [] value of that element. We may also use 
negative index value to access elements starting from 
the last element in the list, having index value -0.

Every value belongs to a specific data type in Python. 
Data type identifies the type of data which a variable 
can hold and the operations that can be performed on 
those data. Figure 3.6 enlists the data types available

3.10 Functions

A function refers to a set of statements or instructions 
grouped under a name that perform specified tasks. 
For repeated or routine tasks, we  define a function. A 
function is defined once and can be reused at multiple

places in a program by simply writing the function Notes
name, i.e., by calling that function. 

Suppose we have a program which requires to 
calculate compound interest at multiple places. Now 
instead of writing the formula to calculate the interest 
every time, we can create a function called CalcCompInt 
and inside that function we write the code to take 
inputs (like interest rate, duration, principle), calculate 
interest, and display output. We can simply call the 
function by writing the function name CalcCompInt 
whenever compound interest is to be computed and 
thus reuse the code to save time and efforts. 

Python has many predefined functions called built‑in 
functions. We have already used two built-in functions 
print() and input(). A module is a python file in 
which multiple functions are grouped together. These 
functions can be easily used in a Python program by 
importing the module using import command. Use 
of built‑in functions makes programming faster and 
efficient. To use a built‑in function we must know the 
following about that function:
•	 Function Name — name of the function. 
•	 Arguments — While calling a function, we may pass 

value(s), called argument, enclosed in parenthesis, 
to the function. The function works based on these 
values. A function may or may not have argument(s).

•	 Return Value − A function may or may not return one 
or more values. A function performs operations on the 
basis of argument (s) passed to it and the result is 
passed back to the calling point. Some functions do 
not return any value. 
Let us consider the following Python program using 

three built-in functions input(), int() and print():
#Calculate square of a number
num = int(input("Enter the first number"))
square = num * num
print("the square of", num, " is ", square)  

Observe:
•	 Two built‑in functions are used in the first statement, 

int() and input(). The third line has a function 
print(). 

•	 The input function accepts an argument, “Enter your 
name”. Argument(s) is the value(s) passed within 
the parenthesis.

Notes •	 Similarly the print function has four arguments "the 
square of", num, "is", square separated by 
commas.

•	 The int function in the first line takes as argument 
the value entered by the user from the keyboard and 
converts it into a string and returns it. Thus the 
return value from the int() function is an integer. 
Some of the most commonly used built‑in 

functions in Python are listed in Table 3.8 under four 
broad categories.

3.12 For Loop

Sometimes we need to repeat certain things for a 
particular number of times. For example, a program has 
to display attendance for every student of a class. Here 
the program has to execute the print statement for 
every student. In programming, this kind of repetition 
is called looping or iteration, and it is done using for 
statement. The for statement is used to iterate over 
a range of values or a sequence. The loop is executed 
for each item in the range. The values can be numeric, 
string, list, or tuple.

When all the items in the range are exhausted, the 
statements within loop are not executed and Python 
interpreter starts executing the statements immediately 
following the for loop. While using for loop, we should 
know in advance the number of times the loop will 
execute.

	 Syntax of the for Loop:
for <control-variable> in <sequence/items in 
range>:

	   <statements inside body of the 			 
 	   loop>

Program 3-4	 Program to 
print even 
numbers in a 
given sequence 
using for loop.

#Program 3-4
#Print even numbers in the given sequence
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
for num in numbers:
     if (num % 2) == 0:
          print(num,'is an even Number')

Output:
2  is an even Number
4  is an even Number
6  is an even Number
8  is an even Number
10 is an even Number

Note: Body of the loop is indented with respect to the for statement.

Summary Notes
•	 Python is an open-source, high level, interpreter-

based language that can be used for a multitude of 
scientific and non-scientific computing purposes.

•	 Comments are non-executable statements in a 
program.

•	 An identifier is a user defined name given to a 
variable or a constant in a program.

•	 Process of identifying and removing errors from a 
computer program is called debugging.

•	 Trying to use a variable that has not been assigned 
a value gives an error.

•	 There are several data types in Python — integer, 
boolean, float, complex, string, list, tuple, sets, 
None and dictionary. 

•	 Operators are constructs that manipulate the value 
of operands. Operators may be unary or binary. 

•	 An expression is a combination of values, variables, 
and operators.

•	 Python has input() function for taking user input.
•	 Python has print() function to output data to a 

standard output device.
•	 The if statement is used for decision making.
•	 Looping allows sections of code to be executed 

repeatedly under some condition. 
•	 for statement can be used to iterate over a range 

of values or a sequence. 
•	 The statements within the body of for loop are 

executed till the range of values is exhausted.

1.	 Which of the following identifier names are invalid and 

why?    
a) Serial_no. e) Total_Marks

Why Newspapers?
Krishnaji Trimbuck Ranade inhabitant of Poona intends to publish a Newspaper in
the Marathi Language with a view of affording useful information on every topic of
local interest. It will be open for free discussion on subjects of general utility, scientific
investigation and the speculations connected with the antiquities, statistics,
curiosities, history and geography of the country and of the Deccan especially... the
patronage and support of all interested in the diffusion of knowledge and Welfare of
the People is earnestly solicited.
Bombay Telegraph and Courier, 6 January 1849

"The task of the native newspapers and political associations is identical to the role
of the Opposition in the House of Commons in Parliament in England. That is to
critically examine government policy to suggest improvements, by removing those
parts that will not be to the benefit of the people, and also by ensuring speedy
implementation.
These associations ought to carefully study the particular issues, gather diverse
relevant information on the nation as well as on what are the possible and desirable
improvements, and this will surely earn it considerable influence”.

Global pollution is rising due to rapid economic growth, population increases, and
insufficient environmental management. This poses serious health risks for people
and ecosystems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Contributing to
these challenges, the global economy relies on deeply intertwined supply chains,
sustained by more than 100 billion tons of raw materials entering the system each
year. Intensive material consumption depletes natural resources and causes
negative environmental impacts at every stage of the product lifecycle. Global waste
is expected to increase to 3.4 billion tons by 2050.
Pollution of all types hinders development outcomes. Exposure to air pollution, water
pollution, and hazardous chemicals and wastes like mercury, lead and persistent
organic pollutants (POPs) causes debilitating and fatal illnesses, creates harmful
living conditions, and destroys ecosystems. Pollution undermines sustainable
economic growth, exacerbates poverty and inequality in both urban and rural areas,
and significantly contributes to climate change. Poor people, who cannot afford to
protect themselves from the negative impacts of pollution, end up suffering the most.
Pollution is the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death. It is
estimated to be several times more deaths than from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria
combined. Global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are reminders of
the strong linkages between environment and health and of the need to address such
linkages systematically.

Sri Lanka emerged as an independent country in 1948. The leaders of the Sinhala
community sought to secure dominance over government by virtue of their majority.
As a result, the democratically elected government adopted a series of
MAJORITARIAN measures to establish Sinhala supremacy. Over the years, it
created feelings of alienation among the Sri Lankan Tamils. They felt that none of
the major political parties led by the Buddhist Sinhala leaders was sensitive to their
language and culture. As a result, the relations between the Sinhala and Tamil
communities strained over time. On the other hand, the Belgian leaders took a
different path. They recognised the existence of regional differences and cultural
diversities. Between 1970 and 1993, they amended their constitution four times to
work out an arrangement that would enable everyone to live together within the same
country.

nationalists began recording folk tales sung by bards and they toured villages to
gather folk songs and legends. These tales gave a true picture of traditional culture.
It helped to restore a sense of pride in our past. In Bengal, Rabindranath Tagore

Climate and Irrigation:

2

● Haryana and Punjab have a well-developed irrigation system (e.g., canal
irrigation from the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal), which allows for large-scale
3

commercial cultivation of rice. The climate is suitable for high-yielding
varieties, and irrigation ensures water availability.
● In contrast, Odisha has a more monsoonal climate, and while rice is grown,
the farming is often rainfed and primarily for local consumption. The lack of
large-scale irrigation systems limits its commercialization.
Economic Factors (Market Access):
● In Punjab and Haryana, rice is grown for commercial purposes to meet
national and international demand. The proximity to markets, government
procurement systems, and well-developed transport networks enable these
states to export surplus rice.
● In Odisha, rice is mostly grown for personal or local use, with less access to
large markets for profit-driven farming, making it a subsistence crop.
Farming Practices:
● In Punjab and Haryana, the use of modern farming techniques, machinery,
and high-yielding varieties supports commercial rice cultivation.
● In Odisha, rice farming is more traditional and focused on family
sustenance rather than large-scale production, which reflects the
subsistence nature of cultivation.

principal lignite reserves are in Neyveli in Tamil Nadu and are used for
generation of electricity.
3. Bituminous coal-Coal that has been buried deep and subjected to increased
temperatures. It is the most popular coal in commercial use. Metallurgical coal
is high grade bituminous coal which has a special value for smelting iron in blast
furnaces.

1) air pollution – Smoke is emitted by chemical and paper factories, brick kilns,
refineries and smelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in big and small factories
that ignore pollution norms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous with long-term
effects.
2) Water pollution is caused by organic and inorganic industrial wastes and
affluents discharged into rivers. The main culprits in this regard are paper, pulp,
chemical, textile and dyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and electroplating
industries that let out dyes, detergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like lead
and mercury pesticides, fertilisers, synthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and
rubber, etc. into the water bodies.
3) Thermal pollution of water occurs when hot water from factories and thermal
plants is drained into rivers and ponds before cooling.
4) Dumping of wastes specially glass, harmful chemicals, industrial effluents,
packaging, salts and garbage renders the soil useless.
5)Rain water percolates to the soil carrying the pollutants to the ground and the
ground water also gets contaminated.
6) Industrial and construction activities, machinery, factory equipment, generators,
saws and pneumatic and electric drills also make a lot of noise. (Or any other

Features of federalism:

2

1. There are two or more levels (or tiers) of government.
2. Different tiers of government govern the same citizens, but each tier has its own
jurisdiction in specific matters of legislation, taxation and administration.
3. The jurisdictions of the respective levels or tiers of government are specified in
the constitution. So the existence and authority of each tier of government is
constitutionally guaranteed.
4. The fundamental provisions of the constitution cannot be unilaterally changed
by one level of government. Such changes require the consent of both the levels
of government.
5. Courts have the power to interpret the constitution and the powers of different
levels of government. The highest court acts as an umpire if disputes arise
between different levels of government in the exercise of their respective
powers.
6. Sources of revenue for each level of government are clearly specified to ensure
its financial autonomy.
7. The federal system thus has dual objectives: to safeguard and promote unity of
the country, while at the same time accommodate regional diversity. Therefore,
two aspects are crucial for the institutions and practice of federalism.
Governments at different levels should agree to some rules of power sharing.
They should also trust that each would abide by its part of the agreement. An
ideal federal system has both aspects: mutual trust and agreement to live
together.
(Any two point to be considered)

1. Education – Literacy rate among women is only 54% as compared with 76%
among men. Parents prefer to spend their resources for their sons’ education rather
than daughters.
2. Low Proportion of women in highly paid and valued jobs – Women still have
a small share in the highly paid jobs. Even if a woman works for more hours than a
man, her work is not given importance. This results in low paid and low valued jobs
for women.
3. Women are paid less than men – Despite the Equal Wages of Act women are
paid less than men, even when both do exactly the same work.
4. Preference for Son – In many parts of India parents prefer to have sons and
find ways to have the girl child aborted before she is born. This has led to decline
in child sex – ratio (927)
5. Exploitation at workplace and domestic violence – Women are exploited and
harassed at the workplace. They have to face different forms of domestic violence
at home.

1. Democracies accommodate various social divisions. For example, Belgium has
peacefully solved her ethnic problems and solved the differences.
2. All democracies usually develop a procedure to conduct competition, i.e. conduct
elections, power-sharing, etc. This reduces the possibility of tensions, due to social
divisions, turning violent or explosive.
3. Democracy teaches people to respect the differences and resolve conflicts
among different groups peacefully. In non-democratic countries, rulers either turn a
blind eye to or suppress internal differences. For example, Sri Lanka. The plus point
in democratic regime is the ability to handle social differences, divisions and
conflicts.
4. A democracy is not just a rule by majority opinion. The majority always needs to
work with the minority so that the government represents the general view.
5. A democratic government ensures that the rule by the majority does not become
autocratic in terms of religion, race or linguistic group etc. It tries to show that in
every election, different persons and groups can form a majority. It tries to see that
every citizen has a chance to be in majority at some point of time and is not barred
on the basis of birth. All these things ensured by a democratic regime lead to a
peaceful and harmonious life.

Political parties play a significant role in the effective working of a democracy. To
fill political offices and exercise political power, political parties are needed to
perform a series of functions, which are the following

5

1. Parties contest elections. Elections are fought mainly among candidates put up
by political parties.
In India, top party leaders choose candidates for contesting elections.
2. Parties put forward different policies and programmes. Political parties in a
democracy group together similar opinions, to provide a direction in which
government policies can be formulated.
3. Parties make laws for a country. Laws are debated and passed in the legislature.
4. Parties that lose elections play the role of the opposition. Opposition parties voice
their views by criticizing the government for its failure or wrong policies.
5. Parties shape public opinion. They raise and highlight issues and resolve
people’s problems. Many pressure groups are the extensions of political parties.
6. Parties provide people access to government machinery and welfare schemes.
For an ordinary citizen it is easier to approach a local party leader than a
government officer. (Any 5 points)
OR
27B

1. Most political parties do not practice open and transparent procedures for their
functioning. So there are very few ways for an ordinary worker to rise to the top
in a party.
2. Those who happen to be the leaders are in a position of unfair advantage as
they favour people close to them or even their family members.
3. In many parties in India, we see a trend of dynastic succession. The top positions
are always controlled by members of a particular family, which is unfair to other
7

members of the party, and bad for democracy.
4. This is so because people who do not have adequate experience or popular
support come to occupy positions of power.
5. More than loyalty to party principles and policies, personal loyalty to the leader
becomes more important. This tendency is seen all over the world, even in older
democracies.

1. The Constitution prescribed that the number of Dutch and French Any two
speaking ministers shall be equal in the central government.
Some special laws require the support of majority of members
from each linguistic group. Thus, no single community can make decisions
unilaterally.

of the two regions of the country. The state governments are not subordinate to the
Central Government.
3. Brussels has a separate government in which Dutch and French have equal

productive and healthy population. It reduces mortality rates, ensures the wellbeing of the workforce, and allows individuals to contribute meaningfully to the
economy. Inadequate healthcare can result in a higher burden of disease, lower
life expectancy, and economic inefficiencies.
Education and Skill Development:
● Public education systems are essential for providing equal learning opportunities
to all citizens, regardless of socioeconomic status. A well-educated population
leads to increased literacy rates, skill development, and innovation, all of which
are crucial for economic growth, reducing inequality, and fostering social
cohesion.
Sanitation and Clean Water:
● Proper sanitation and access to clean water are vital for maintaining public
health and preventing diseases such as cholera and dysentery. These services
significantly improve life expectancy, reduce healthcare costs, and increase
productivity, especially in rural or underserved areas.
Infrastructure Development:
● Public infrastructure, including roads, transportation, and energy, supports the
functioning of markets, businesses, and industries. It enhances connectivity,
stimulates economic activities, and improves the quality of life for individuals by
providing easy access to essential goods and services.

- Higher cost of borrowing from informal sources means a larger part of the earnings
of the borrowers is used to repay the loan. Hence, borrowers have less income left
for themselves (as we saw for Shyamal in Sonpur).
- In certain cases, the high interest rate for borrowing can mean that the amount to
be repaid is greater than the income of the borrower. -This could lead to increasing
debt (as we saw for Rama in Sonpur) and debt trap.
-Also, people who might wish to start an enterprise by borrowing may not do so
because of the high cost of borrowing.
-For these reasons, banks and cooperative societies need to lend more. This would
lead to higher incomes and many people could then borrow cheaply for a variety of
needs.

10.1 Introduction
You have studied in Class IX that a circle is a collection of all points in a plane
which are at a constant distance (radius) from a fixed point (centre). You have
also studied various terms related to a circle like chord, segment, sector, arc etc.
Let us now examine the different situations that can arise when a circle and a line
are given in a plane.
So, let us consider a circle and a line PQ. There can be three possibilities given
in Fig. 10.1 below:

Fig. 10.1
In Fig. 10.1 (i), the line PQ and the circle have no common point. In this case,
PQ is called a non-intersecting line with respect to the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (ii), there
are two common points A and B that the line PQ and the circle have. In this case, we
call the line PQ a secant of the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (iii), there is only one point A which
is common to the line PQ and the circle. In this case, the line is called a tangent to the
circle.

You might have seen a pulley fitted over a well which is used
in taking out water from the well. Look at Fig. 10.2. Here the rope
on both sides of the pulley, if considered as a ray, is like a tangent
to the circle representing the pulley.
Is there any position of the line with respect to the circle
other than the types given above? You can see that there cannot
be any other type of position of the line with respect to the circle.
In this chapter, we will study about the existence of the tangents
to a circle and also study some of their properties.

Fig. 10.2

10.2 Tangent to a Circle
In the previous section, you have seen that a tangent* to a circle is a line that
intersects the circle at only one point.
To understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform
the following activities:
Activity 1 : Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the
circular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table
and gently rotate the wire AB about the point P to get different positions of the straight
wire [see Fig. 10.3(i)].
In various positions, the wire intersects the
circular wire at P and at another point Q1 or Q2 or
Q3, etc. In one position, you will see that it will
intersect the circle at the point P only (see position
AB of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at
the point P of the circle. On rotating further, you
can observe that in all other positions of AB, it will
intersect the circle at P and at another point, say R1
or R2 or R3, etc. So, you can observe that there is
only one tangent at a point of the circle.
Fig. 10.3 (i)
While doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB
moves towards the position A B, the common point, say Q1, of the line AB and the
circle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point P. Ultimately, it coincides
with the point P in the position AB of AB. Again note, what happens if ‘AB’ is
rotated rightwards about P? The common point R3 gradually comes nearer and nearer
to P and ultimately coincides with P. So, what we see is:
The tangent to a circle is a special case of the secant, when the two end
points of its corresponding chord coincide.
*The word ‘tangent’ comes from the Latin word ‘tangere’, which means to touch and was
introduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fineke in 1583.

146

MATHEMATICS

Activity 2 : On a paper, draw a circle and a
secant PQ of the circle. Draw various lines
parallel to the secant on both sides of it. You
will find that after some steps, the length of
the chord cut by the lines will gradually
decrease, i.e., the two points of intersection of
the line and the circle are coming closer and
closer [see Fig. 10.3(ii)]. In one case, it
becomes zero on one side of the secant and in
another case, it becomes zero on the other side
of the secant. See the positions PQ and PQ
of the secant in Fig. 10.3 (ii). These are the
tangents to the circle parallel to the given secant
PQ. This also helps you to see that there cannot
be more than two tangents parallel to a given
secant.

Fig. 10.3 (ii)

This activity also establishes, what you must have observed, while doing
Activity 1, namely, a tangent is the secant when both of the end points of the
corresponding chord coincide.
The common point of the tangent and the circle is called the point of contact
[the point A in Fig. 10.1 (iii)]and the tangent is said to touch the circle at the
common point.
Now look around you. Have you seen a bicycle
or a cart moving? Look at its wheels. All the spokes
of a wheel are along its radii. Now note the position
of the wheel with respect to its movement on the
ground. Do you see any tangent anywhere?
(See Fig. 10.4). In fact, the wheel moves along a line
which is a tangent to the circle representing the wheel.
Also, notice that in all positions, the radius through
the point of contact with the ground appears to be at
right angles to the tangent (see Fig. 10.4). We shall
now prove this property of the tangent.

Fig. 10.4

Theorem 10.1 : The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the
radius through the point of contact.
Proof : We are given a circle with centre O and a tangent XY to the circle at a
point P. We need to prove that OP is perpendicular to XY.

Reprint 2025-26

CIRCLES

147

Take a point Q on XY other than P and join OQ (see Fig. 10.5).
The point Q must lie outside the circle.
(Why? Note that if Q lies inside the circle, XY
will become a secant and not a tangent to the
circle). Therefore, OQ is longer than the radius
OP of the circle. That is,
OQ > OP.
Since this happens for every point on the
line XY except the point P, OP is the
shortest of all the distances of the point O to the
points of XY. So OP is perpendicular to XY.
(as shown in Theorem A1.7.)

Fig. 10.5

Remarks
1. By theorem above, we can also conclude that at any point on a circle there can be
one and only one tangent.
2. The line containing the radius through the point of contact is also sometimes called
the ‘normal’ to the circle at the point.

10.3 Number of Tangents from a Point on a Circle
To get an idea of the number of tangents from a point on a circle, let us perform the
following activity:

MATHEMATICS

Activity 3 : Draw a circle on a paper. Take a
point P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the
circle through this point? You will find that all
the lines through this point intersect the circle in
two points. So, it is not possible to draw any
tangent to a circle through a point inside it
[see Fig. 10.6 (i)].
Next take a point P on the circle and draw
tangents through this point. You have already
observed that there is only one tangent to the
circle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)].

(i)

Finally, take a point P outside the circle and
try to draw tangents to the circle from this point.
What do you observe? You will find that you
can draw exactly two tangents to the circle
through this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)].
We can summarise these facts as follows:
Case 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing
through a point lying inside the circle.

(ii)

Case 2 : There is one and only one tangent to a
circle passing through a point lying on the circle.
Case 3 : There are exactly two tangents to a
circle through a point lying outside the circle.
In Fig. 10.6 (iii), T1and T2 are the points of
contact of the tangents PT 1 and PT 2
respectively.
The length of the segment of the tangent
from the external point P and the point of contact
with the circle is called the length of the tangent
from the point P to the circle.

(iii)
Fig. 10.6

Note that in Fig. 10.6 (iii), PT1 and PT2 are the lengths of the tangents from P to
the circle. The lengths PT1 and PT2 have a common property. Can you find this?
Measure PT1 and PT2. Are these equal? In fact, this is always so. Let us give a proof
of this fact in the following theorem.

Theorem 10.2 : The lengths of tangents drawn
from an external point to a circle are equal.
Proof : We are given a circle with centre O, a
point P lying outside the circle and two tangents
PQ, PR on the circle from P (see Fig. 10.7). We
are required to prove that PQ = PR.
For this, we join OP, OQ and OR. Then
∠ OQP and ∠ ORP are right angles, because
these are angles between the radii and tangents,
and according to Theorem 10.1 they are right
angles. Now in right triangles OQP and ORP,
OQ = OR

1. The theorem can also be proved by using the Pythagoras Theorem as follows:
PQ2 = OP2 – OQ2 = OP2 – OR2 = PR2 (As OQ = OR)
which gives PQ = PR.
2. Note also that ∠ OPQ = ∠ OPR. Therefore, OP is the angle bisector of ∠ QPR,
i.e., the centre lies on the bisector of the angle between the two tangents.
Let us take some examples.
Example 1 : Prove that in two concentric circles,
the chord of the larger circle, which touches the
smaller circle, is bisected at the point of contact.
Solution : We are given two concentric circles
C1 and C2 with centre O and a chord AB of the
larger circle C1 which touches the smaller circle
C2 at the point P (see Fig. 10.8). We need to prove
that AP = BP.
Let us join OP. Then, AB is a tangent to C2 at P
and OP is its radius. Therefore, by Theorem 10.1,
OP ⊥ AB

Now AB is a chord of the circle C1 and OP  AB. Therefore, OP is the bisector of the
chord AB, as the perpendicular from the centre bisects the chord,
i.e.,

AP = BP

10.2 Tangent to a Circle
In the previous section, you have seen that a tangent* to a circle is a line that
intersects the circle at only one point.
To understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform
the following activities:
Activity 1 : Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the
circular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table
and gently rotate the wire AB about the point P to get different positions of the straight
wire [see Fig. 10.3(i)].
In various positions, the wire intersects the
circular wire at P and at another point Q1 or Q2 or
Q3, etc. In one position, you will see that it will
intersect the circle at the point P only (see position
AB of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at
the point P of the circle. On rotating further, you
can observe that in all other positions of AB, it will
intersect the circle at P and at another point, say R1
or R2 or R3, etc. So, you can observe that there is
only one tangent at a point of the circle.
Fig. 10.3 (i)
While doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB
moves towards the position A B, the common point, say Q1, of the line AB and the
circle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point P. Ultimately, it coincides
with the point P in the position AB of AB. Again note, what happens if ‘AB’ is
rotated rightwards about P? The common point R3 gradually comes nearer and nearer
to P and ultimately coincides with P. So, what we see is:
The tangent to a circle is a special case of the secant, when the two end
points of its corresponding chord coincide.
*The word ‘tangent’ comes from the Latin word ‘tangere’, which means to touch and was
introduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fineke in 1583.

MATHEMATICS

Activity 2 : On a paper, draw a circle and a
secant PQ of the circle. Draw various lines
parallel to the secant on both sides of it. You
will find that after some steps, the length of
the chord cut by the lines will gradually
decrease, i.e., the two points of intersection of
the line and the circle are coming closer and
closer [see Fig. 10.3(ii)]. In one case, it
becomes zero on one side of the secant and in
another case, it becomes zero on the other side
of the secant. See the positions PQ and PQ
of the secant in Fig. 10.3 (ii). These are the
tangents to the circle parallel to the given secant
PQ. This also helps you to see that there cannot
be more than two tangents parallel to a given
secant.

Fig. 10.3 (ii)

This activity also establishes, what you must have observed, while doing
Activity 1, namely, a tangent is the secant when both of the end points of the
corresponding chord coincide.
The common point of the tangent and the circle is called the point of contact
[the point A in Fig. 10.1 (iii)]and the tangent is said to touch the circle at the
common point.
Now look around you. Have you seen a bicycle
or a cart moving? Look at its wheels. All the spokes
of a wheel are along its radii. Now note the position
of the wheel with respect to its movement on the
ground. Do you see any tangent anywhere?
(See Fig. 10.4). In fact, the wheel moves along a line
which is a tangent to the circle representing the wheel.
Also, notice that in all positions, the radius through
the point of contact with the ground appears to be at
right angles to the tangent (see Fig. 10.4). We shall
now prove this property of the tangent.

Fig. 10.4

Theorem 10.1 : The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the
radius through the point of contact.
Proof : We are given a circle with centre O and a tangent XY to the circle at a
point P. We need to prove that OP is perpendicular to XY.

Reprint 2025-26

CIRCLES

147

Take a point Q on XY other than P and join OQ (see Fig. 10.5).
The point Q must lie outside the circle.
(Why? Note that if Q lies inside the circle, XY
will become a secant and not a tangent to the
circle). Therefore, OQ is longer than the radius
OP of the circle. That is,
OQ > OP.
Since this happens for every point on the
line XY except the point P, OP is the
shortest of all the distances of the point O to the
points of XY. So OP is perpendicular to XY.
(as shown in Theorem A1.7.)

Fig. 10.5

Remarks
1. By theorem above, we can also conclude that at any point on a circle there can be
one and only one tangent.
2. The line containing the radius through the point of contact is also sometimes called
the ‘normal’ to the circle at the point.

10.3 Number of Tangents from a Point on a Circle
To get an idea of the number of tangents from a point on a circle, let us perform the
following activity:

Reprint 2025-26

148

MATHEMATICS

Activity 3 : Draw a circle on a paper. Take a
point P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the
circle through this point? You will find that all
the lines through this point intersect the circle in
two points. So, it is not possible to draw any
tangent to a circle through a point inside it
[see Fig. 10.6 (i)].
Next take a point P on the circle and draw
tangents through this point. You have already
observed that there is only one tangent to the
circle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)].

(i)

Finally, take a point P outside the circle and
try to draw tangents to the circle from this point.
What do you observe? You will find that you
can draw exactly two tangents to the circle
through this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)].
We can summarise these facts as follows:
Case 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing
through a point lying inside the circle.

(ii)

Case 2 : There is one and only one tangent to a
circle passing through a point lying on the circle.
Case 3 : There are exactly two tangents to a
circle through a point lying outside the circle.
In Fig. 10.6 (iii), T1and T2 are the points of
contact of the tangents PT 1 and PT 2
respectively.
The length of the segment of the tangent
from the external point P and the point of contact
with the circle is called the length of the tangent
from the point P to the circle.

(iii)
Fig. 10.6

Note that in Fig. 10.6 (iii), PT1 and PT2 are the lengths of the tangents from P to
the circle. The lengths PT1 and PT2 have a common property. Can you find this?
Measure PT1 and PT2. Are these equal? In fact, this is always so. Let us give a proof
of this fact in the following theorem.

Theorem 10.2 : The lengths of tangents drawn
from an external point to a circle are equal.
Proof : We are given a circle with centre O, a
point P lying outside the circle and two tangents
PQ, PR on the circle from P (see Fig. 10.7). We
are required to prove that PQ = PR.
For this, we join OP, OQ and OR. Then
∠ OQP and ∠ ORP are right angles, because
these are angles between the radii and tangents,
and according to Theorem 10.1 they are right
angles. Now in right triangles OQP and ORP,
OQ = OR

Fig. 10.7
(Radii of the same circle)

OP = OP

(Common)

Therefore,

∆ OQP ≅ ∆ ORP

(RHS)

This gives

PQ = PR

(CPCT)

Remarks
1. The theorem can also be proved by using the Pythagoras Theorem as follows:
PQ2 = OP2 – OQ2 = OP2 – OR2 = PR2 (As OQ = OR)
which gives PQ = PR.
2. Note also that ∠ OPQ = ∠ OPR. Therefore, OP is the angle bisector of ∠ QPR,
i.e., the centre lies on the bisector of the angle between the two tangents.
Let us take some examples.
Example 1 : Prove that in two concentric circles,
the chord of the larger circle, which touches the
smaller circle, is bisected at the point of contact.
Solution : We are given two concentric circles
C1 and C2 with centre O and a chord AB of the
larger circle C1 which touches the smaller circle
C2 at the point P (see Fig. 10.8). We need to prove
that AP = BP.
Let us join OP. Then, AB is a tangent to C2 at P
and OP is its radius. Therefore, by Theorem 10.1,
OP ⊥ AB

Reprint 2025-26

Now AB is a chord of the circle C1 and OP  AB. Therefore, OP is the bisector of the
chord AB, as the perpendicular from the centre bisects the chord,
i.e.,

AP = BP

Example 2 : Two tangents TP and TQ are drawn
to a circle with centre O from an external point T.
Prove that  PTQ = 2  OPQ.
Solution : We are given a circle with centre O,
an external point T and two tangents TP and TQ

 PTQ = 2  OPQ

 PTQ = 

Now, by Theorem 10.2, TP = TQ. So, TPQ is an isosceles triangle.

Example 3 : PQ is a chord of length 8 cm of a
circle of radius 5 cm. The tangents at P and Q
intersect at a point T (see Fig. 10.10). Find the
length TP.
Solution : Join OT. Let it intersect PQ at the
point R. Then  TPQ is isosceles and TO is the
angle bisector of  PTQ. So, OT  PQ
and therefore, OT bisects PQ which gives
PR = RQ = 4 cm.
