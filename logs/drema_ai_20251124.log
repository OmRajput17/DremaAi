They say faith can move mountains. But what should we put our
faith in? This is the question this story delicately poses.
Lencho is a farmer who writes a letter to God when his crops
are ruined, asking for a hundred pesos. Does Lencho’s letter reach
God? Does God send him the money? Think what your answers to
these questions would be, and guess how the story continues, before
you begin to read it.

A Letter to God

THE house — the only one in the entire valley — sat
on the crest of a low hill. From this height one crest
could see the river and the field of ripe corn dotted top of a hill
with the flowers that always promised a good
harvest. The only thing the earth needed was a
downpour or at least a shower. Throughout the
morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately
— had done nothing else but see the sky towards
the north-east.
“Now we’re really going to get some water, woman.”
The woman who was preparing supper, replied,
“Yes, God willing”. The older boys were working in
the field, while the smaller ones were playing near
the house until the woman called to them all, “Come
for dinner”. It was during the meal that, just as

First Flight

Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to
fall. In the north-east huge mountains of clouds
could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and
sweet. The man went out for no other reason than
to have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body,
and when he returned he exclaimed, ‘‘These aren’t
raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.
The big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones
are fives.’’
With a satisfied expression he regarded the field
of ripe corn with its flowers, draped in a curtain of
rain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow
and along with the rain very large hailstones began
to fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins.
The boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out
to collect the frozen pearls.
‘‘It’s really getting bad now,’’ exclaimed the man.
“I hope it passes quickly.” It did not pass quickly.
For an hour the hail rained on the house, the
garden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole
valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.
Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was
totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the
plants. Lencho’s soul was filled with sadness. When
the storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the
field and said to his sons, “A plague of locusts would

That night was a sorrowful one.
“All our work, for nothing.”
‘‘There’s no one who can help us.”
“We’ll all go hungry this year.”

A Letter to God

But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary
house in the middle of the valley, there was a single
hope: help from God.
“Don’t be so upset, even though this seems like
a total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.”
“That’s what they say: no one dies of hunger.”
All through the night, Lencho thought only of
his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he
had been instructed, see everything, even what is
deep in one’s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a
man, working like an animal in the fields, but still
he knew how to write. The following Sunday, at
daybreak, he began to write a letter which he
himself would carry to town and place in the mail.
It was nothing less than a letter to God.
“God,” he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family
and I will go hungry this year. I need a hundred
pesos in order to sow my field again and to live
until the crop comes, because the hailstorm... .”
He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter
inside and, still troubled, went to town. At the post
office, he placed a stamp on the letter and dropped
it into the mailbox.
One of the employees, who was a postman and
also helped at the post office, went to his boss
laughing heartily and showed him the letter to God.
Never in his career as a postman had he known
that address. The postmaster — a fat, amiable

First Flight
6

fellow — also broke out laughing, but almost
immediately he turned serious and, tapping the
letter on his desk, commented, “What faith! I wish I
had the faith of the man who wrote this letter.
Starting up a correspondence with God!”
So, in order not to shake the writer’s faith in God,
the postmaster came up with an idea: answer the
letter. But when he opened it, it was evident that to
answer it he needed something more than goodwill,
ink and paper. But he stuck to his resolution: he
asked for money from his employees, he himself gave
part of his salary, and several friends of his were
obliged to give something ‘for an act of charity’.
It was impossible for him to gather together the
hundred pesos, so he was able to send the farmer
only a little more than half. He put the money in an
envelope addressed to Lencho and with it a letter
containing only a single word as a signature: God.

1. Who or what did Lencho have faith in? What did he do?
2. Who read the letter?
3. What did the postmaster do then?

The following Sunday Lencho came a bit earlier
than usual to ask if there was a letter for him.
It was the postman himself who handed the letter
to him while the postmaster, experiencing the
contentment of a man who has performed a good contentment
satisfaction
deed, looked on from his office.
Lencho showed not the slightest surprise on
seeing the money; such was his confidence — but
he became angry when he counted the money. God
could not have made a mistake, nor could he have
denied Lencho what he had requested.
Immediately, Lencho went up to the window to
ask for paper and ink. On the public writing-table,
he started to write, with much wrinkling of his brow,
caused by the effort he had to make to express his
ideas. When he finished, he went to the window to
buy a stamp which he licked and then affixed to

Reprint 2025-26

the envelope with a blow of his fist. The moment
the letter fell into the mailbox the postmaster went
to open it. It said: “God: Of the money that I asked
for, only seventy pesos reached me. Send me the
rest, since I need it very much. But don’t send it to
me through the mail because the post office
employees are a bunch of crooks. Lencho.”

6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story: between humans and nature,

I. Look at the following sentence from the story.
Suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large
hailstones began to fall.

First Flight

‘Hailstones’ are small balls of ice that fall like rain. A storm in which
hailstones fall is a ‘hailstorm’. You know that a storm is bad weather with
strong winds, rain, thunder and lightning.
There are different names in different parts of the world for storms,
depending on their nature. Can you match the names in the box with
their descriptions below, and fill in the blanks? You may use a dictionary
to help you.

4. A violent storm whose centre is a cloud in the shape of a funnel:

Ocean: __ __ r __ __ __ __ __ __
6. A very strong wind that moves very fast in a spinning movement and
causes a lot of damage: __ __ __ __ l __ __ __ __
II. Notice how the word ‘hope’ is used in these sentences from the story:
(a) I hope it (the hailstorm) passes quickly.
(b) There was a single hope: help from God.
In the first example, ‘hope’ is a verb which means you wish for something to
happen. In the second example it is a noun meaning a chance for something
to happen.

III. Relative Clauses

9

Look at these sentences
(a) All morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately — looked at
the sky.
(b) The woman, who was preparing supper, replied, “Yes, God willing.’’

The relative clauses in (a) and (b) above are called non-defining, because
we already know the identity of the person they describe. Lencho is a
particular person, and there is a particular woman he speaks to. We don’t
need the information in the relative clause to pick these people out from a
larger set.
A non-defining relative clause usually has a comma in front of it and a
comma after it (some writers use a dash (—) instead, as in the story). If the
relative clause comes at the end, we just put a full stop.
Join the sentences given below using who, whom, whose, which, as
suggested.
1. I often go to Mumbai. Mumbai is the commercial capital of India. (which)
2. My mother is going to host a TV show on cooking. She cooks very
well. (who)

Reprint 2025-26

A Letter to God

The italicised parts of the sentences give us more information about Lencho
and the woman. We call them relative clauses. Notice that they begin with
a relative pronoun who. Other common relative pronouns are whom, whose,
and which.

3. These sportspersons are going to meet the President. Their performance
has been excellent. (whose)
4. Lencho prayed to God. His eyes see into our minds. (whose)
5. This man cheated me. I trusted him. (whom)
Sometimes the relative pronoun in a relative clause remains ‘hidden’. For
example, look at the first sentence of the story:
(a) The house — the only one in the entire valley — sat on the crest of a
low hill.
We can rewrite this sentence as:
(b) The house — which was the only one in the entire valley — sat on
the crest of a low hill.
In (a), the relative pronoun which and the verb was are not present.

First Flight

IV. Using Negatives for Emphasis

10

We know that sentences with words such as no, not or nothing show the
absence of something, or contradict something. For example:
(a) This year we will have no corn. (Corn will be absent)
(b) The hail has left nothing. (Absence of a crop)
(c) These aren’t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.
(Contradicts the common idea of what the drops of water falling from
the sky are)
But sometims negative words are used just to emphasise an idea. Look at
these sentences from the story:
(d) Lencho…had done nothing else but see the sky towards the northeast. (He had done only this)
(e) The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of
feeling the rain on his body. (He had only this reason)
(f) Lencho showed not the slightest surprise on seeing the money.
(He showed no surprise at all)
Now look back at example (c). Notice that the contradiction in fact serves to
emphasise the value or usefulness of the rain to the farmer.
Find sentences in the story with negative words, which express the
following ideas emphatically.
1. The trees lost all their leaves.

2. The letter was addressed to God himself.

3. The postman saw this address for the first time in his career.

V. Metaphors
The word metaphor comes from a Greek word meaning ‘transfer’. Metaphors
compare two things or ideas: a quality or feature of one thing is transferred
to another thing. Some common metaphors are
• the leg of the table: The leg supports our body. So the object that supports
a table is described as a leg.
• the heart of the city: The heart is an important organ in the centre of our
body. So this word is used to describe the central area of a city.
In pairs, find metaphors from the story to complete the table below. Try
to say what qualities are being compared. One has been done for you.

WHAT YOU CAN D O
Before You Read : Encourage students to share their ideas about what will happen in the
story.
Activity : Before filling out the form, get the students to read through the form and
decide which parts they should fill out, and which parts will be filled in by the postal
department. Ask a few students to volunteer to actually send a money order (the
amount need not be large) and share the experience with the rest of the class.

Grammar: After they have done the exercise, ask students to make their own sentences
with non-defining relative clauses — for example, ‘Meena, who’s a very clever girl, is
always first in class.’ Or, ‘Our gardener, who knows a lot about plants, loves to talk
about them.’
Speaking: Take the first turn — talk to the students about an instance from your own
life, or from that of someone you know.

This poem presents a moment that seems simple, but has a larger significance.
[Compare this other quotation from Robert Frost: “Always, always a larger
significance... A little thing touches a larger thing.”)
1. What is a “dust of snow”? What does the poet say has changed his mood?
How has the poet’s mood changed?
2. How does Frost present nature in this poem? The following questions may
help you to think of an answer.
(i) What are the birds that are usually named in poems? Do you think a
crow is often mentioned in poems? What images come to your mind
when you think of a crow?
(ii) Again, what is “a hemlock tree”? Why doesn’t the poet write about a
more ‘beautiful’ tree such as a maple, or an oak, or a pine?
(iii) What do the ‘crow’ and ‘hemlock’ represent — joy or sorrow? What does
the dust of snow that the crow shakes off a hemlock tree stand for?

experienced a similar moment that changed your mood that day?

Nelson Mandela has become South Africa’s first Black
President after more than three centuries of White rule.
Mr Mandela’s African National Congress (ANC) party won
252 of the 400 seats in the first democratic elections of South
Africa’s history.
The inauguration ceremony took place in the Union
Buildings amphitheatre in Pretoria today, attended by
politicians and dignitaries from more than 140 countries
around the world. “Never, never again will this beautiful land
experience the oppression of one by another, ” said Nelson
Mandela in his address.
… Jubilant scenes on the streets of Pretoria followed the
ceremony with blacks, whites and coloureds celebrating
together... More than 100,000 South African men, women
and children of all races sang and danced with joy.

Nelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom

TENTH May dawned bright and clear. For the past
few days I had been pleasantly besieged by
dignitaries and world leaders who were coming to
pay their respects before the inauguration. The
inauguration would be the largest gathering ever of
international leaders on South African soil.
The ceremonies took place in the lovely
sandstone amphitheatre formed by the Union
Buildings in Pretoria. For decades this had been
the seat of white supremacy, and now it was the
site of a rainbow gathering of different colours and
nations for the installation of South Africa’s first
democratic, non-racial government.
On that lovely autumn day I was accompanied
by my daughter Zenani. On the podium, Mr de Klerk
was first sworn in as second deputy president. Then

Thabo Mbeki was sworn in as first deputy president.

human dignity.
We have, at last, achieved our political emancipation.
We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the
continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering,
gender and other discrimination.
Never, never, and never again shall it be that this

Nelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom

A few moments later we all lifted our eyes in
awe as a spectacular array of South African jets,
helicopters and troop carriers roared in perfect
formation over the Union Buildings. It was not only
a display of pinpoint precision and military force,
but a demonstration of the military’s loyalty to
democracy, to a new government that had been
freely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the
highest generals of the South African defence force
and police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and
medals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged
their loyalty. I was not unmindful of the fact that
not so many years before they would not have
saluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala
jets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue
and gold of the new South African flag.
The day was symbolised for me by the playing of
our two national anthems, and the vision of whites
singing ‘Nkosi Sikelel –iAfrika’ and blacks singing
‘Die Stem’, the old anthem of the Republic. Although
that day neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem
they once despised, they would soon know the
words by heart.
On the day of the inauguration, I was
overwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first
decade of the twentieth century, a few years after
the bitter Anglo-Boer war and before my own birth,
the white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched
up their differences and erected a system of racial
domination against the dark-skinned peoples of their
own land. The structure they created formed the
basis of one of the harshest, most inhumane,
societies the world has ever known. Now, in the
last decade of the twentieth century, and my own
eighth decade as a man, that system had been

First Flight

overturned forever and replaced by one that
recognised the rights and freedoms of all peoples,
regardless of the colour of their skin.
That day had come about through the
unimaginable sacrifices of thousands of my people,
people whose suffering and courage can never be
counted or repaid. I felt that day, as I have on so
many other days, that I was simply the sum of all
those African patriots who had gone before me. That
long and noble line ended and now began again
with me. I was pained that I was not able to thank
them and that they were not able to see what their
sacrifices had wrought.
The policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting
wound in my country and my people. All of us will
spend many years, if not generations, recovering
from that profound hurt. But the decades of
oppression and brutality had another, unintended,
effect, and that was that it produced the Oliver
Tambos, the Walter Sisulus, the Chief Luthulis, the

courage, wisdom and generosity that their like may
never be known again. Perhaps it requires such
depths of oppression to create such heights of
character. My country is rich in the minerals and
gems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always
known that its greatest wealth is its people, finer
and truer than the purest diamonds.
It is from these comrades in the struggle that I
learned the meaning of courage. Time and again, I
have seen men and women risk and give their lives
for an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks
and torture without breaking, showing a strength
and resilience that defies the imagination. I learned
that courage was not the absence of fear, but the
triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does
not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.
No one is born hating another person because of
the colour of his skin, or his background, or his
religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can
learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love
comes more naturally to the human heart than its
opposite. Even in the grimmest times in prison, when
my comrades and I were pushed to our limits, I would
see a glimmer of humanity in one of the guards,
perhaps just for a second, but it was enough to
reassure me and keep me going. Man’s goodness is
a flame that can be hidden but never extinguished.

society, each man is able to fulfil those obligations
according to his own inclinations and abilities. But
in a country like South Africa, it was almost
impossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil
both of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of
colour who attempted to live as a human being was
punished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who
tried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably
ripped from his family and his home and was forced
to live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy
and rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to
place my people above my family, but in attempting
to serve my people, I found that I was prevented
from fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a
father and a husband.
I was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born
free — free in every way that I could know. Free to
run in the fields near my mother’s hut, free to swim
in the clear stream that ran through my village, free
to roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad
backs of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my
father and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was
not troubled by the laws of man or God.
It was only when I began to learn that my boyhood
freedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a
young man that my freedom had already been taken
from me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a
student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the
transitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night,
read what I pleased and go where I chose. Later, as
a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the
basic and honourable freedoms of achieving my
potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and
having a family — the freedom not to be obstructed
in a lawful life.
But then I slowly saw that not only was I not
free, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I
saw that it was not just my freedom that was
curtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked
like I did. That is when I joined the African National
Congress, and that is when the hunger for my own
freedom became the greater hunger for the freedom

of my people. It was this desire for the freedom of
my people to live their lives with dignity and selfrespect that animated my life, that transformed a
frightened young man into a bold one, that drove a
law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that
turned a family-loving husband into a man without
a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a
monk. I am no more virtuous or self-sacrificing
than the next man, but I found that I could not
even enjoy the poor and limited freedoms I was
allowed when I knew my people were not free.
Freedom is indivisible; the chains on anyone of
my people were the chains on all of them, the
chains on all of my people were the chains on me.
I knew that the oppressor must be liberated just
as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away
another man’s freedom is a prisoner of hatred; he is
locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrowmindedness. I am not truly free if I am taking away
someone else’s freedom, just as surely as I am not
free when my freedom is taken from me. The oppressed
and the oppressor alike are robbed of their humanity.

II. Using the Definite Article with Names
You know that the definite article ‘the’ is not normally used before proper
nouns. Nor do proper nouns usually occur in the plural. (We do not say:

from the text:

… the decades of oppression and brutality … produced the Oliver Tambos,
the Walter Sisulus, … of our time.
Used in this way with the and/or in the plural, a proper noun carries a
special meaning. For example, what do you think the names above mean?
Choose the right answer.
(b) many other men like Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu …/many men of
their type or kind, whose names may not be as well known.
Did you choose option (b)? Then you have the right answer!
Here are some more examples of ‘the’ used with proper names. Try to
say what these sentences mean. (You may consult a dictionary if you
wish. Look at the entry for ‘the’.)

Khans to his parties.

A T
iger in the Zoo
Tiger
This poem contrasts a tiger in the zoo with the tiger in its natural
habitat. The poem moves from the zoo to the jungle, and back again
to the zoo. Read the poem silently once, and say which stanzas
speak about the tiger in the zoo, and which ones speak about the
tiger in the jungle.

He stalks in his vivid stripes
The few steps of his cage,
On pads of velvet quiet,
In his quiet rage.
He should be lurking in shadow,
Sliding through long grass
Near the water hole
Where plump deer pass.
He should be snarling around houses
At the jungle’s edge,
Baring his white fangs, his claws,
Terrorising the village!
But he’s locked in a concrete cell,
His strength behind bars,
Stalking the length of his cage,
Ignoring visitors.
He hears the last voice at night,
The patrolling cars,
And stares with his brilliant eyes
At the brilliant stars.

Because they spoil my view
I wish I were wild, not on show.
But if I were wild, hunters might shoot me,
But if I were wild, food might poison me,
But if I were wild, water might drown me.

The Panther
His vision, from the constantly passing bars,
has grown so weary that it cannot hold
anything else. It seems to him there are
a thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.
As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,
the movement of his powerful soft strides
is like a ritual dance around a centre
in which a mighty will stands paralysed.
Only at times, the curtain of the pupils
lifts, quietly. An image enters in,
rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,
plunges into the heart and is gone.

Nelson Mandela has become South Africa’s first Black
President after more than three centuries of White rule.
Mr Mandela’s African National Congress (ANC) party won
252 of the 400 seats in the first democratic elections of South
Africa’s history.
The inauguration ceremony took place in the Union
Buildings amphitheatre in Pretoria today, attended by
politicians and dignitaries from more than 140 countries
around the world. “Never, never again will this beautiful land
experience the oppression of one by another, ” said Nelson
Mandela in his address.
… Jubilant scenes on the streets of Pretoria followed the
ceremony with blacks, whites and coloureds celebrating
together... More than 100,000 South African men, women

Nelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom

TENTH May dawned bright and clear. For the past
few days I had been pleasantly besieged by
dignitaries and world leaders who were coming to
pay their respects before the inauguration. The
inauguration would be the largest gathering ever of
international leaders on South African soil.
The ceremonies took place in the lovely
sandstone amphitheatre formed by the Union
Buildings in Pretoria. For decades this had been
the seat of white supremacy, and now it was the
site of a rainbow gathering of different colours and
nations for the installation of South Africa’s first
democratic, non-racial government.
On that lovely autumn day I was accompanied
by my daughter Zenani. On the podium, Mr de Klerk
was first sworn in as second deputy president. Then

We have, at last, achieved our political emancipation.
We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the
continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering,

Never, never, and never again shall it be that this

Nelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom

A few moments later we all lifted our eyes in
awe as a spectacular array of South African jets,
helicopters and troop carriers roared in perfect
formation over the Union Buildings. It was not only
a display of pinpoint precision and military force,
but a demonstration of the military’s loyalty to
democracy, to a new government that had been
freely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the
highest generals of the South African defence force
and police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and
medals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged
their loyalty. I was not unmindful of the fact that
not so many years before they would not have
saluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala
jets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue
and gold of the new South African flag.
The day was symbolised for me by the playing of
our two national anthems, and the vision of whites
singing ‘Nkosi Sikelel –iAfrika’ and blacks singing
‘Die Stem’, the old anthem of the Republic. Although
that day neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem
they once despised, they would soon know the
words by heart.
On the day of the inauguration, I was
overwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first
decade of the twentieth century, a few years after
the bitter Anglo-Boer war and before my own birth,
the white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched
up their differences and erected a system of racial
domination against the dark-skinned peoples of their
own land. The structure they created formed the
basis of one of the harshest, most inhumane,
societies the world has ever known. Now, in the
last decade of the twentieth century, and my own
eighth decade as a man, that system had been

First Flight

overturned forever and replaced by one that
recognised the rights and freedoms of all peoples,
regardless of the colour of their skin.
That day had come about through the
unimaginable sacrifices of thousands of my people,
people whose suffering and courage can never be
counted or repaid. I felt that day, as I have on so
many other days, that I was simply the sum of all
those African patriots who had gone before me. That
long and noble line ended and now began again
with me. I was pained that I was not able to thank
them and that they were not able to see what their
sacrifices had wrought.
The policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting
wound in my country and my people. All of us will
spend many years, if not generations, recovering
from that profound hurt. But the decades of
oppression and brutality had another, unintended,
effect, and that was that it produced the Oliver
Tambos, the Walter Sisulus, the Chief Luthulis, the

courage, wisdom and generosity that their like may
never be known again. Perhaps it requires such
depths of oppression to create such heights of
character. My country is rich in the minerals and
gems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always
known that its greatest wealth is its people, finer
and truer than the purest diamonds.
It is from these comrades in the struggle that I
learned the meaning of courage. Time and again, I
have seen men and women risk and give their lives
for an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks
and torture without breaking, showing a strength
and resilience that defies the imagination. I learned
that courage was not the absence of fear, but the
triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does
not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.
No one is born hating another person because of
the colour of his skin, or his background, or his
religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can
learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love
comes more naturally to the human heart than its
opposite. Even in the grimmest times in prison, when
my comrades and I were pushed to our limits, I would
see a glimmer of humanity in one of the guards,
perhaps just for a second, but it was enough to
reassure me and keep me going. Man’s goodness is

society, each man is able to fulfil those obligations
according to his own inclinations and abilities. But
in a country like South Africa, it was almost
impossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil
both of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of
colour who attempted to live as a human being was
punished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who
tried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably
ripped from his family and his home and was forced
to live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy
and rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to
place my people above my family, but in attempting
to serve my people, I found that I was prevented
from fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a
father and a husband.
I was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born
free — free in every way that I could know. Free to
run in the fields near my mother’s hut, free to swim
in the clear stream that ran through my village, free
to roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad
backs of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my
father and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was
not troubled by the laws of man or God.
It was only when I began to learn that my boyhood
freedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a
young man that my freedom had already been taken
from me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a
student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the
transitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night,
read what I pleased and go where I chose. Later, as
a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the
basic and honourable freedoms of achieving my
potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and
having a family — the freedom not to be obstructed
in a lawful life.
But then I slowly saw that not only was I not
free, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I
saw that it was not just my freedom that was
curtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked
like I did. That is when I joined the African National
Congress, and that is when the hunger for my own
freedom became the greater hunger for the freedom

of my people. It was this desire for the freedom of
my people to live their lives with dignity and selfrespect that animated my life, that transformed a
frightened young man into a bold one, that drove a
law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that
turned a family-loving husband into a man without
a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a
monk. I am no more virtuous or self-sacrificing
than the next man, but I found that I could not
even enjoy the poor and limited freedoms I was
allowed when I knew my people were not free.
Freedom is indivisible; the chains on anyone of
my people were the chains on all of them, the
chains on all of my people were the chains on me.
I knew that the oppressor must be liberated just
as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away
another man’s freedom is a prisoner of hatred; he is
locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrowmindedness. I am not truly free if I am taking away
someone else’s freedom, just as surely as I am not
free when my freedom is taken from me. The oppressed
and the oppressor alike are robbed of their humanity.

II. Using the Definite Article with Names
You know that the definite article ‘the’ is not normally used before proper

from the text:

25

the Walter Sisulus, … of our time.
Used in this way with the and/or in the plural, a proper noun carries a
special meaning. For example, what do you think the names above mean?
Choose the right answer.

A T
iger in the Zoo
Tiger
This poem contrasts a tiger in the zoo with the tiger in its natural
habitat. The poem moves from the zoo to the jungle, and back again
to the zoo. Read the poem silently once, and say which stanzas
speak about the tiger in the zoo, and which ones speak about the
tiger in the jungle.

He stalks in his vivid stripes
The few steps of his cage,
On pads of velvet quiet,
In his quiet rage.
He should be lurking in shadow,
Sliding through long grass
Near the water hole
Where plump deer pass.
He should be snarling around houses
At the jungle’s edge,
Baring his white fangs, his claws,
Terrorising the village!
But he’s locked in a concrete cell,
His strength behind bars,
Stalking the length of his cage,
Ignoring visitors.
He hears the last voice at night,
The patrolling cars,
And stares with his brilliant eyes
At the brilliant stars.

The Tiger
The tiger behind the bars of his cage growls,
The tiger behind the bars of his cage snarls,
The tiger behind the bars of his cage roars.
Then he thinks.
It would be nice not to be behind bars all
The time
Because they spoil my view
I wish I were wild, not on show.
But if I were wild, hunters might shoot me,
But if I were wild, food might poison me,
But if I were wild, water might drown me.
Then he stops thinking
And...
The tiger behind the bars of his cage growls,
The tiger behind the bars of his cage snarls,
The tiger behind the bars of his cage roars.

The Panther
His vision, from the constantly passing bars,
has grown so weary that it cannot hold
anything else. It seems to him there are
a thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.
As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,
the movement of his powerful soft strides
is like a ritual dance around a centre
in which a mighty will stands paralysed.
Only at times, the curtain of the pupils
lifts, quietly. An image enters in,
rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,
plunges into the heart and is gone.

A Letter to God

THE house — the only one in the entire valley — sat
on the crest of a low hill. From this height one crest
could see the river and the field of ripe corn dotted top of a hill
with the flowers that always promised a good
harvest. The only thing the earth needed was a
downpour or at least a shower. Throughout the
morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately
— had done nothing else but see the sky towards
the north-east.
“Now we’re really going to get some water, woman.”
The woman who was preparing supper, replied,
“Yes, God willing”. The older boys were working in
the field, while the smaller ones were playing near
the house until the woman called to them all, “Come
for dinner”. It was during the meal that, just as

First Flight

Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to
fall. In the north-east huge mountains of clouds
could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and
sweet. The man went out for no other reason than
to have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body,
and when he returned he exclaimed, ‘‘These aren’t
raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.
The big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones
are fives.’’
With a satisfied expression he regarded the field
of ripe corn with its flowers, draped in a curtain of
rain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow
and along with the rain very large hailstones began
to fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins.
The boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out
to collect the frozen pearls.
‘‘It’s really getting bad now,’’ exclaimed the man.
“I hope it passes quickly.” It did not pass quickly.
For an hour the hail rained on the house, the
garden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole
valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.
Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was
totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the
plants. Lencho’s soul was filled with sadness. When
the storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the
field and said to his sons, “A plague of locusts would

‘‘There’s no one who can help us.”
“We’ll all go hungry this year.”

A Letter to God

But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary
house in the middle of the valley, there was a single
hope: help from God.
“Don’t be so upset, even though this seems like
a total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.”
“That’s what they say: no one dies of hunger.”
All through the night, Lencho thought only of
his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he
had been instructed, see everything, even what is
deep in one’s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a
man, working like an animal in the fields, but still
he knew how to write. The following Sunday, at
daybreak, he began to write a letter which he
himself would carry to town and place in the mail.
It was nothing less than a letter to God.
“God,” he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family
and I will go hungry this year. I need a hundred
pesos in order to sow my field again and to live
until the crop comes, because the hailstorm... .”
He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter
inside and, still troubled, went to town. At the post
office, he placed a stamp on the letter and dropped
it into the mailbox.
One of the employees, who was a postman and
also helped at the post office, went to his boss
laughing heartily and showed him the letter to God.
Never in his career as a postman had he known
that address. The postmaster — a fat, amiable

First Flight
6

fellow — also broke out laughing, but almost
immediately he turned serious and, tapping the
letter on his desk, commented, “What faith! I wish I
had the faith of the man who wrote this letter.
Starting up a correspondence with God!”
So, in order not to shake the writer’s faith in God,
the postmaster came up with an idea: answer the
letter. But when he opened it, it was evident that to
answer it he needed something more than goodwill,
ink and paper. But he stuck to his resolution: he
asked for money from his employees, he himself gave
part of his salary, and several friends of his were
obliged to give something ‘for an act of charity’.
It was impossible for him to gather together the
hundred pesos, so he was able to send the farmer
only a little more than half. He put the money in an
envelope addressed to Lencho and with it a letter
containing only a single word as a signature: God.
Oral Comprehension Check

2. Who read the letter?
3. What did the postmaster do then?

The following Sunday Lencho came a bit earlier
than usual to ask if there was a letter for him.
It was the postman himself who handed the letter
to him while the postmaster, experiencing the
contentment of a man who has performed a good contentment
satisfaction
deed, looked on from his office.
Lencho showed not the slightest surprise on
seeing the money; such was his confidence — but
he became angry when he counted the money. God
could not have made a mistake, nor could he have
denied Lencho what he had requested.
Immediately, Lencho went up to the window to
ask for paper and ink. On the public writing-table,
he started to write, with much wrinkling of his brow,
caused by the effort he had to make to express his
ideas. When he finished, he went to the window to
buy a stamp which he licked and then affixed to

the envelope with a blow of his fist. The moment
the letter fell into the mailbox the postmaster went
to open it. It said: “God: Of the money that I asked
for, only seventy pesos reached me. Send me the
rest, since I need it very much. But don’t send it to
me through the mail because the post office
employees are a bunch of crooks. Lencho.”

I. Look at the following sentence from the story.
Suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large
hailstones began to fall.

First Flight

‘Hailstones’ are small balls of ice that fall like rain. A storm in which
hailstones fall is a ‘hailstorm’. You know that a storm is bad weather with
strong winds, rain, thunder and lightning.
There are different names in different parts of the world for storms,
depending on their nature. Can you match the names in the box with
their descriptions below, and fill in the blanks? You may use a dictionary
to help you.

Ocean: __ __ r __ __ __ __ __ __
6. A very strong wind that moves very fast in a spinning movement and

II. Notice how the word ‘hope’ is used in these sentences from the story:
(a) I hope it (the hailstorm) passes quickly.
(b) There was a single hope: help from God.
In the first example, ‘hope’ is a verb which means you wish for something to
happen. In the second example it is a noun meaning a chance for something
to happen.

III. Relative Clauses

Look at these sentences
(a) All morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately — looked at
the sky.
(b) The woman, who was preparing supper, replied, “Yes, God willing.’’

The relative clauses in (a) and (b) above are called non-defining, because
we already know the identity of the person they describe. Lencho is a
particular person, and there is a particular woman he speaks to. We don’t
need the information in the relative clause to pick these people out from a
larger set.
A non-defining relative clause usually has a comma in front of it and a
comma after it (some writers use a dash (—) instead, as in the story). If the
relative clause comes at the end, we just put a full stop.
Join the sentences given below using who, whom, whose, which, as
suggested.
1. I often go to Mumbai. Mumbai is the commercial capital of India. (which)
2. My mother is going to host a TV show on cooking. She cooks very
well. (who)

Reprint 2025-26

The italicised parts of the sentences give us more information about Lencho
and the woman. We call them relative clauses. Notice that they begin with
a relative pronoun who. Other common relative pronouns are whom, whose,
and which.

4. Lencho prayed to God. His eyes see into our minds. (whose)

Sometimes the relative pronoun in a relative clause remains ‘hidden’. For
example, look at the first sentence of the story:
(a) The house — the only one in the entire valley — sat on the crest of a
low hill.
We can rewrite this sentence as:
(b) The house — which was the only one in the entire valley — sat on
the crest of a low hill.
In (a), the relative pronoun which and the verb was are not present.

IV. Using Negatives for Emphasis

10

We know that sentences with words such as no, not or nothing show the
absence of something, or contradict something. For example:
(a) This year we will have no corn. (Corn will be absent)
(b) The hail has left nothing. (Absence of a crop)
(c) These aren’t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.
(Contradicts the common idea of what the drops of water falling from
the sky are)
But sometims negative words are used just to emphasise an idea. Look at
these sentences from the story:
(d) Lencho…had done nothing else but see the sky towards the northeast. (He had done only this)
(e) The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of
feeling the rain on his body. (He had only this reason)
(f) Lencho showed not the slightest surprise on seeing the money.
(He showed no surprise at all)
Now look back at example (c). Notice that the contradiction in fact serves to
emphasise the value or usefulness of the rain to the farmer.
Find sentences in the story with negative words, which express the
following ideas emphatically.
1. The trees lost all their leaves.

2. The letter was addressed to God himself.

3. The postman saw this address for the first time in his career.

V. Metaphors
The word metaphor comes from a Greek word meaning ‘transfer’. Metaphors
compare two things or ideas: a quality or feature of one thing is transferred
to another thing. Some common metaphors are
• the leg of the table: The leg supports our body. So the object that supports
a table is described as a leg.
• the heart of the city: The heart is an important organ in the centre of our
body. So this word is used to describe the central area of a city.
In pairs, find metaphors from the story to complete the table below. Try
to say what qualities are being compared. One has been done for you.

WHAT WE HAVE DONE
• Introduced students to the story that they are going to read.
• Related a thought-provoking story about the nature of belief.
• Helped students, through an interesting activity, to understand something that
happens in the story — how to send money using a money order.
• Guided them through the reading activity by providing periodic comprehension checks
as they read, and checked for holistic understanding at the end of the reading activity.
• Provided interesting exercises to strengthen students’ grasp of the specific vocabulary
found in the story, and also introduced them to related vocabulary.

Dear Arti,
How are you? I’m sorry I haven’t written for a very long time. I think I last
sent you a birthday card in the month of September 2005.
We have just moved house (see our new address above). This is our new

‘Little Feet’ as this is very close to our new home.
I’m sitting here by the window sill, writing to you. There is a slight drizzle outside

Do write back. Love,

WHAT YOU CAN D O
Before You Read : Encourage students to share their ideas about what will happen in the
story.
Activity : Before filling out the form, get the students to read through the form and
decide which parts they should fill out, and which parts will be filled in by the postal
department. Ask a few students to volunteer to actually send a money order (the
amount need not be large) and share the experience with the rest of the class.

Grammar: After they have done the exercise, ask students to make their own sentences
with non-defining relative clauses — for example, ‘Meena, who’s a very clever girl, is
always first in class.’ Or, ‘Our gardener, who knows a lot about plants, loves to talk
about them.’
Speaking: Take the first turn — talk to the students about an instance from your own
life, or from that of someone you know.

Reading: Break the text up into manageable chunks for reading (three paragraphs, for
example), and encourage students to read silently, on their own. Give them enough
time to read, and then discuss what they have read before going on to the next portion.
Use the ‘Oral Comprehension Checks’ in the appropriate places, and use the ‘Thinking
about the Text’ questions at the end of the passage to help them go beyond the text.

Dust of Sno
Snow

The way a crow
Shook down on me
The dust of snow
From a hemlock tree
Has given my heart
A change of mood
And saved some part
Of a day I had rued.

ROBERT FROST

hemlock: A poisonous plant (tree) with small white flowers
rued: held in regret

This poem presents a moment that seems simple, but has a larger significance.
[Compare this other quotation from Robert Frost: “Always, always a larger
significance... A little thing touches a larger thing.”)
1. What is a “dust of snow”? What does the poet say has changed his mood?
How has the poet’s mood changed?
2. How does Frost present nature in this poem? The following questions may
help you to think of an answer.
(i) What are the birds that are usually named in poems? Do you think a
crow is often mentioned in poems? What images come to your mind
when you think of a crow?
(ii) Again, what is “a hemlock tree”? Why doesn’t the poet write about a
more ‘beautiful’ tree such as a maple, or an oak, or a pine?
(iii) What do the ‘crow’ and ‘hemlock’ represent — joy or sorrow? What does
the dust of snow that the crow shakes off a hemlock tree stand for?
3. Have there been times when you felt depressed or hopeless? Have you
experienced a similar moment that changed your mood that day?

Some say the world will end in fire
Some say in ice.
From what I’ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favour fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.

ROBERT FROST

perish: die
suffice: be sufficient

1. There are many ideas about how the world will ‘end’. Do you think the world
will end some day? Have you ever thought what would happen if the sun got
so hot that it ‘burst’, or grew colder and colder?
2. For Frost, what do ‘fire’ and ‘ice’ stand for? Here are some ideas:
greed

avarice

cruelty

lust

conflict

fury

intolerance

rigidity

insensitivity

In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial
substance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical
and chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical
change occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.
You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a
chemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction
has taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to
these questions.

Activity 1.1 can be described as – when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in
oxygen, it gets converted to magnesium oxide. This description of a
chemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a
shorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a
word-equation.
The word-equation for the above reaction would be –
Magnesium + Oxygen
(Reactants)

→ Magnesium oxide

(1.1)

(Product)

The substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),
magnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is
magnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.
A word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an
arrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand
side (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are
written on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.
The arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of
the reaction.

1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation
Is there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?
Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use
chemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a
chemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and
magnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –
Mg + O2 → MgO

(1.2)

Count and compare the number of atoms of each element on the
LHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the
same on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,
then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on
both sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal
chemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical
equation for the burning of magnesium in air.

1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations
Recall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass
can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the
total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction
has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.
In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the
same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a
skeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us
learn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.
The word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as –
Zinc + Sulphuric acid → Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen
The above word-equation may be represented by the following
chemical equation –
Zn + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2

Step I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each
formula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the
equation.

Step III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound
that contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a
product. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum
number of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element
oxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on
the LHS.
To balance the oxygen atoms –

To equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we
cannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the
reactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient
‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation
becomes –
(1.6)
Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2
(partly balanced equation)
Step IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements
to proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced
equation.
To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules
of hydrogen as four on the RHS.

which is not balanced. You find that only one element is left to be

To equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS.
3 Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + 4 H2

(1.8)

Step VI: Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we
count atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.
(1.9)

3Fe + 4H2O → Fe3O4 + 4H2

(balanced equation)

The numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are
equal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical
equations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance
the equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.
Step VII: Writing Symbols of Physical States Carefully examine
the above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about
the physical state of each reactant and product? No information has
been given in this equation about their physical states.
To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states
of the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical
formulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants
and products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),
respectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product
is present as a solution in water.
The balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes
3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)

(1.10)

Note that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this
reaction water is used in the form of steam.
Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless
it is necessary to specify them.
Sometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,
catalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow
in the equation. For example –
340 atm

(1.11)

CO(g) + 2H2 (g) 
→ CH3 OH(l)

6CO2 (aq) + 12H2O(l) 
Chlorophyll → C6 H12O 6 (aq) + 6O2 (aq) + 6H2 O(l) (1.12)

We have learnt in Class IX that during a chemical reaction atoms of one
element do not change into those of another element. Nor do atoms
disappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical
reactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to
produce new substances. You will study about types of bonds formed
between atoms in Chapters 3 and 4.

Do You Know?

A solution of slaked lime produced by the reaction 1.13 is used for whitewashing
walls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin
layer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is formed after two to
three days of whitewashing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note
that the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO3.

Formation of water from H2(g) and O2(g)

In simple language we can say that when two or more substances
(elements or compounds) combine to form a single product, the reactions
are called combination reactions.
In Activity 1.4, we also observed that a large amount of heat is evolved.
This makes the reaction mixture warm. Reactions in which heat is
released along with the formation of products are called exothermic
chemical reactions.
Other examples of exothermic reactions are –
(i) Burning of natural gas
CH4(g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g)
(ii)

(1.17)

Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process?

We all know that we need energy to stay alive. We get this energy
from the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler
substances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain
carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose.
This glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides
energy. The special name of this reaction is respiration, the process of
which you will study in Chapter 6.
C6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(aq) → 6CO2(aq) + 6H2O(l) + energy

(Ferric oxide)

In this reaction you can observe that a single reactant breaks down
to give simpler products. This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous
sulphate crystals (FeSO4. 7H2O) lose water when heated and the colour
of the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide (Fe2O3),
sulphur dioxide (SO2) and sulphur trioxide (SO3). Ferric oxide is a solid,
while SO2 and SO3 are gases.
Decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon
dioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in
various industries. Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has
many uses – one is in the manufacture of cement. When a decomposition
reaction is carried out by heating, it is called thermal decomposition.

Oxidation of copper to
copper oxide

Heat a china dish containing about 1 g
copper powder (Fig. 1.10).
What do you observe?

The surface of copper powder becomes coated with
black copper(II) oxide. Why has this black
substance formed?
This is because oxygen is added to copper and
copper oxide is formed.
Heat

2Cu + O2 

If hydrogen gas is passed over this heated material (CuO), the black


CuO +H 2 Heat
→ Cu + H2 O
If a substance gains oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be oxidised.
If a substance loses oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be reduced.
During this reaction (1.29), the copper(II) oxide is losing oxygen and
is being reduced. The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised.
In other words, one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced
during a reaction. Such reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions
or redox reactions.

(1.30)
Some other examples of redox reactions are:

ZnO + C → Zn + CO

In reaction (1.31) carbon is oxidised to CO and ZnO is reduced to Zn.
In reaction (1.32) HCl is oxidised to Cl2 whereas MnO2 is reduced to MnCl2.
From the above examples we can say that if a substance gains oxygen
or loses hydrogen during a reaction, it is oxidised. If a substance loses
oxygen or gains hydrogen during a reaction, it is reduced.

1.3.1 Corrosion
You must have observed that iron articles are shiny when new, but get
coated with a reddish brown powder when left for some time. This process
is commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get
tarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating
formed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances
around it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this
process is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green
coating on copper are other examples of corrosion.
Corrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships
and to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of
iron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is
spent to replace damaged iron. You will learn more about corrosion in
Chapter 3.

1.3.2 Rancidity
Have you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left
for a long time?
When fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell
and taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation
(antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food
in air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that
chips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as
nitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?

A complete chemical equation represents the reactants, products and their physical
states symbolically.
A chemical equation is balanced so that the numbers of atoms of each type involved
in a chemical reaction are the same on the reactant and product sides of the
equation. Equations must always be balanced.
In a combination reaction two or more substances combine to form a new single
substance.
Decomposition reactions are opposite to combination reactions. In a decomposition
reaction, a single substance decomposes to give two or more substances.
Reactions in which heat is given out along with the products are called exothermic
reactions.
Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions.
When an element displaces another element from its compound, a displacement
reaction occurs.
Two different atoms or groups of atoms (ions) are exchanged in double displacement
reactions.
Precipitation reactions produce insoluble salts.
Reactions also involve the gain or loss of oxygen or hydrogen by substances.
Oxidation is the gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen. Reduction is the loss of oxygen

Mandela Becomes South Africa’s First Black President
Nelson Mandela has become South Africa’s first Black
President after more than three centuries of White rule.
Mr Mandela’s African National Congress (ANC) party won
252 of the 400 seats in the first democratic elections of South
Africa’s history.
The inauguration ceremony took place in the Union
Buildings amphitheatre in Pretoria today, attended by
politicians and dignitaries from more than 140 countries
around the world. “Never, never again will this beautiful land
experience the oppression of one by another, ” said Nelson
Mandela in his address.
… Jubilant scenes on the streets of Pretoria followed the
ceremony with blacks, whites and coloureds celebrating
together... More than 100,000 South African men, women
and children of all races sang and danced with joy.

Nelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom

TENTH May dawned bright and clear. For the past
few days I had been pleasantly besieged by
dignitaries and world leaders who were coming to
pay their respects before the inauguration. The
inauguration would be the largest gathering ever of
international leaders on South African soil.
The ceremonies took place in the lovely
sandstone amphitheatre formed by the Union
Buildings in Pretoria. For decades this had been
the seat of white supremacy, and now it was the
site of a rainbow gathering of different colours and
nations for the installation of South Africa’s first
democratic, non-racial government.
On that lovely autumn day I was accompanied
by my daughter Zenani. On the podium, Mr de Klerk
was first sworn in as second deputy president. Then

First Flight

Thabo Mbeki was sworn in as first deputy president.
When it was my turn, I pledged to obey and uphold

assembled guests and the watching world, I said:

Today, all of us do, by our presence here... confer glory

an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long,
must be born a society of which all humanity will

the world on our own soil. We thank all of our
distinguished international guests for having come to
take possession with the people of our country of what
is, after all, a common victory for justice, for peace, for
human dignity.
We have, at last, achieved our political emancipation.
We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the
continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering,
gender and other discrimination.
Never, never, and never again shall it be that this
beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one
by another.
The sun shall never set on so glorious a human
achievement.
Let freedom reign. God bless Africa!

Nelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom

A few moments later we all lifted our eyes in
awe as a spectacular array of South African jets,
helicopters and troop carriers roared in perfect
formation over the Union Buildings. It was not only
a display of pinpoint precision and military force,
but a demonstration of the military’s loyalty to
democracy, to a new government that had been
freely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the
highest generals of the South African defence force
and police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and
medals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged
their loyalty. I was not unmindful of the fact that
not so many years before they would not have
saluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala
jets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue
and gold of the new South African flag.
The day was symbolised for me by the playing of
our two national anthems, and the vision of whites
singing ‘Nkosi Sikelel –iAfrika’ and blacks singing
‘Die Stem’, the old anthem of the Republic. Although
that day neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem
they once despised, they would soon know the
words by heart.
On the day of the inauguration, I was
overwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first
decade of the twentieth century, a few years after
the bitter Anglo-Boer war and before my own birth,
the white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched
up their differences and erected a system of racial
domination against the dark-skinned peoples of their
own land. The structure they created formed the
basis of one of the harshest, most inhumane,
societies the world has ever known. Now, in the
last decade of the twentieth century, and my own
eighth decade as a man, that system had been

First Flight

overturned forever and replaced by one that
recognised the rights and freedoms of all peoples,
regardless of the colour of their skin.
That day had come about through the
unimaginable sacrifices of thousands of my people,
people whose suffering and courage can never be
counted or repaid. I felt that day, as I have on so
many other days, that I was simply the sum of all
those African patriots who had gone before me. That
long and noble line ended and now began again
with me. I was pained that I was not able to thank
them and that they were not able to see what their
sacrifices had wrought.
The policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting
wound in my country and my people. All of us will
spend many years, if not generations, recovering
from that profound hurt. But the decades of
oppression and brutality had another, unintended,
effect, and that was that it produced the Oliver
Tambos, the Walter Sisulus, the Chief Luthulis, the
Yusuf Dadoos, the Bram Fischers, the Robert

courage, wisdom and generosity that their like may
never be known again. Perhaps it requires such
depths of oppression to create such heights of
character. My country is rich in the minerals and
gems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always
known that its greatest wealth is its people, finer
and truer than the purest diamonds.
It is from these comrades in the struggle that I
learned the meaning of courage. Time and again, I
have seen men and women risk and give their lives
for an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks
and torture without breaking, showing a strength
and resilience that defies the imagination. I learned
that courage was not the absence of fear, but the
triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does
not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.
No one is born hating another person because of
the colour of his skin, or his background, or his
religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can
learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love
comes more naturally to the human heart than its
opposite. Even in the grimmest times in prison, when
my comrades and I were pushed to our limits, I would
see a glimmer of humanity in one of the guards,
perhaps just for a second, but it was enough to
reassure me and keep me going. Man’s goodness is
a flame that can be hidden but never extinguished.

society, each man is able to fulfil those obligations
according to his own inclinations and abilities. But
in a country like South Africa, it was almost
impossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil
both of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of
colour who attempted to live as a human being was
punished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who
tried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably
ripped from his family and his home and was forced
to live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy
and rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to
place my people above my family, but in attempting
to serve my people, I found that I was prevented
from fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a
father and a husband.
I was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born
free — free in every way that I could know. Free to
run in the fields near my mother’s hut, free to swim
in the clear stream that ran through my village, free
to roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad
backs of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my
father and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was
not troubled by the laws of man or God.
It was only when I began to learn that my boyhood
freedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a
young man that my freedom had already been taken
from me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a
student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the
transitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night,
read what I pleased and go where I chose. Later, as
a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the
basic and honourable freedoms of achieving my
potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and
having a family — the freedom not to be obstructed
in a lawful life.
But then I slowly saw that not only was I not
free, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I
saw that it was not just my freedom that was
curtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked
like I did. That is when I joined the African National
Congress, and that is when the hunger for my own
freedom became the greater hunger for the freedom

of my people. It was this desire for the freedom of
my people to live their lives with dignity and selfrespect that animated my life, that transformed a
frightened young man into a bold one, that drove a
law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that
turned a family-loving husband into a man without
a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a
monk. I am no more virtuous or self-sacrificing
than the next man, but I found that I could not
even enjoy the poor and limited freedoms I was
allowed when I knew my people were not free.
Freedom is indivisible; the chains on anyone of
my people were the chains on all of them, the
chains on all of my people were the chains on me.
I knew that the oppressor must be liberated just
as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away
another man’s freedom is a prisoner of hatred; he is
locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrowmindedness. I am not truly free if I am taking away
someone else’s freedom, just as surely as I am not
free when my freedom is taken from me. The oppressed
and the oppressor alike are robbed of their humanity.

II. Using the Definite Article with Names
You know that the definite article ‘the’ is not normally used before proper
nouns. Nor do proper nouns usually occur in the plural. (We do not say:
*The Nelson Mandela, or *Nelson Mandelas.) But now look at this sentence
from the text:

25

… the decades of oppression and brutality … produced the Oliver Tambos,
the Walter Sisulus, … of our time.
Used in this way with the and/or in the plural, a proper noun carries a
special meaning. For example, what do you think the names above mean?
Choose the right answer.
(b) many other men like Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu …/many men of
their type or kind, whose names may not be as well known.
Did you choose option (b)? Then you have the right answer!
Here are some more examples of ‘the’ used with proper names. Try to
say what these sentences mean. (You may consult a dictionary if you
wish. Look at the entry for ‘the’.)
1. Mr Singh regularly invites the Amitabh Bachchans and the Shah Rukh
Khans to his parties.

habitat. The poem moves from the zoo to the jungle, and back again
to the zoo. Read the poem silently once, and say which stanzas
speak about the tiger in the zoo, and which ones speak about the
tiger in the jungle.

He stalks in his vivid stripes
The few steps of his cage,
On pads of velvet quiet,
In his quiet rage.
He should be lurking in shadow,
Sliding through long grass
Near the water hole
Where plump deer pass.
He should be snarling around houses
At the jungle’s edge,
Baring his white fangs, his claws,
Terrorising the village!
But he’s locked in a concrete cell,
His strength behind bars,
Stalking the length of his cage,
Ignoring visitors.
He hears the last voice at night,
The patrolling cars,
And stares with his brilliant eyes
At the brilliant stars.

(i) Find the words that describe the movements and actions of the tiger in
the cage and in the wild. Arrange them in two columns.
(ii) Find the words that describe the two places, and arrange them in two
columns.
Now try to share ideas about how the poet uses words and images to contrast
the two situations.

3. Read the following two poems — one about a tiger and the other about a
panther. Then discuss:
Are zoos necessary for the protection or conservation of some species of
animals? Are they useful for educating the public? Are there alternatives
to zoos?

The Tiger
The tiger behind the bars of his cage growls,
The tiger behind the bars of his cage snarls,
The tiger behind the bars of his cage roars.
Then he thinks.
It would be nice not to be behind bars all
The time
Because they spoil my view
I wish I were wild, not on show.
But if I were wild, hunters might shoot me,
But if I were wild, food might poison me,
But if I were wild, water might drown me.
Then he stops thinking
And...
The tiger behind the bars of his cage growls,
The tiger behind the bars of his cage snarls,
The tiger behind the bars of his cage roars.

The Panther
His vision, from the constantly passing bars,
has grown so weary that it cannot hold
anything else. It seems to him there are
a thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.
As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,
the movement of his powerful soft strides
is like a ritual dance around a centre
in which a mighty will stands paralysed.
Only at times, the curtain of the pupils
lifts, quietly. An image enters in,
rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,
plunges into the heart and is gone.

They say faith can move mountains. But what should we put our
faith in? This is the question this story delicately poses.
Lencho is a farmer who writes a letter to God when his crops
are ruined, asking for a hundred pesos. Does Lencho’s letter reach
God? Does God send him the money? Think what your answers to
these questions would be, and guess how the story continues, before
you begin to read it.

A Letter to God

THE house — the only one in the entire valley — sat
on the crest of a low hill. From this height one crest
could see the river and the field of ripe corn dotted top of a hill
with the flowers that always promised a good
harvest. The only thing the earth needed was a
downpour or at least a shower. Throughout the
morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately
— had done nothing else but see the sky towards
the north-east.
“Now we’re really going to get some water, woman.”
The woman who was preparing supper, replied,
“Yes, God willing”. The older boys were working in
the field, while the smaller ones were playing near
the house until the woman called to them all, “Come
for dinner”. It was during the meal that, just as

First Flight

Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to
fall. In the north-east huge mountains of clouds
could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and
sweet. The man went out for no other reason than
to have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body,
and when he returned he exclaimed, ‘‘These aren’t
raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.
The big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones
are fives.’’
With a satisfied expression he regarded the field
of ripe corn with its flowers, draped in a curtain of
rain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow
and along with the rain very large hailstones began
to fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins.
The boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out
to collect the frozen pearls.
‘‘It’s really getting bad now,’’ exclaimed the man.
“I hope it passes quickly.” It did not pass quickly.
For an hour the hail rained on the house, the
garden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole
valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.
Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was
totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the
plants. Lencho’s soul was filled with sadness. When
the storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the
field and said to his sons, “A plague of locusts would

‘‘There’s no one who can help us.”
“We’ll all go hungry this year.”

A Letter to God

But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary
house in the middle of the valley, there was a single
hope: help from God.
“Don’t be so upset, even though this seems like
a total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.”
“That’s what they say: no one dies of hunger.”
All through the night, Lencho thought only of
his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he
had been instructed, see everything, even what is
deep in one’s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a
man, working like an animal in the fields, but still
he knew how to write. The following Sunday, at
daybreak, he began to write a letter which he
himself would carry to town and place in the mail.
It was nothing less than a letter to God.
“God,” he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family
and I will go hungry this year. I need a hundred
pesos in order to sow my field again and to live
until the crop comes, because the hailstorm... .”
He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter
inside and, still troubled, went to town. At the post
office, he placed a stamp on the letter and dropped
it into the mailbox.
One of the employees, who was a postman and
also helped at the post office, went to his boss
laughing heartily and showed him the letter to God.
Never in his career as a postman had he known
that address. The postmaster — a fat, amiable

First Flight
6

fellow — also broke out laughing, but almost
immediately he turned serious and, tapping the
letter on his desk, commented, “What faith! I wish I
had the faith of the man who wrote this letter.
Starting up a correspondence with God!”
So, in order not to shake the writer’s faith in God,
the postmaster came up with an idea: answer the
letter. But when he opened it, it was evident that to
answer it he needed something more than goodwill,
ink and paper. But he stuck to his resolution: he
asked for money from his employees, he himself gave
part of his salary, and several friends of his were
obliged to give something ‘for an act of charity’.
It was impossible for him to gather together the
hundred pesos, so he was able to send the farmer
only a little more than half. He put the money in an
envelope addressed to Lencho and with it a letter
containing only a single word as a signature: God.
Oral Comprehension Check
1. Who or what did Lencho have faith in? What did he do?
2. Who read the letter?
3. What did the postmaster do then?

The following Sunday Lencho came a bit earlier
than usual to ask if there was a letter for him.
It was the postman himself who handed the letter
to him while the postmaster, experiencing the
contentment of a man who has performed a good contentment
satisfaction
deed, looked on from his office.
Lencho showed not the slightest surprise on
seeing the money; such was his confidence — but
he became angry when he counted the money. God
could not have made a mistake, nor could he have
denied Lencho what he had requested.
Immediately, Lencho went up to the window to
ask for paper and ink. On the public writing-table,
he started to write, with much wrinkling of his brow,
caused by the effort he had to make to express his
ideas. When he finished, he went to the window to
buy a stamp which he licked and then affixed to

the envelope with a blow of his fist. The moment
the letter fell into the mailbox the postmaster went
to open it. It said: “God: Of the money that I asked
for, only seventy pesos reached me. Send me the
rest, since I need it very much. But don’t send it to
me through the mail because the post office
employees are a bunch of crooks. Lencho.”

6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story: between humans and nature,

I. Look at the following sentence from the story.
Suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large
hailstones began to fall.

First Flight

‘Hailstones’ are small balls of ice that fall like rain. A storm in which
hailstones fall is a ‘hailstorm’. You know that a storm is bad weather with
strong winds, rain, thunder and lightning.
There are different names in different parts of the world for storms,
depending on their nature. Can you match the names in the box with
their descriptions below, and fill in the blanks? You may use a dictionary

Ocean: __ __ r __ __ __ __ __ __
6. A very strong wind that moves very fast in a spinning movement and

II. Notice how the word ‘hope’ is used in these sentences from the story:
(a) I hope it (the hailstorm) passes quickly.
(b) There was a single hope: help from God.
In the first example, ‘hope’ is a verb which means you wish for something to
happen. In the second example it is a noun meaning a chance for something
to happen.

III. Relative Clauses

9

Look at these sentences
(a) All morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately — looked at
the sky.
(b) The woman, who was preparing supper, replied, “Yes, God willing.’’

The relative clauses in (a) and (b) above are called non-defining, because
we already know the identity of the person they describe. Lencho is a
particular person, and there is a particular woman he speaks to. We don’t
need the information in the relative clause to pick these people out from a
larger set.
A non-defining relative clause usually has a comma in front of it and a
comma after it (some writers use a dash (—) instead, as in the story). If the
relative clause comes at the end, we just put a full stop.
Join the sentences given below using who, whom, whose, which, as
suggested.
1. I often go to Mumbai. Mumbai is the commercial capital of India. (which)
2. My mother is going to host a TV show on cooking. She cooks very
well. (who)

Reprint 2025-26

A Letter to God

The italicised parts of the sentences give us more information about Lencho
and the woman. We call them relative clauses. Notice that they begin with
a relative pronoun who. Other common relative pronouns are whom, whose,
and which.

3. These sportspersons are going to meet the President. Their performance
has been excellent. (whose)
4. Lencho prayed to God. His eyes see into our minds. (whose)
5. This man cheated me. I trusted him. (whom)
Sometimes the relative pronoun in a relative clause remains ‘hidden’. For
example, look at the first sentence of the story:
(a) The house — the only one in the entire valley — sat on the crest of a
low hill.
We can rewrite this sentence as:
(b) The house — which was the only one in the entire valley — sat on
the crest of a low hill.
In (a), the relative pronoun which and the verb was are not present.

First Flight

IV. Using Negatives for Emphasis

10

We know that sentences with words such as no, not or nothing show the
absence of something, or contradict something. For example:
(a) This year we will have no corn. (Corn will be absent)
(b) The hail has left nothing. (Absence of a crop)
(c) These aren’t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.
(Contradicts the common idea of what the drops of water falling from
the sky are)
But sometims negative words are used just to emphasise an idea. Look at
these sentences from the story:
(d) Lencho…had done nothing else but see the sky towards the northeast. (He had done only this)
(e) The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of
feeling the rain on his body. (He had only this reason)
(f) Lencho showed not the slightest surprise on seeing the money.
(He showed no surprise at all)
Now look back at example (c). Notice that the contradiction in fact serves to
emphasise the value or usefulness of the rain to the farmer.
Find sentences in the story with negative words, which express the
following ideas emphatically.
1. The trees lost all their leaves.

2. The letter was addressed to God himself.

3. The postman saw this address for the first time in his career.

Reprint 2025-26

V. Metaphors
The word metaphor comes from a Greek word meaning ‘transfer’. Metaphors
compare two things or ideas: a quality or feature of one thing is transferred
to another thing. Some common metaphors are
• the leg of the table: The leg supports our body. So the object that supports
a table is described as a leg.
• the heart of the city: The heart is an important organ in the centre of our
body. So this word is used to describe the central area of a city.
In pairs, find metaphors from the story to complete the table below. Try
to say what qualities are being compared. One has been done for you.

Activity : Before filling out the form, get the students to read through the form and
decide which parts they should fill out, and which parts will be filled in by the postal
department. Ask a few students to volunteer to actually send a money order (the
amount need not be large) and share the experience with the rest of the class.

Grammar: After they have done the exercise, ask students to make their own sentences
with non-defining relative clauses — for example, ‘Meena, who’s a very clever girl, is
always first in class.’ Or, ‘Our gardener, who knows a lot about plants, loves to talk
about them.’
Speaking: Take the first turn — talk to the students about an instance from your own
life, or from that of someone you know.

Reading: Break the text up into manageable chunks for reading (three paragraphs, for
example), and encourage students to read silently, on their own. Give them enough
time to read, and then discuss what they have read before going on to the next portion.
Use the ‘Oral Comprehension Checks’ in the appropriate places, and use the ‘Thinking
about the Text’ questions at the end of the passage to help them go beyond the text.

Dust of Sno
Snow
w
The way a crow
Shook down on me
The dust of snow
From a hemlock tree
Has given my heart
A change of mood
And saved some part
Of a day I had rued.

ROBERT FROST

hemlock: A poisonous plant (tree) with small white flowers
rued: held in regret

This poem presents a moment that seems simple, but has a larger significance.
[Compare this other quotation from Robert Frost: “Always, always a larger
significance... A little thing touches a larger thing.”)
1. What is a “dust of snow”? What does the poet say has changed his mood?
How has the poet’s mood changed?
2. How does Frost present nature in this poem? The following questions may
help you to think of an answer.
(i) What are the birds that are usually named in poems? Do you think a
crow is often mentioned in poems? What images come to your mind
when you think of a crow?
(ii) Again, what is “a hemlock tree”? Why doesn’t the poet write about a
more ‘beautiful’ tree such as a maple, or an oak, or a pine?
(iii) What do the ‘crow’ and ‘hemlock’ represent — joy or sorrow? What does
the dust of snow that the crow shakes off a hemlock tree stand for?
3. Have there been times when you felt depressed or hopeless? Have you
experienced a similar moment that changed your mood that day?

Fire and Ice
Some say the world will end in fire
Some say in ice.
From what I’ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favour fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.

ROBERT FROST

perish: die
suffice: be sufficient

1. There are many ideas about how the world will ‘end’. Do you think the world
will end some day? Have you ever thought what would happen if the sun got
so hot that it ‘burst’, or grew colder and colder?
2. For Frost, what do ‘fire’ and ‘ice’ stand for? Here are some ideas:
greed

avarice

cruelty

lust

conflict

fury

intolerance

rigidity

insensitivity

coldness

indifference

hatred

3. What is the rhyme scheme of the poem? How does it help in bringing out the
contrasting ideas in the poem?

the morning. Neha makes a face and covering her ears with a
pillow, snuggles under the warm blanket. But she knows she
has to get up. She mutters to herself.
Neha This alarm clock always rings at six and pulls me out

Unit 1
Poem: Wake up!
Story: Neha's Alarm Clock
This Unit focuses on appreciation of the beauty in nature, the magic of words and to give
children experiences in expressing their feelings. This Unit is also a listening Unit - it gives
children something to listen to as you read the poem to them. Ask children why they like the
poem and read the poem again for interesting and beautiful sounds. Begin this Unit by
pointing to the pictures and ask children what beautiful colours they see. Provide a print
rich environment.
Warm up
It is important to do warm up exercises related to the theme, like, let children stretch their
arms, exercise and jog as if to wake up wide. Relate this to the natural beauty of the morning.
Reading time
Read the chapter to the students at a stretch, giving the meanings of the new and difficult
words so that they can understand the text. Use appropriate words, expressions, phrases in
different situations. This can help you to assess the child's ability to listen with attention
for a reasonable length of time, share the main idea of the text and accelerate recall skills.
Give the children a chance to read individually.
Sharing time
Involve the class in a group reading session. Let children add meaning with voice
modulation and body gestures.
Dramatise the play for the morning assembly. Let each child express what they feel when
they have to get up in the morning.
Team time
Play memory games. You can write down ten new words from the lesson on the
blackboard. Let the children look at the words for two minutes. Ask the children to close
their eyes. You can then erase one word. The children will then open their eyes and
identify the word that has been erased.
Since breakfast is important for good health, each child could be asked what he had for
breakfast. Then ask them to give the importance of milk, lassi, butter. Let them add what
they eat will like to eat.
Discuss the importance of time and punctuality with the class. While discussing other
ways of finding time, the sun dial, shadows and position of sun can be introduced.
Environment
Create a Junior Green Brigade as a group of keen environmentalists who assist in keeping
the school green and clean; they can be actively involved in successful projects against
crackers and banning the use of polybags in the school and community. The school can
encourage cloth bags which are an attractive and environment-friendly alternative to
plastic.

A big bright tear splashed down her nose. And another.
A kingfisher swept down, its wings an arrow of blue in the
sunlight. And a green lizard slithered down to the river’s edge
to bask in the sun.
“Dear, dear!” said a sleepy, murmuring voice, “What’s the
matter?”
Jahnavi was startled, because she was sure she had been quite
alone. It couldn’t have been the lizard. And the kingfisher was
up in the thicket of bamboo eating the fish it had caught. It
couldn’t be the parrots, because parrots shrieked and this was
such a sleepy voice. She looked around her. There wasn’t a
soul in sight. She was rather scared and wanted to run away.
“You shouldn’t cry, you know,” the voice went on. “And you
really shouldn’t be scared, when you have been coming here
to see me every day, well, almost every day.”

She was puzzled. It was such a voice, like
the river. It couldn’t be the river!
“Well, tell me all about it,” said the River,
for it was the River. “I’ve got to hurry to reach
the sea, you know.”
“They won’t let me go to school,” said Jahnavi.
“I asked my mother, ‘Why can’t I go to school
like Ettan and Meena?’ And Mother had
replied, ‘You are too small, baby. Maybe
later.’ ” But when she was five, little
Ramu was born and Mother still said,
“Maybe next year. Jahnavi, mind your
little brother while I go to the fields.”
Now, she was nearly ten and minding
Little Appu, who was the smallest. “They
don’t want me. They only...”—she stopped with a sob...
“I am scared to go to school. And I’m so old now, they’ll never
let me go. But I want to go. I want to learn to read like Ettan
and Meena.” Jahnavi called her brother ‘Ettan’. Ettan means
‘Elder brother’, but his real name was Gopi. “I want to know
why spiders are yellow in yellow flowers, why bamboo
trees rustle, why the moon always comes from
behind the hills, never the other way, why
the baby fish in the field water become
frogs, why...”
“Stop!” said the River. “You make me
breathless. So many whys! I can tell
you where the moon goes,” the River
said conspiratorially. “It goes down
towards the sea. I’ve seen; it always
takes the same way—over the
mountains and down to the sea,
like me!”

“Even little Ramu goes to school,” said Jahnavi, “pity, the school
isn’t by the sea,” said the River. “Then I could take you along,
you know. But, I suppose I couldn’t really. You’d get your feet
wet. And that would never do! I’m afraid there’s only one thing
you can do.”
“Can I do something?” asked Jahnavi. “Well, it’s up to you,”
said the River. “Seems to me little girls can do as much as little
boys—they swim as fast as little boys. You just slip along one
morning and sit there in the school and listen to what’s going
on, and maybe the teacher will let you stay.”
“I couldn’t,” gasped Jahnavi. “I couldn’t! They’d scare me!
They’d chase me out.”
The River laughed. “You? Scared?” the River said, “when you’re
not afraid of the green lizard, or of the snake in the bamboo
clump, (Jahnavi startled) or the big trains rattling past that
bridge.” “Trains are noisy; I prefer ships,” said the River.
Jahnavi never knew the snake lived in the bamboo clump.
“What are ships?” she asked.
“Big boats,” said the River, “so big that they can take hundreds
of people, and they sail along the sea with lights that shine all
night.”
Jahnavi held her breath. “Will they come here?” she asked.
“I’m afraid not,” said the River. “Too large, you know. Chandu’s
catamaran is good enough for me. Chandu can take you to see
a ship, someday.”
“They’d never let me!” wailed Jahnavi.
“Try going to school first,” said the River. “Remember—it’s up
to you!”

Jahnavi gathered courage. The next day she reached the school,
panting and out of breath and stood by the door listening while
the teacher read out the lesson. It was a story about a prince
called Asˊ hoka, who became a great king. Little Appu had fallen
asleep on her shoulder. She crept nearer and nearer till she was
in the back row, squatting with the others on the earthen floor.
Little Appu made no noise and she listened.
“Where did you spring from, little girl?” asked the teacher. “And
what is your name? You’re new in my class.”
“She’s Gopi’s sister, Gopi is in the next class,” said one of the boys.
“It’s Jahnavi,” said another. “So, you’re Gopi’s little sister? Nice
lad, Gopi.”
“If you really, really want to come to my school, Jahnavi,” the
teacher had said, “we’ll talk to your father about it. Don’t you
worry. We’ll find a way.”

Jahnavi saw the teacher walking up the steps to their gate the
next evening when she was lighting the lamp. She could see her
father scratching his cheek the way he did when he was worried
and the teacher was nodding and saying something she couldn’t
make out. And Mother said, “Little Jahnavi, I shall miss you when
you go to school. Girls should learn as much as they want. When I
was your age, I wanted to go to school, but your grandmother said
‘No’, but now, I am glad the teacher came to talk to your father.”

And Jahnavi said, “Mother, when I grow up, I’ll be
a teacher and I’ll go from house to house in our
village and ask all the little girls to come to my
school. And I’ll teach them all that I’m going to
learn.”
And she went down the path between the fields
the next morning before school began, to meet
the River. “I did it!” she told the River. “I was
scared, but I did it! And they’re letting me go. I’m
going to learn to write my name and do sums and
find out why our little fishes in the rice fields turn
into frogs.” She heard the river’s sleepy chuckle,
“Come again, little girl, and I’ll tell you all about
the ships that sail the sea.”

you. Over the next few days, pay attention to
the colours, shapes, patterns, and textures
found in nature. Look closely at the plants,
trees, flowers, birds, and even the sky. Make
detailed notes of what you observe, focusing on
textures, movements, and how light plays with
these elements. Record your observations in
detail and the features that draw your attention
the most—whether it’s the soft ripple of water,
the vibrant flutter of a butterfly or the colour of
the birds or flowers.

Let us read
King Bruce of Scotland flung himself down
In a lonely mood to think;
‘Tis true he was monarch, and wore a crown,
But his heart was beginning to sink.
For he had been trying to do a great deed,
To make his people glad;
He had tried and tried, but couldn’t succeed
And so he became quite sad.
He flung himself down in low despair,
As grieved as man could be;
And after a while he pondered there,
“I’ll give it all up,” said he.
Now just at that moment a spider dropped,
With its silken, filmy clue;
And the King, in the midst of his thinking, stopped
To see what the spider would do.
‘Twas a long way up to the ceiling dome,
And it hung by a rope so fine;
That how it would get to its cobweb home,
King Bruce could not divine.

It soon began to cling and crawl
Straight up with strong endeavour;
But down it came with a slippery sprawl,
As near to the ground as ever.
Up, up it ran, not a second to stay,
To utter the least complaint;
Till it fell still lower, and there it lay,
A little dizzy and faint.
Its head grew steady — again it went,
And travelled a half-yard higher;
‘Twas a delicate thread it had to tread,
And a road where its feet would tire.
Again it fell and swung below,
But again it quickly mounted;
Till up and down, now fast, now slow,
Nine brave attempts were counted.
“Sure,” cried the King, “that foolish thing
Will strive no more to climb;
When it toils so hard to reach and cling,
And tumbles every time.”
But up the insect went once more,
Ah me! ‘tis an anxious minute;
He’s only a foot from his cobweb door,
Oh say, will he lose or win it?
Steadily, steadily, inch by inch,
Higher and higher he got;
And a bold little run at the very last pinch
Put him into his native cot.
“Bravo, bravo!” the King cried out,
“All honour to those who try;
The spider up there, defied despair;
He conquered, and why shouldn’t I?”
And Bruce of Scotland braced his mind,
And gossips tell the tale,
That he tried once more as he tried before,
And that time did not fail.

VI The spider’s climbing is compared to King Bruce’s own
struggles. Just as the spider repeatedly attempts to reach its
web, Bruce is trying to achieve a great deed for his people.
This poetic device is called metaphor. It strengthens the poem’s message
about perseverance—keep trying till we succeed.
A metaphor is a figure of speech that involves an implied comparison
between two unlike things without using ‘like’, ‘as’, or ‘as...as’. It
suggests that one thing is another, highlighting similarities between
them to add deeper meaning or understanding.
1. Read the following sentences and identify metaphors and similes.
Write M for metaphor and S for simile.

The lake was a mirror, reflecting the sky.

2. Read the following sentences and transform the similes to metaphors
and metaphors to similes. Two examples have been given.

• His courage was as bright as a beacon guiding us through the
storm.
• His courage was like a beacon guiding us through the storm.

I, who cannot see, find hundreds of things to interest me

leaf. I pass my hands lovingly about
the smooth skin of a silver birch, or
the rough, shaggy bark of a pine. In
spring, I touch the branches of trees
hopefully in search of a bud, the first
sign of awakening Nature after her
winter’s sleep. Occasionally, I am very
fortunate; I place my hand gently on a
small tree and feel the happy quiver of
a bird in full song.

get so much pleasure from mere touch,
how much more beauty must be revealed by sight. And
I have imagined what I should most like to see if I were
given the use of my eyes, say, for just three days.
I should divide the period into three parts. On the first
day, I should want to see the people whose kindness and
companionship have made my life worth living. I do not
know what it is to see into the heart of a friend through
that ‘window of the soul’, the eye.

the same method can be applied to your other senses. Hear
the music of voice, the song of a bird, the mighty strains of an
orchestra, as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow. Touch
each object as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail. Smell
the perfume of flowers, taste with relish each morsel, as if
tomorrow you could never smell and taste again. Make the
most of every sense; glory in all the facets of pleasure and
beauty, which the world reveals to you through the several
means of contact, which Nature provides. But of all the senses,
I am sure that sight must be the most delightful.

I Sensory words are descriptive—they describe how we experience the
world: how we see, hear, smell, taste or feel something.
		 Complete the following table with sensory words from the text in Column
2 for the five senses in Column 1. Add new words in Column 3.
Column 1

Column 2

What you see

II Read the following sentences from the text and underline the verbs.
• I should divide the period into three parts.
• On the first day, I should want to see…
• The next day I should arise with the dawn…
• I should behold with awe…
		The words you have underlined are a combination of two verbs. In
each of these sentences, ‘should’ is the modal verb (suggestion), and the
second verb (divide, want, arise, behold) is the main verb.
Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express necessity, possibility,
permission, or ability. They are used before the main verb to give
additional information about the function of the main verb. Common
modal verbs include can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would,
must, and ought to.
III Identify the modal verbs in the following sentences. Choose the functions
they express from those given in the box below.
possibility

necessity

polite request

Follow the guidelines given below to draft this paragraph.
1. In the opening line, begin with something interesting to capture the
reader’s attention. Introduce the place you visited.
2. In the supporting lines, describe the place using adjectives and specific
details that appealed to your five senses—sight, sound, smell, taste, and
touch. You may include alliterations, similes, and personifications to
hold the reader’s attention.
3. In the concluding lines, summarise the description to provide a final
impression. Mention what was the most important thing about that

touch with the help of Braille, a
code of raised dots that represents
the letters of the alphabet. This

Braille, who became blind at a very
young age due to an accident.

TRANSCRIPTS
The Day the River Spoke
Let us listen (refer to page 12)
I Read the words given in the box below. You will listen to five people
speak about school life. As you listen, circle the words that are used by
the speakers. There are two words you do not need.

Speaker (i):		(Father) Should girls attend school? Yes, they
should. I do my best to ensure that both my son and
daughter get equal opportunities. I look forward
to their successful careers and rewarding lives. I
feel education gives freedom to make choices in
life. Whether my daughter wants to work in an
organisation or be a homemaker, it should be her
choice and the same applies to my son.
Speaker (ii): (Grandmother) I went to school but many girls at
that time could not attend school because some
elders in the village felt that girls should help in
the house and take care of their little brothers and
sisters. I am happy that the situation has changed
today.
Speaker (iii): (Teacher) The school prepares students for
meaningful and useful participation in the world
of work by learning hands-on abilities and skills,
developing equal respect for head-hands-heart,
valuing the dignity of labour, and understanding
vocational choices for the future.
Speaker (iv): (Student) I like to go to school. I feel that by coming
to school and reading the books, I learn about things
from all over the world. I also have friends with
whom I can share my feelings.

Speaker (v) : (Principal) Everyone should attend school. You
must’ve noticed that the girls are doing very well.
However, as the Head of an institution, I know that
all students can work hard. My message to students
is that they should attend school regularly and take
part in every school activity without bothering
whether it is for girls or boys. The idea is to focus on
learning.
II You will once again listen to the five speakers. As you listen, match each
statement 1–7 to each speaker (i)–(v). There are two statements that you
do not need.

Try Again
Let us listen (refer to page 24)
1. You will listen to a story about an ant. Read the questions given below
and before you listen, guess the answers to these questions.
		 Hello everyone,
		 I’m sure you have enjoyed learning about King Bruce and the spider. Let
me share another story with you.

In a thick green forest, there lived a little ant. She was known for
her determination and never-give-up attitude. One sunny day,
the ant found a delicious piece of roti that was too big for her to
carry alone.
“This crumb is huge, but I must get it back to the anthill. My
family will be so happy!” she thought to herself.
She tried to lift the crumb with all her might, but it was too heavy.
She tried pushing it, pulling it and even rolling it, but nothing
seemed to work. Exhausted and saddened, she sat down and
began to cry.

40

Unit 1.indd 40

As the ant sat there, feeling beaten, she noticed a small bird
nearby. The bird was trying to build a nest. It picked up twigs
and leaves, but every time it tried to place them, the wind would
blow them away. However, the bird did not give up. It kept trying,
over and over again, until finally, it managed to build a strong
nest.

06-Mar-25 2:47:33 PM

Learning Together

“If that bird can keep trying and succeed, then I shouldn’t give
up either,” she thought, feeling inspired.
Determined once more, the ant gathered all her strength and
decided to try again. She called her fellow ants for help. Together,
they formed a chain and lifted the crumb with their combined
strength. Slowly but surely, they carried the crumb back to the
anthill.
“We did it! Thank you, everyone! We showed that with teamwork
and never giving up, we can achieve anything!” the ant shouted,
excited and grateful.
She and her friends celebrated their success.
We too should learn this lesson from the ant’s experience—never
give up, no matter how difficult the situation may seem.
Hope you all liked the story.
Thank you!
2. Now, listen to the story once again and as you listen, check whether your
answers are correct. Rectify wherever needed.

		 You will listen to a conversation between a mother and son. As you listen,
select four true statements from 1–7 given below.

Anuj

: Ma, we have a new student in our class, Tara. She’s
quite talkative and pleasant. You know, the writing in
her books doesn’t look like ours. It’s different. She told
us that it’s called Braille.

Mother : It’s great to know that your school has facilities to
address the needs of the visually impaired. Thanks to
the Digital India Initiative, which is paving the way for
inclusion of the visually impaired.
41

Anuj

: Oh, Digital India! That’s about being computer literate,
isn’t it?

Mother : Well, Digital India is about more than just internet
access. It aims to include everyone, including people
with disabilities, by providing digital infrastructure
and services. For the visually impaired, it means access
to assistive technologies like screen readers, voice-overenabled smartphones and apps that can make daily
activities easier.
Anuj

: Ohh... interesting. What is a screen reader, Ma?

Mother : I knew you’d ask about it! Well, a screen reader is a
software application that helps people who are visually
impaired use computers and smartphones. It reads out
the text displayed on the screen and provides audio
feedback.
Anuj

: That’s amazing! So, Tara can use a computer just like
we do?

Mother : Yes, she can.
Anuj

: So, it makes a big difference in their daily lives.

Mother : It certainly does. It ensures that people who are visually
impaired can use digital services independently, without
help from others. This can improve their quality of life.
It also opens up more job opportunities in fields like IT,
banking, and more, where they can work just efficiently
like anybody else.
Anuj

: Wow! So that means people who are visually impaired
can work and do things on their own? I’m so proud of
my school.

Mother : Yes, and this way, we can ensure that the benefits of
Digital India reach everyone, helping them to participate
fully in all areas of life.
		 Remember, inclusion is not just about having the right tools, but also
about having the right mindset.

Let us read

I
Doctor Dolittle was sitting in his kitchen talking with the Cat’sfood-Man who had come to see him with a stomach-ache.
“Why don’t you give up being a people’s doctor, and be an
animal doctor?” asked the Cat’s-food-Man.
The parrot, Polynesia, was sitting in the window looking out
at the rain and singing a sailor song to herself. She stopped
singing and started to listen.

scholar: a
learned person

“You see, Doctor,” the Cat’s-food-Man went on, “you know all
about animals—much more than what these vets here do.
That book you wrote—about cats, why, it’s wonderful! I can’t
read or write myself—my wife, Theodosia, is a scholar, and
she read your book to me. You might have been a cat yourself.
You know the way they think.”
When the Cat’s-food-Man had gone the parrot flew off the
window on to the Doctor’s table and said, “That man’s got
sense. That’s what you ought to do. Be an animal doctor. Give
the silly people up—if they haven’t brains enough to see you’re
the best doctor in the world. Take care of animals instead—
they’ll soon find it out. Be an animal doctor.”
“Oh, there are plenty of animal doctors,” said John Dolittle,
putting the flowerpots outside on the windowsill to get the
rain.
“Yes, there are plenty,” said Polynesia. “But none of them are

any good at all. Now listen, Doctor, and I’ll tell you something.
Did you know that animals can talk?”
“I knew that parrots can talk,” said the Doctor.
“Oh, we parrots can talk in two languages—people’s language
and bird language,” said Polynesia proudly. “If I say, ‘Polly
wants a cracker’, you understand me. But hear this: Ka-ka oiee, fee-fee?”

cracker: a thin,
dry biscuit
usually eaten
with cheese

“Good Gracious!” cried the Doctor. “What does that mean?”
“That means, ‘Is the porridge hot yet?’—in bird language.”
“My! You don’t say so!” said the Doctor. “You never talked that
way to me before.”
“What would have been the good?” said Polynesia, dusting
some cracker crumbs off her left wing. “You wouldn’t have
understood me if I had.”
“Tell me some more,” said the Doctor, all excited; and he
rushed over to the drawer and came back with a book and
a pencil. “Now don’t go too fast—and I’ll write it down.
This is interesting—very interesting—something quite new.
Give me the Birds’ A.B.C. first—slowly now.”

Birds’ A.B.C.:
(here) the
language that
birds speak

So that was the way the Doctor came to know that animals
had a language of their own and could talk to one
another. And all that afternoon, while it was
raining, Polynesia sat on the kitchen table
giving him bird words to put down in the
book.
At teatime, when the dog, Jip, came in,
the parrot said to the Doctor, “See, he’s
talking to you.”
“Looks to me as though he were
scratching his ear,” said the Doctor.
“But animals don’t always speak
with their mouths,” said the parrot
in a high voice, raising her eyebrows.
“They talk with their ears, with their
feet, with their tails—with everything.
Sometimes they don’t want to make a

noise. Do you see now the way he’s twitching up one side of his
nose?”
“What’s that mean?” asked the Doctor.
“That means, ‘Can’t you see that it has stopped raining?’”
Polynesia answered. “He is asking you a question. Dogs nearly
always use their noses for asking questions.”
After a while, with the parrot’s help, the Doctor got to learn the
language of the animals so well that he could talk to them himself
and understand everything they said. Then he gave up being a
people’s doctor altogether.
Let us discuss
I Complete the following sentence by selecting a suitable reason.
		The Cat’s-food-Man suggests to Doctor Dolittle that he should
become an animal doctor because he believes that Dolittle

2. enjoys the company of animals as they speak less
3. dislikes spending time with human patients
4. knows more about animals than the local veterinarians
II Fill in the blanks by choosing the suitable option given in the brackets.
		 Doctor Dolittle reacts to Polynesia’s information about animal languages
with both excitement and ____________ (certainty/curiosity). He rushes
to ____________ (write/memorise) the bird words she provides and is

III Do you think Doctor Dolittle would be famous as an animal doctor?
If yes, why? If not, why not?

II
As soon as the Cat’s-food-Man had told everyone that John Dolittle
was going to become an animal doctor, old ladies began to bring
him their pet pugs and poodles who had eaten too much cake;
and farmers came many miles to show him sick cows and sheep.

One day a plough horse was brought to him; and the poor thing
was terribly glad to find a man who could talk in horse language.
“You know, Doctor,” said the horse, “that vet over the hill knows
nothing at all. He has been treating me six weeks now—for
something or the other. What I need is spectacles. I am going
blind in one eye. There’s no reason why horses shouldn’t wear
glasses, the same as people. But that stupid man over the hill
never even looked at my eyes. He kept on giving me big pills.
I tried to tell him, but he couldn’t understand a word of horse
language. What I need is spectacles.”
“Of course—of course,” said the Doctor. “I’ll get you some at once.”
“I would like a pair like yours,” said the horse—“only green.
They’ll keep the Sun out of my eyes while I’m ploughing the field.”
“Certainly,” said the Doctor. “Green ones you shall have.”
“You know, the trouble is, Sir,” said the plough horse as the
Doctor opened the front door to let him out—“the trouble is that
anybody thinks he can doctor animals—just because the animals
don’t complain. As a matter of fact, it takes a much cleverer man
to be a really good animal doctor than it does to be a good people’s
doctor.”
“Well, well!” said the Doctor.
“When will my glasses be ready?”

“I’ll have them for you next week,” said the Doctor.
“Come in again Tuesday—Good morning!”

Then John Dolittle got a fine, big pair of green spectacles; and
the plough horse stopped going blind in one eye and could see
as well as ever.
countryside:
rural area

And soon it became a common sight to see farm animals
wearing glasses in the countryside, round Puddleby; and a
blind horse was a thing unknown.
And so it was with all the other animals that were brought to
him. As soon as they found that he could talk their language,
they told him where the pain was and how they felt, and of
course it was easy for him to cure them.
Now all these animals went back and told their brothers and
friends that there was a doctor in the little house with the big
garden who really was a doctor. And whenever any creatures
got sick—not only horses and cows and dogs—but all the little
things of the fields, like harvest mice, badgers, and bats, all
came at once to his house on the edge of the town, so that his
big garden was nearly always crowded with animals trying to
get in to see him.
There were so many that came that he had to have special
doors made for the different kinds. He wrote ‘HORSES’ over

48

the front door, ‘COWS’ over the side door, and ‘SHEEP’ on the
kitchen door. Each kind of animal had a separate door—even
the mice had a tiny tunnel made for them into the cellar, where
they waited patiently in rows for the Doctor to come round
to them.
And so, in a few years’ time, every living thing for miles and
miles got to know about John Dolittle, M.D. And the birds who
flew to other countries in the winter told the animals in foreign
lands about Dolittle who could understand their talk and help
them in their troubles. In this way he became famous among
the animals—all over the world. He was happy and liked his
life very much.

3. How does Doctor Dolittle’s readiness to follow the parrot’s advice
highlight the importance of listening to different viewpoints?
4. Which qualities of Doctor Dolittle made him famous among the
animals? Explain with evidence from the text.
5. What changes do you think would happen in the world if people
suddenly gained the ability like Doctor Dolittle, to understand and
communicate with animals?

Let us learn
I Read the following words from the text.
		
Cat’s-food-Man, bird language, flowerpots
		 Are all the words that are combined to form another word written the
same way?
Compound words are formed by combining two words of different
parts of speech to create a new word that has an entirely new meaning.
They are of three types─hyphenated (Cat’s-food-Man), open compound
words (bird language) and closed compound words (flowerpots).

VI Read the following sentences
from the text.
• That man’s (man has) got
sense.
• Can’t you see that it has
stopped raining?
		 In the first sentence the verbs,
‘has got’ denote an action that is
relevant at the time of speaking.
		 In the second sentence, the verbs
‘has stopped’ denote an action
that is recently completed.

We use present perfect tense to
indicate:
• a recently completed action
• an action that started in the
past and is relevant even at the
moment of speaking
• an action in the past where the
focus is on the action and not
on the time of occurrence (but
relevant at the time of speaking)

Let us read
One day a funny kind of man
Came walking down this street
He wore a shoe upon his head
And hats upon his feet.
He raised the shoe and smiled at me,
His manners were polite;
But never had I seen before
Such a funny sounding sight.
He said, “Allow me to present
Your Highness with a rose.”
And taking out a currant bun
He held it to my nose.
I staggered back against the wall
And then I answered, “Well!
I never saw a rose with such
A funny looking smell.”
He then began to sing a song,
And sat down on the ground;
You never heard in all your life
Such a funny feeling sound.
“My friend, why do you wear two hats
Upon your feet?” I said.
He turned the other way about,
And hopped home on his head.

Let us learn
Read the following phrases from the poem.
• walking down

• taking out

• sat down

These are phrasal verbs.
Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb with a preposition or
adverb that together function as a single unit. They often have
meanings that are different from the individual words used alone.
The same verb followed by different prepositions or adverbs conveys
different meanings.

		 The man quickly requests, “God, may I have a rupee?”
		 God promptly says, “Wait a minute.”
		 Work in pairs and take turns to tell the joke.
		Remember:
• Narrator’s voice – your own voice (speak in a matter-of-fact manner)

Let us explore
I In ancient Indian literature and mythology, there are several humorous
or funny characters who play important roles in the stories. These
characters often represent wit, humour and mischief while conveying
deeper moral lessons. Here are a few well-known funny characters:
			 Tenali Rama

Birbal

Mullah Nasruddin

			 King Vikramaditya and Betal
		 Take any story to read and share it with your classmates and the teacher.
II We can identify the acts of the funny man with certain modernday activities that have playfulness, or unconventional behaviour.
For example:
Street Performers or Clowns: Like the funny man in the poem, modernday street performers or clowns often dress in unusual ways and do
unexpected acts to entertain people.

67

Unit 2.indd 67

06-Mar-25 2:51:09 PM

Poorvi

Performance Art or Abstract Theatre: The funny man’s actions, such
as singing a song and hopping on his head, resemble performance art
or abstract theatre, where artists break conventional rules to create
thought-provoking, often humorous experiences.
		
Children’s Entertainment and Comedy Shows: The funny man’s behaviour
is reflected in children’s shows to evoke laughter.
		In these examples, the common theme is humour, imagination, and
defying logic or expectation, which is exactly what the funny man in the
poem represents.
III Sukumar Ray, an Indian poet and illustrator, wrote poems in a similar
style in his book Abol Tabol.

Mrs. Shaw : I can’t tell you everything, but
you’ll always be right if you’re

you. Laugh a lot, and try to make
them laugh too. And if everyone stops talking, say
something to make them talk again. They don’t want
to sit here and look at the floor without speaking.
Think of something to say.
Mary

: I can do that. There’s always something to say. Must I
do anything else?

Mrs. Shaw : When they are ready to leave, don’t jump out of your
chair and look gladly at the door. You must look sorry
when they want to leave.
Mary

: What shall I do when they want to go?

Mrs. Shaw : Ask them to stay a little while longer. Just say, “Must
you go? Can’t you stay?” or something like that. You
like them and you want them to stay, and you must
let them understand that.
Mary

: That’s not very hard, is it? I’ll remember that. “Must
you go? Can’t you stay? Must you go? Can’t you stay?”

Mrs. Shaw : That’s right. Now take your coat to your room
and change into a clean dress. You must look nice
when they come. And if everyone stops talking, say
something kind to make them talk again. And don’t
say anything that will make them angry.

Mrs. Harding : Yes, we like it very much. It’s not the same as
London, but there are some very nice people
here, and we’ve found a good house. (No one says
anything more, and Mrs. Shaw looks at Mary.)
Mary

: What beautiful children you have, Mrs. Harding!
I’ve often seen them walking along the road.

Mrs. Harding : Oh, I haven’t any children.
Mary

: Oh, yes, you have! I’ve seen them: a little boy and
a little girl.

Mrs. Harding : (not very pleased) I have no children; believe me.
Mary

: Oh!

Mrs. Shaw

: (quietly) They must be someone else’s children.
Have you met Mr. Best? He’s a nice man. He lives
near you.

Mary

: Oh, Mr. Best! He lives here and he works in
London. He goes all the way to London by train
every morning, and then he comes all the way
back by train every night. He lives in trains! (she
laughs) What kind of life is that? Why do people
do things like that? They do not know how to live.
And he reads two newspapers in the train every
day. He never reads a book. But he’s only a banker,
and bankers can’t think.

Mrs. Lee

: My brother’s a banker. He goes to London by train
every morning and comes back every night. He
reads two newspapers in the train in the morning,
and another every night.

Mary

: Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know.

Mrs. Shaw

: Bankers always have to read a lot of newspapers.
Do you know Mrs. Best? She’s a nice woman. I like
her.

: But have you seen her clothes? She goes out in a
blue dress with a red coat over it. (she laughs)

the doctor to go to see her. I can’t understand
women who stay in bed in the morning. And why
must she always ask for the doctor? I’ve never

Pomeroy on his horse. He’s always talking about
horses. He rides a horse every day, and practises
shooting. Why must he do that? What have they
done to Mr. Pomeroy? Why do some men like
horses more than they like people? It’s hard to
understand men.

Mrs. Lee

: My brother practises shooting when he has the
time, and he rides his horse when he can. He sold
his house in London and bought a house here
because he wanted to ride and practise shooting.

Mrs. Harding : (looking at Mrs. Lee) It’s getting a little late. We

a conversation between a mother and her son about basic manners. As
you listen, fill in the blanks given below by selecting the correct option.
(Transcript for the teacher on pg. 89 )
1. How did the son behave in the grocery queue?
(i)

strangely

(ii) impatiently

(iii) politely

2. The mother finally refers to her son as a __________________.
(i)

polite young man

(ii) responsible son

(iii) grateful person

II You will once again listen to the conversation. As you listen, select four
true statements from 1– 7 given below.
1. The mother uses the grocery store incident as an opportunity to teach
her son about patience and fairness.
2. The son recognises the value of apologising and understands that
it shows he notices others.
3. The son is gradually learning the importance of polite words and
actions from his mother’s guidance.
4. The mother discourages her son from speaking softly in public,
suggesting that people should adjust to his voice level.
5. The son feels that covering his mouth when coughing is only
important when he’s at home.
6. The son receives all advice readily while understanding its
importance.
7. The mother uses praise to support the polite behaviours she wants
her son to continue practising.

Let us speak
		 As you know
• Intonation is the rise and fall of the pitch of tone while speaking.
		 Let us learn about sentence stress.
• Sentence stress is laying emphasis on certain word(s) in a sentence.

→ The emphasis on particular words helps to convey the meaning
and importance of the sentence.

84

Unit 2.indd 84

06-Mar-25 2:51:35 PM

Wit and Humour

→ Content words like book, run, beautiful, quickly, etc., are mostly
stressed instead of function words like she, in, is, etc., in a sentence.
I Speak the given declarative sentence aloud.
I saw Mrs. Cotter this afternoon.
• Use falling intonation towards end of the sentence as declarative
sentences usually have falling intonation.
• Stress the words ‘Mrs. Cotter’.
		 Remember, stress does not mean to say the word louder than others. It
means to say a word with more emphasis than others.
II Speak the following declarative sentences with falling intonation and
stress the highlighted words.
1. The room looks cleaner now.

2. You always talk too much.

3. You leave your clothes all over the house.
III Work in pairs and speak the following sentences 1–5 aloud, as Mary.
Apply stress and falling intonation. Match each of the sentences to the
meaning they convey in (i)–(v).
		Sentences
1. I didn’t hurt anyone today.

2. I didn’t hurt anyone today.

3. I didn’t hurt anyone today.

4. I didn’t hurt anyone today.

5. I didn’t hurt anyone today.
		 Meaning conveyed
(i)

I might have done other things but did not hurt anyone.

(ii) I might cause hurt usually, but not anyone on this day.
(iii) The action of hurting anyone did not occur.
(iv) I, specifically, did not hurt anyone, possibly implying someone
else might have.
(v) I may have spoken a lot many things but not a single person
was hurt.

IV Now, speak the given declarative sentence with rising intonation towards
the end of sentence and stress the highlighted words.
		 I saw Mrs. Cotter this afternoon.
		 The rising intonation makes it sound like a question. It asks whether I
was the person who actually saw Mrs. Cotter: Did I see Mrs. Cotter this
afternoon?
Remember
The way we use stress and intonation in a sentence can change the
meaning of what we wish to say if we are not careful.

Let us write
Rewrite the play ‘Say the Right Thing’ as a short story, focusing on Mary’s
interactions with her mother and the guests.
• Ensure the story captures the main events, character emotions, and
humorous moments effectively.
• Use paragraphs to organise your story and include descriptive language
to bring the characters and events to life.
You may refer to the following hints:
• Begin with an introduction: describe Mary and Mrs. Shaw, their
relationship and the setting of the story.
• Explain Mrs. Shaw’s instructions to Mary before the guests arrive and
Mary’s confidence in handling the situation.
• Narrate the events when Mrs. Harding and Mrs. Lee visit, highlighting
Mary’s remarks and the guests’ reactions.
• Include key moments of humour and awkwardness to maintain the tone
of the play.
• Conclude by commenting on how the visit ended and Mary’s impact on
the situation.

		 Let us explore
I Work in groups. Enact your favourite part of the play.
		 Points to remember:

86

• Allot a specific role to each member in the group.
For example: director, narrator, and characters

• Include the actions and expressions as indicated

II Find out how people greet guests who visit their
homes in different languages. Share it with your
classmates and the teacher.
III ‘Vasudhaiva Kuṭumbakaṁ’ (olq/So dq VqEcde) is a
Sanskrit phrase which means the world is one family. Vasudha (olq/k)
means Earth; eva (,o) translates to ‘is thus’ and Kuṭumbakaṁ (dq VqEcde)
means ‘family’. The phrase originates from ancient Indian texts like
the Maha Upanishad and the Hitopadesha.
		This saying highlights the interconnectedness of all people,
suggesting that humanity is part of a single global family. It
encourages unity, cooperation, and treating others with kindness
and empathy, regardless of differences in nationality, race, or
religion. The message is often used to promote global peace and
mutual understanding among diverse cultures and nations.
‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ was chosen as the theme for the G20
Summit which captured the essence of global unity, common bonds,
and shared aspirations for a better future.

lunch. I served myself dal-chawal and ate it, still thinking about
all the topics I needed to cover.
Once I finished my lunch, I got up to put my shoes away in my
room and placed my plate in the kitchen. However, being so
preoccupied, I ended up doing the opposite! I walked to my room
with my plate in hand and left it on my desk. Then, I took my
shoes and placed them in the kitchen!
As I stood there, confused, I realised what I had done. I couldn’t
help but laugh at myself. I shook my head, recovered my shoes
from the kitchen and kept the plate in the kitchen.

for everyone, right?
Son

: Hmm, I guess. Even if it takes a lot of time?

Mother : Well, that’s when we practise patience. And when it’s
our turn, what do we say to the shopkeeper?

: We say, ‘Thank you’. And ‘Please’ if we ask for something,
right?

important?

Mother : Exactly! It shows gratitude and kindness. And what
about yesterday when you bumped into that lady with
the blue sari?
Son

: Oh, I said sorry right away. You always tell me it’s
important to apologise.

Mother : That’s true. Why do you think it’s important to
apologise?
Son

: Um… so people know I didn’t mean to do it and that I
care?

Mother : Yes, it shows you’re responsible. And how about when
we’re in places like the library? What kind of voice
should we use?
Son

: Oh, I know this! We speak softly so we don’t bother
others.

Mother : Right again! It’s called using an ‘inside voice’.
Son

: I know. I also know that we should cover our mouth
when we yawn, sneeze or cough in a gathering or a
public place.

Mother : Absolutely! You’re getting really good at remembering
these things. And when we talk at home or school, what
should we do when someone else is speaking?
Son

: We wait for our turn. It’s not well-mannered to
interrupt.

Mother : You’ve got it, Rohan. You’re becoming a really polite
young man.
Son

: Thanks, Ma. So, do you think I’ll be ready to handle the
grocery queue next time?

Mother : Certainly! And maybe we can get some ice cream as a
reward if you do it well.
Son

: Deal! And… thank you!
