UNIT 1
DIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLD

Chapter 1 Biology is the science of life forms and living processes. The living world
The Living World comprises an amazing diversity of living organisms. Early man could

easily perceive the difference between inanimate matter and living
Chapter 2 organisms. Early man deified some of the inanimate matter (wind, sea,
Biological Classification fire etc.) and some among the animals and plants. A common feature of

all such forms of inanimate and animate objects was the sense of awe
Chapter 3 or fear that they evoked. The description of living organisms including
Plant Kingdom human beings began much later in human history. Societies which

indulged in anthropocentric view of biology could register limited
Chapter 4 progress in biological knowledge. Systematic and monumental
Animal Kingdom description of life forms brought in, out of necessity, detailed systems

of identification, nomenclature and classification. The biggest spin off
of such studies was the recognition of the sharing of similarities among
living organisms both horizontally and vertically. That all present day
living organisms are related to each other and also to all organisms
that ever lived on this earth, was a revelation which humbled man and
led to cultural movements for conservation of biodiversity. In the
following chapters of this unit, you will get a description, including
classification, of animals and plants from a taxonomist’s perspective.

Born on 5 July 1904, in Kempten, Germany, ERNST MAYR, the
Harvard University evolutionary biologist who has been called
‘The Darwin of the 20th century’, was one of the 100 greatest
scientists of all time. Mayr joined Harvard’s Faculty of Arts
and Sciences in 1953 and retired in 1975, assuming the title
Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology Emeritus. Throughout
his nearly 80-year career, his research spanned ornithology,
taxonomy, zoogeography, evolution, systematics, and the
history and philosophy of biology. He almost single-handedly
made the origin of species diversity the central question of
evolutionary biology that it is today. He also pioneered the
currently accepted definition of a biological species. Mayr was
awarded the three prizes widely regarded as the triple crown of
biology: the Balzan Prize in 1983, the International Prize for
Biology in 1994, and the Crafoord Prize in 1999. Mayr died at
the age of 100 in the year 2004.

the migrating birds, the valley of flowers or the attacking shark evokes
awe and a deep sense of wonder. The ecological conflict and cooperation
among members of a population and among populations of a community
or even the molecular traffic inside a cell make us deeply reflect on – what
indeed is life? This question has two implicit questions within it. The first
is a technical one and seeks answer to what living is as opposed to the
non-living, and the second is a philosophical one, and seeks answer to
what the purpose of life is. As scientists, we shall not attempt answering
the second question. We will try to reflect on – what is living?

1.1 DIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLD

If you look around you will see a large variety of living organisms, be it
potted plants, insects, birds, your pets or other animals and plants. There
are also several organisms that you cannot see with your naked eye but
they are all around you. If you were to increase the area that you make
observations in, the range and variety of organisms that you see would
increase. Obviously, if you were to visit a dense forest, you would probably
see a much greater number and kinds of living organisms in it. Each
different kind of plant, animal or organism that you see, represents a
species. The number of species that are known and described range
between 1.7-1.8 million. This refers to biodiversity or the number and

Reprint 2025-26



4 BIOLOGY

types of organisms present on earth. We should remember here that as
we explore new areas, and even old ones, new organisms are continuously
being identified.

As stated earlier, there are millions of plants and animals in the world;
we know the plants and animals in our own area by their local names.
These local names would vary from place to place, even within a country.
Probably you would recognise the confusion that would be created if we
did not find ways and means to talk to each other, to refer to organisms
we are talking about.

Hence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms
such that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the
world. This process is called nomenclature. Obviously, nomenclature
or naming is only possible when the organism is described correctly and
we know to what organism the name is attached to. This is identification.

In order to facilitate the study, number of scientists have established
procedures to assign a scientific name to each known organism.  This is
acceptable to biologists all over the world. For plants, scientific names are
based on agreed principles and criteria, which are provided in International
Code for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). You may ask, how  are animals
named? Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of Zoological
Nomenclature (ICZN). The scientific names ensure that each organism
has only one name. Description of any organism should enable the people
(in any part of the world) to arrive at the same name. They also ensure
that such a name has not been used for any other known organism.

Biologists follow universally accepted principles to provide scientific
names to known organisms.  Each name has two components – the
Generic name and the specific epithet. This system of providing a
name with two components is called Binomial nomenclature. This
naming system given by Carolus Linnaeus is being practised by biologists
all over the world. This naming system using a two word format was
found convenient. Let us take the example of mango to understand the
way of providing scientific names better. The scientific name of mango is
written as Mangifera indica. Let us see how it is a binomial name.  In this
name Mangifera represents the genus while indica, is a particular species,
or a specific epithet. Other universal rules of nomenclature are as follows:

1. Biological names are generally in Latin and written in italics.
They are Latinised or derived from Latin irrespective of their
origin.

2. The first word in a biological name represents the genus while
the second component denotes the specific epithet.

3. Both the words in a biological name, when handwritten, are
separately underlined, or printed in italics to indicate their Latin
origin.

Reprint 2025-26



THE LIVING WORLD 5

4. The first word denoting the genus starts with a capital letter
while the specific epithet starts with a small letter. It can be
illustrated with the example of Mangifera indica.

Name of the author appears after the specific epithet, i.e., at the end of
the biological name and is written in an abbreviated form, e.g., Mangifera
indica Linn. It indicates that this species was first described by Linnaeus.

Since it is nearly impossible to study all the living organisms, it is
necessary to devise some means to make this possible. This process is
classification. Classification is the process by which anything is grouped
into convenient categories based on some easily observable characters.
For example, we easily recognise groups such as plants or animals or
dogs, cats or insects. The moment we use any of these terms, we associate
certain characters with the organism in that group. What image do you
see when you think of a dog ? Obviously, each one of us will see ‘dogs’
and not ‘cats’. Now, if we were to think of ‘Alsatians’ we know what we are
talking about. Similarly, suppose we were to say ‘mammals’, you would,
of course, think of animals with external ears and body hair. Likewise, in
plants, if we try to talk of ‘Wheat’, the picture in each of our minds will be
of wheat plants, not of rice or any other plant. Hence, all these - ‘Dogs’,
‘Cats’, ‘Mammals’, ‘Wheat’, ‘Rice’, ‘Plants’, ‘Animals’, etc., are convenient
categories we use to study organisms. The scientific term for these
categories is taxa. Here you must recognise that taxa can indicate
categories at very different levels. ‘Plants’ – also form a taxa. ‘Wheat’ is
also a taxa. Similarly, ‘animals’, ‘mammals’, ‘dogs’ are all taxa – but you
know that a dog is a mammal and mammals are animals. Therefore,
‘animals’, ‘mammals’ and ‘dogs’ represent taxa at different levels.

Hence, based on characteristics, all living organisms can be classified
into different taxa. This process of classification is taxonomy. External
and internal structure, along with the structure of cell, development
process and ecological information of organisms are essential and form
the basis of modern taxonomic studies.

Hence, characterisation, identification, classification and nomenclature
are the processes that are basic to taxonomy.

Taxonomy is not something new. Human beings have always been
interested in knowing more and more about the various kinds of
organisms, particularly with reference to their own use. In early days,
human beings needed to find sources for their basic needs of food, clothing
and shelter. Hence, the earliest classifications were based on the ‘uses’ of
various organisms.

Human beings were, since long, not only interested in knowing more
about different kinds of organisms and their diversities, but also the
relationships among them. This branch of study was referred to as
systematics. The word systematics is derived from the Latin word
‘systema’ which means systematic arrangement of organisms.  Linnaeus

6 BIOLOGY

used Systema Naturae as the  title of his publication.  The scope of
systematics was later enlarged to include identification, nomenclature
and classification. Systematics takes into account evolutionary
relationships between organisms.

1.2 TAXONOMIC CATEGORIES

Classification is not a single step process but involves hierarchy of steps
in which each step represents a rank or category.  Since the category is a
part of overall taxonomic arrangement, it is called the taxonomic category
and all categories together constitute the taxonomic hierarchy.  Each
category, referred to as a unit of classification, in fact, represents a rank
and is commonly termed as taxon (pl.: taxa).

Taxonomic categories and hierarchy can be illustrated by an example.
Insects represent a group of organisms sharing common features like
three pairs of jointed legs.  It means insects are recognisable concrete
objects which can be classified, and thus were given a rank or category.
Can you name other such groups of organisms? Remember, groups
represent category.  Category further denotes rank.  Each rank or taxon,
in fact, represents a unit of classification. These taxonomic groups/
categories are distinct biological entities and not merely morphological
aggregates.

Taxonomical studies of all known organisms have led to the
development of common categories such as kingdom, phylum or division
(for plants), class, order, family, genus and species. All organisms,
including those in the plant and animal kingdoms have species as the
lowest category. Now the question you may ask is, how to place an
organism in various categories? The basic requirement is the knowledge
of characters of an individual or group of organisms.  This helps in
identifying similarities and dissimilarities among the individuals of the
same kind of organisms as well as of other kinds of organisms.

1.2.1 Species

Taxonomic studies consider a group of individual organisms with
fundamental similarities as a species.  One should be able to distinguish
one species from the other closely related species based on the distinct
morphological differences. Let us consider Mangifera indica, Solanum
tuberosum (potato) and Panthera leo (lion). All the three names, indica,
tuberosum and leo, represent the specific epithets,  while the first words
Mangifera, Solanum and Panthera are genera and represents another
higher level of taxon or category. Each genus may have one or more than
one specific epithets representing different organisms, but having
morphological similarities.  For example,  Panthera has another specific
epithet called tigris and Solanum includes species like nigrum and

Reprint 2025-26



THE LIVING WORLD 7

melongena. Human beings belong to the species sapiens  which is grouped
in the genus Homo. The scientific name thus, for human being, is written
as Homo sapiens.

1.2.2 Genus
Genus comprises a group of related species which has more characters
in common in comparison to species of other genera. We can say that
genera are aggregates of closely related species. For example, potato and
brinjal are two different species but both belong to the genus Solanum.
Lion (Panthera leo), leopard (P. pardus) and tiger (P. tigris) with several
common features, are all species of the genus Panthera. This genus differs
from another genus Felis which includes cats.

1.2.3 Family
The next category, Family, has a group of related genera with still less
number of similarities as compared to genus and species.   Families are
characterised on the basis of both vegetative and reproductive features of
plant species. Among plants for example, three different genera Solanum,
Petunia and Datura are placed in the family Solanaceae. Among animals
for example, genus Panthera, comprising lion, tiger, leopard is put along
with genus, Felis (cats) in the family Felidae. Similarly, if you observe the
features of a cat and a dog, you will find some similarities and  some
differences as well. They are separated into two different families – Felidae
and Canidae, respectively.

1.2.4 Order
You have seen earlier that categories like species, genus and families are
based on a number of similar characters.   Generally, order and other
higher taxonomic categories are identified based on the aggregates of
characters.  Order being a higher category, is the assemblage of families
which exhibit a few similar characters.  The similar characters are less in
number as compared to different genera included in a family.  Plant
families like Convolvulaceae, Solanaceae are included in the order
Polymoniales mainly based on the floral characters. The animal order,
Carnivora, includes families like Felidae and Canidae.

1.2.5 Class
This category includes related orders. For example, order Primata
comprising monkey, gorilla and gibbon is placed in class Mammalia along
with order Carnivora that includes animals like tiger, cat and dog. Class
Mammalia has other orders also.

1.2.6 Phylum

Classes comprising animals like fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds along
with mammals constitute the next higher category called Phylum. All

these, based on the common features like presence of notochord
and dorsal hollow neural system, are included in phylum
Chordata.  In case of plants,  classes with a few similar characters
are assigned to a higher category called Division.

1.2.7 Kingdom

All animals belonging to various phyla are assigned to the
highest category called Kingdom Animalia in the classification
system of animals. The Kingdom Plantae, on the other hand, is
distinct, and comprises all plants from various divisions.
Henceforth, we will refer to these two groups as animal and
plant kingdoms.

The taxonomic categories from species to kingdom have been
shown in ascending order starting with species in Figure 1.1.
These are broad categories.  However, taxonomists have also
developed sub-categories in this hierarchy to facilitate more
sound and scientific placement of various taxa.

Look at the hierarchy in Figure 1.1. Can you recall the basis
of arrangement? Say, for example, as we go higher from species
to kingdom, the number of common characteristics goes on
decreasing. Lower the taxa, more are the characteristics that the

THE LIVING WORLD 9

SUMMARY

The living world is rich in variety. Millions of plants and animals have been
identified and described but a large number still remains unknown. The
very range of organisms in terms of size, colour, habitat, physiological and
morphological features make us seek the defining characteristics of living
organisms. In order to facilitate the study of kinds and diversity of organisms,
biologists have evolved certain rules and principles for identification,
nomenclature and classification of organisms. The branch of knowledge
dealing with these aspects is referred to as taxonomy. The taxonomic studies
of various species of plants and animals are useful in agriculture, forestry,
industry and in general for knowing our bio-resources and their diversity.
The basics of taxonomy like identification, naming and classification of
organisms are universally evolved under international codes. Based on the
resemblances and distinct differences, each organism is identified and
assigned a correct scientific/biological name comprising two words as per
the binomial system of nomenclature. An organism represents/occupies a
place or position in the system of classification. There are many categories/
ranks which are generally referred to as taxonomic categories or taxa. All
the categories constitute a taxonomic hierarchy.

CHAPTER  2
BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION

2.1 Kingdom Monera Since the dawn of civilisation, there have been many attempts to classify
living organisms. It was done instinctively not using criteria that were

to classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals

2.5 Kingdom into two groups, those which had red blood and those that did not.
Animalia In Linnaeus' time a Two Kingdom system of classification with

2.6 Viruses, Viroids Plantae  and Animalia kingdoms was developed that included all

and Lichens plants and animals respectively. This system did not distinguish between
the eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms
and photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi)
organisms. Classification of organisms into plants and animals was easily
done and was easy to understand, but, a large number of organisms
did not fall into either category. Hence the two kingdom classification
used for a long time was found inadequate.  Besides, gross morphology
a need was also felt for including other characteristics like cell structure,
nature of wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction,
evolutionary relationships, etc.  Classification systems for the living
organisms have hence, undergone several changes over the time.
Though plant and animal kingdoms have been a constant under all
different systems, the understanding of what groups/organisms be
included under these kingdoms have been changing; the number and
nature of other kingdoms have also been understood differently by
different scientists over the time.

R.H. Whittaker (1969) proposed a Five Kingdom Classification. The
kingdoms defined by him were named Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae
and Animalia. The main criteria for classification used by him include cell
structure, body organisation, mode of nutrition, reproduction and
phylogenetic relationships. Table 2.1 gives a comparative account of different
characteristics of the five kingdoms.

The three-domain system has also been proposed that divides the Kingdom
Monera into two domains, leaving the remaining eukaryotic kingdoms in the
third domain and thereby a six kingdom classification. You will learn about
this system in detail in higher classes.

Let us look at this five kingdom classification to understand the issues
and considerations that influenced the classification system. Earlier
classification systems included bacteria, blue green algae, fungi, mosses,
ferns, gymnosperms and the angiosperms under ‘Plants’. The character
that unified this whole kingdom was that all the organisms included had a
cell wall in their cells.  This placed together groups which widely differed in
other characteristics. It brought together the prokaryotic bacteria and the
blue green algae ( cyanobacteria) with other groups which were eukaryotic.
It also grouped together the unicellular organisms and the multicellular
ones, say, for example, Chlamydomonas and Spirogyra were placed together
under algae. The classification did not differentiate between the heterotrophic
group – fungi, and the autotrophic green plants, though they also showed
a characteristic difference in their walls composition – the fungi had chitin

Reprint 2025-26



12 BIOLOGY

in their walls while the green plants had a cellulosic cell wall.  When such
characteristics were considered, the fungi were placed in a separate
kingdom – Kingdom Fungi. All prokaryotic organisms were grouped
together under Kingdom Monera and the unicellular eukaryotic organisms
were placed in Kingdom Protista. Kingdom Protista has brought together
Chlamydomonas, Chlorella (earlier placed in Algae within Plants and both
having cell walls) with Paramoecium and Amoeba (which were earlier placed
in the animal kingdom which lack cell wall). It has put together organisms
which, in earlier classifications, were placed in different kingdoms.  This
happened because the criteria for classification changed. This kind of
changes will take place in future too depending on the improvement in our
understanding of characteristics and evolutionary relationships. Over time,
an attempt has been made to evolve a classification system which reflects
not only the morphological, physiological and reproductive similarities,
but is also phylogenetic, i.e., is based on  evolutionary relationships.

In this chapter we will study characteristics of Kingdoms Monera,
Protista and Fungi of the Whittaker system of classification.  The Kingdoms
Plantae and Animalia, commonly referred to as plant and animal
kingdoms, respectively, will be dealt separately in chapters 3 and 4.

2.1 KINGDOM MONERA

Bacteria are the sole members of the Kingdom Monera. They are the most
abundant micro-organisms. Bacteria occur almost everywhere. Hundreds
of bacteria are present in a handful of soil. They also live in extreme habitats
such as hot springs, deserts, snow and deep oceans where very few other
life forms can survive. Many of them live in or on other organisms as
parasites.

Bacteria are grouped under four categories based on their shape: the
spherical Coccus (pl.: cocci), the rod-shaped Bacillus (pl.: bacilli), the
comma-shaped Vibrium (pl.: vibrio) and the spiral Spirillum (pl.: spirilla)
(Figure 2.1).

Reprint 2025-26



BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 13

Though the bacterial structure is very simple, they are very complex
in behaviour. Compared to many other organisms, bacteria as a group
show the most extensive metabolic diversity. Some of the bacteria are
autotrophic, i.e., they synthesise their own food from inorganic substrates.
They may be photosynthetic autotrophic or chemosynthetic autotrophic.
The vast majority of bacteria are heterotrophs, i.e., they depend on other
organisms or on dead organic matter for food.

2.1.1 Archaebacteria

These bacteria are special since they live in some of the most harsh habitats
such as extreme salty areas (halophiles), hot springs (thermoacidophiles)
and marshy areas (methanogens). Archaebacteria differ from other bacteria
in having a different cell wall structure and this feature is responsible for
their survival in extreme conditions. Methanogens are present in the gut
of several ruminant animals such as cows and buffaloes and they are
responsible for the production of methane (biogas) from the dung of these
animals.

2.1.2 Eubacteria

There are thousands of different eubacteria or ‘true
bacteria’. They are characterised by the presence of a
rigid cell wall, and if motile, a flagellum. The
cyanobacteria (also referred to as blue-green algae)
have chlorophyll a similar to green plants and are
photosynthetic autotrophs (Figure 2.2). The
cyanobacteria are unicellular, colonial or filamentous,
freshwater/marine or terrestrial algae. The colonies
are generally surrounded by gelatinous sheath. They
often form blooms in polluted water bodies. Some of
these organisms can fix atmospheric nitrogen in
specialised cells called heterocysts, e.g., Nostoc and
Anabaena. Chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria
oxidise various inorganic substances such as
nitrates, nitrites and ammonia and use the released
energy for their ATP production. They play a great role
in recycling nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous,
iron and sulphur.

Heterotrophic bacteria are most abundant in
nature. The majority are important decomposers.
Many of them have a significant impact on human

roots, etc. Some are pathogens causing damage
to human beings, crops, farm animals and pets.
Cholera, typhoid, tetanus, citrus canker are well
known diseases  caused by different bacteria.

Bacteria reproduce mainly by fission (Figure
2.3). Sometimes, under unfavourable conditions,
they produce spores. They also reproduce by a
sort of sexual reproduction by adopting a
primitive type of DNA transfer from one bacterium
to the other.

Figure 2.3 A dividing bacterium The Mycoplasma are organisms that
completely lack a cell wall. They are the smallest

living cells known and can survive without oxygen. Many mycoplasma
are pathogenic in animals and plants.

2.2 KINGDOM PROTISTA

All single-celled eukaryotes are placed under Protista, but the boundaries
of this kingdom are not well defined. What may be ‘a photosynthetic
protistan’ to one biologist may be ‘a plant’ to another. In this book we
include Chrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime moulds and
Protozoans under Protista. Members of Protista are primarily aquatic.
This kingdom forms a link with the others dealing with plants, animals
and fungi. Being eukaryotes, the protistan cell body contains a well defined
nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Some have flagella or
cilia. Protists reproduce asexually and sexually by a process involving
cell fusion and zygote formation.

2.2.1 Chrysophytes

This group includes diatoms and golden algae (desmids). They are found
in fresh water as well as in marine environments. They are microscopic
and float passively in water currents (plankton). Most of them are
photosynthetic. In diatoms the cell walls form two thin overlapping shells,
which fit together as in a soap box. The walls are embedded with silica
and thus the walls are indestructible. Thus, diatoms have left behind
large amount of cell wall deposits in their habitat; this accumulation over
billions of years is referred to as ‘diatomaceous earth’. Being gritty this
soil is used in polishing, filtration of oils and syrups. Diatoms are the
chief ‘producers’ in the oceans.

BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 15

2.2.2 Dinoflagellates

These organisms are mostly marine and photosynthetic.
They appear yellow, green, brown, blue or red depending
on the main pigments present in their cells. The cell wall
has stiff cellulose plates on the outer surface. Most of
them have two flagella; one lies longitudinally and the
other transversely in a furrow between the wall plates.
Very often, red dinoflagellates (Example: Gonyaulax)
undergo such rapid multiplication that they make the
sea appear red (red tides). Toxins released by such large
numbers may even kill other marine animals such as
fishes. (a)

2.2.3 Euglenoids

Majority of them are fresh water organisms found in
stagnant water. Instead of a cell wall, they have a protein
rich layer called pellicle which makes their body flexible.
They have two flagella, a short and a long one. Though (b)
they are photosynthetic in the presence of sunlight, when
deprived of sunlight they behave like heterotrophs by
predating on other smaller organisms. Interestingly, the
pigments of euglenoids are identical to those present in
higher plants. Example: Euglena (Figure 2.4b).

2.2.4 Slime Moulds

Slime moulds are saprophytic protists. The body moves
along decaying twigs and leaves engulfing organic
material. Under suitable conditions, they form an
aggregation called plasmodium which may grow and (c)
spread over several feet. During unfavourable conditions,
the plasmodium differentiates and forms fruiting bodies
bearing spores at their tips. The spores possess true walls.
They are extremely resistant and survive for many years,
even under adverse conditions. The spores are dispersed
by air currents.

2.2.5 Protozoans

All protozoans are heterotrophs and live as predators or (d)
parasites. They are believed to be primitive relatives of
animals. There are four major groups of protozoans. Figure 2.4 (a) Dinoflagellates

their prey by putting out pseudopodia (false feet) as in Amoeba. Marine
forms have silica shells on their surface. Some of them such as Entamoeba
are parasites.

Flagellated protozoans: The members of this group are either free-living
or parasitic. They have flagella. The parasitic forms cause diaseases such
as sleeping sickness. Example: Trypanosoma.

Ciliated protozoans: These are aquatic, actively moving organisms because
of the presence of thousands of cilia. They have a cavity (gullet) that opens
to the outside of the cell surface. The coordinated movement of rows of
cilia causes the water laden with food to be steered into the gullet. Example:
Paramoecium (Figure 2.4d).

Sporozoans: This includes diverse organisms that have an infectious
spore-like stage in their life cycle. The most notorious is Plasmodium
(malarial parasite) which causes malaria, a disease which has a staggering
effect on human population.

2.3 KINGDOM FUNGI

The fungi constitute a unique kingdom of heterotrophic organisms. They
show a great diversity in morphology and habitat. You  must have seen
fungi on a moist bread and rotten fruits. The common mushroom you eat
and toadstools are also fungi. White spots seen on mustard leaves are due
to a parasitic fungus. Some unicellular fungi, e.g., yeast are used to make
bread and beer. Other fungi cause diseases in plants and animals; wheat
rust-causing Puccinia is an important example. Some are the source of
antibiotics, e.g., Penicillium. Fungi are cosmopolitan and occur in air, water,
soil and on animals and plants.  They prefer to grow in warm and humid
places. Have you ever wondered why we keep food in the refrigerator ? Yes,
it is to prevent food from going bad due to bacterial or fungal infections.

With the exception of yeasts which are unicellular, fungi are
filamentous. Their bodies consist of long, slender thread-like structures
called hyphae. The network of hyphae is known as mycelium. Some hyphae
are continuous tubes filled with multinucleated cytoplasm – these are
called coenocytic hyphae. Others have septae or cross walls in their
hyphae. The cell walls of fungi are composed of chitin and polysaccharides.

Most fungi are heterotrophic and absorb soluble organic matter from
dead substrates and hence are  called saprophytes. Those that depend
on living plants and animals are called parasites. They can also live as
symbionts – in association with algae as lichens and with roots of higher
plants as mycorrhiza.

Reproduction in fungi can take place by vegetative means –
fragmentation, fission and budding. Asexual reproduction is by spores

called conidia or sporangiospores or zoospores, and sexual reproduction
is by oospores, ascospores and basidiospores. The various spores are
produced in distinct structures called fruiting bodies. The sexual cycle
involves the following  three steps:

(i) Fusion of protoplasms between two motile or non-motile gametes
called plasmogamy.

(ii) Fusion of two nuclei called karyogamy.

(iii) Meiosis in zygote resulting in haploid spores.

When a fungus reproduces sexually, two haploid
hyphae of compatible mating types come together and
fuse. In some fungi the fusion of two haploid cells
immediately results in diploid cells (2n). However, in other
fungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes), an intervening
dikaryotic stage (n + n, i.e., two nuclei per cell) occurs;
such a condition is called a dikaryon and the phase is
called dikaryophase of fungus. Later, the parental nuclei
fuse and the cells become diploid.  The fungi form fruiting
bodies in which reduction division occurs, leading to (a)

formation of haploid spores.
The morphology of the mycelium, mode of spore

formation and fruiting bodies  form the basis for the
division of the kingdom  into various classes.

2.3.1 Phycomycetes

Members of phycomycetes are found in aquatic habitats
and on decaying wood in moist and damp places or as

(b)
obligate parasites on plants. The mycelium is aseptate
and coenocytic. Asexual reproduction takes place by
zoospores (motile) or by aplanospores (non-motile). These
spores are endogenously produced in sporangium. A
zygospore is formed by fusion of two gametes. These
gametes are similar in morphology (isogamous) or
dissimilar (anisogamous or oogamous). Some common
examples are Mucor (Figure 2.5a), Rhizopus (the bread
mould mentioned earlier) and Albugo (the parasitic fungi
on mustard).

2.3.2 Ascomycetes

Commonly known as sac-fungi, the ascomycetes  are mostly (c)
multicellular, e.g., Penicillium, or rarely unicellular, e.g., yeast
(Saccharomyces). They are saprophytic, decomposers, Figure 2.5 Fungi: (a) Mucor

is branched and septate. The asexual spores are conidia produced
exogenously on the special mycelium called conidiophores. Conidia on
germination produce mycelium. Sexual spores are called ascospores
which are produced endogenously in sac like asci (singular ascus). These
asci are arranged in different types of fruiting bodies called ascocarps.
Some examples are Aspergillus (Figure 2.5b), Claviceps and Neurospora.
Neurospora  is used extensively in biochemical and genetic work. Many
members like morels and truffles are edible and are considered  delicacies.

2.3.3 Basidiomycetes

Commonly known forms of basidiomycetes are mushrooms, bracket
fungi or puffballs. They grow in soil, on logs and tree stumps and in
living plant bodies as parasites, e.g., rusts and smuts. The mycelium is
branched and septate. The asexual spores are generally not found, but
vegetative reproduction by fragmentation is common. The sex organs
are absent, but plasmogamy is brought about by fusion of two vegetative
or somatic cells of different strains or genotypes. The resultant structure
is dikaryotic which ultimately gives rise to basidium. Karyogamy and
meiosis take place in the basidium producing four basidiospores. The
basidiospores are exogenously produced on the basidium (pl.: basidia).
The basidia are arranged in fruiting bodies called basidiocarps. Some
common members are Agaricus (mushroom) (Figure 2.5c), Ustilago (smut)
and Puccinia (rust fungus).

2.3.4 Deuteromycetes

Commonly known as imperfect fungi because only the asexual or
vegetative phases of these fungi are known.  When the sexual forms of
these fungi were discovered they were moved into classes they rightly
belong to.  It is also possible that the asexual and vegetative stage have
been given one name (and placed under deuteromycetes) and the sexual
stage another (and placed under another class).  Later when the linkages
were established, the fungi were correctly identified and moved out of
deuteromycetes. Once perfect (sexual) stages of members of
dueteromycetes were discovered, they were often moved to ascomycetes
and basidiomycetes. The deuteromycetes reproduce only by asexual spores
known as conidia. The mycelium is septate and branched. Some members
are saprophytes or parasites while a large number of them are
decomposers of litter and help in mineral cycling. Some examples are
Alternaria, Colletotrichum and Trichoderma.

2.4 KINGDOM PLANTAE

Kingdom Plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing
organisms commonly called plants. A few members are partially
heterotrophic such as the insectivorous plants or parasites. Bladderwort
and Venus fly trap are examples of insectivorous plants and Cuscuta is a
parasite. The plant cells have an eukaryotic structure with prominent
chloroplasts and cell wall mainly made of cellulose. You will study the
eukaryotic cell structure in detail in Chapter 8. Plantae includes algae,
bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms.

Life cycle of plants has two distinct phases – the diploid sporophytic
and the haploid gametophytic – that alternate with each other. The lengths
of the haploid and diploid phases, and whether these phases are free–
living or dependent on others, vary among different groups in plants.
This phenomenon is called alternation of generations. You will study
further details of this kingdom in Chapter 3.

2.5 KINGDOM ANIMALIA

This kingdom is characterised by heterotrophic eukaryotic organisms
that are multicellular and their cells lack cell walls. They directly or
indirectly depend on plants for food. They digest their food in an internal
cavity and store food reserves as glycogen or fat. Their mode of nutrition
is holozoic – by ingestion of food. They follow a definite growth pattern
and grow into adults that have a definite shape and size. Higher forms
show elaborate sensory and neuromotor mechanism. Most of them are
capable of locomotion.

The sexual reproduction is by copulation of male and female followed
by embryological development. Salient features of various phyla are
described in Chapter 4.

2.6 VIRUSES, VIROIDS, PRIONS AND LICHENS

In the five kingdom classification of Whittaker there is no mention of lichens
and some acellular organisms like viruses, viroids and prions. These are
briefly introduced here.

All of us who have suffered the ill effects of common cold or ‘flu’ know
what effects viruses can have on us, even if we do not associate it with our
condition. Viruses did not find a place in classification since they are not
considered truly ‘living’, if we understand living as those organisms that
have a cell structure.  The viruses are non-cellular organisms that are
characterised by having an inert crystalline structure outside the living cell.

Once they infect a cell, they take over the machinery of the host cell to
replicate themselves, killing the host. Would you call viruses living or non-
living?

Virus means venom or poisonous fluid. Dmitri Ivanowsky (1892)
recognised certain microbes as causal organism of the mosaic disease of
tobacco (Figure 2.6a). These were found to be smaller than bacteria
because they passed through bacteria-proof filters. M.W. Beijerinck
(1898) demonstrated that the extract of the infected plants of  tobacco
could cause infection in healthy plants and named the new pathogen
“virus” and called the fluid as Contagium vivum fluidum (infectious living
fluid).  W.M. Stanley (1935) showed that viruses could be crystallised
and crystals consist largely of proteins. They are inert outside their specific
host cell. Viruses are obligate parasites.

In addition to proteins, viruses also contain genetic material, that could
be either RNA or DNA.  No virus contains both RNA and DNA.  A virus is
a nucleoprotein and the genetic material is infectious. In general, viruses
that infect plants have single stranded RNA and viruses that infect animals
have either single or double stranded RNA or double stranded DNA.
Bacterial viruses or bacteriophages (viruses that infect the bacteria) are
usually double stranded DNA viruses (Figure 2.6b). The protein coat
called capsid made of small subunits called capsomeres, protects the
nucleic acid. These capsomeres are arranged in helical or polyhedral
geometric forms. Viruses cause diseases like  mumps, small pox, herpes
and influenza. AIDS in humans is also caused by a virus. In plants, the
symptoms can be mosaic formation, leaf rolling and curling, yellowing

and vein clearing, dwarfing  and stunted growth.
Viroids : In 1971, T.O. Diener discovered a new infectious agent that
was smaller than viruses and caused potato spindle tuber disease. It was
found to be a free RNA; it lacked the protein coat that is found in viruses,
hence the name viroid. The RNA of the viroid was of low molecular weight.
Prions : In modern medicine certain infectious neurological diseases
were found to be transmitted by an agent consisting of abnormally folded
protein. The agent was similar in size to viruses. These agents were called
prions. The most notable diseases caused by prions are bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) commonly called   mad cow disease in cattle and
its analogous variant Creutzfeldt–Jacob disease (CJD) in humans.
Lichens : Lichens are symbiotic associations i.e. mutually useful
associations, between algae and fungi. The algal component is known as
phycobiont and fungal component as mycobiont, which are autotrophic
and heterotrophic, respectively. Algae prepare food for fungi and fungi
provide shelter and absorb mineral nutrients and water for its partner.
So close is their association that if one saw a lichen in nature one would
never imagine that they had two different organisms within them.  Lichens

are very good pollution indicators – they do not grow in polluted areas.

SUMMARY

Biological classification of plants and animals was first proposed by Aristotle on
the basis of simple morphological characters. Linnaeus later classified all living
organisms into two kingdoms – Plantae and Animalia. Whittaker proposed an
elaborate five kingdom classification – Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and
Animalia. The main criteria of the five kingdom classification were cell structure,
body organisation, mode of nutrition and reproduction, and phylogenetic
relationships.

In the five kingdom classification, bacteria are included in Kingdom Monera.
Bacteria are cosmopolitan in distribution. These organisms show the most extensive
metabolic diversity. Bacteria may be autotrophic or heterotrophic in their mode of
nutrition. Kingdom Protista includes all single-celled eukaryotes such as
Chrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime-moulds and Protozoans. Protists
have defined nucleus and other membrane bound organelles. They reproduce
both asexually and sexually. Members of Kingdom Fungi show a great diversity
in structures and habitat. Most fungi are saprophytic in their mode of nutrition.
They show asexual and sexual reproduction. Phycomycetes, Ascomycetes,
Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes are the four classes under this kingdom.
The plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing organisms. Algae,
bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms are included in this
group. The life cycle of plants exhibit alternation of generations – gametophytic
and sporophytic generations. The heterotrophic eukaryotic, multicellular
organisms lacking a cell wall are included in the Kingdom Animalia. The mode of

organisms under the system proposed by Whittaker (1969) wherein he

suggested the Five Kingdom classification viz. Monera, Protista, Fungi,

3.3 Pteridophytes Animalia and Plantae.  In this chapter, we will deal in detail with further
classification within Kingdom Plantae popularly known as the ‘plant

kingdom’.

3.5 Angiosperms We must stress here that our understanding of the plant kingdom
has changed over time. Fungi, and members of the Monera and Protista
having cell walls have now been excluded from Plantae though earlier
classifications placed them in the same kingdom.  So, the cyanobacteria
that are also referred to as blue green algae are not ‘algae’ any more.  In
this chapter, we will describe Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes,
Gymnosperms and Angiosperms under Plantae.

Let us also look at classification within angiosperms to understand
some of the concerns  that influenced the classification systems. The
earliest systems of classification used only gross superficial morphological
characters such as habit, colour, number and shape of leaves, etc.  They
were based mainly on vegetative characters or on the androecium
structure (system given by Linnaeus). Such systems were artificial; they
separated the closely related species since they were based on a few
characteristics. Also, the artificial systems gave equal weightage to
vegetative and sexual characteristics; this is not acceptable since we know
that often the vegetative characters are more easily affected by
environment. As against this, natural classification systems developed,
which were based on natural affinities among the organisms and consider,

not only the external features, but also internal features, like ultra-
structure, anatomy, embryology and phytochemistry. Such a
classification for flowering plants was given by George Bentham and
Joseph Dalton Hooker.

At present phylogenetic classification systems based on
evolutionary relationships between the various organisms are acceptable.
This assumes that organisms belonging to the same taxa have a common
ancestor.   We now use information from many other sources too to help
resolve difficulties in classification.  These become more important when
there is no supporting fossil evidence. Numerical Taxonomy which is
now easily carried out using computers is based on all observable
characteristics. Number and codes are assigned to all the characters and
the data are then processed. In this way each character is given equal
importance and at the same time hundreds of characters can be
considered. Cytotaxonomy, that is based on cytological information
like chromosome number, structure, behaviour and chemotaxonomy,
that uses the chemical constituents of the plant to resolve confusions,
are also used by taxonomists these days.

3.1 ALGAE

Algae are chlorophyll-bearing, simple, thalloid, autotrophic and
largely aquatic (both fresh water and marine) organisms. They occur
in a variety of other habitats: moist stones, soils and wood. Some of
them also occur in association with fungi (lichen) and animals (e.g.,
on sloth bear).

The form and size of algae is highly variable, ranging from colonial
forms like Volvox and the filamentous forms like Ulothrix and Spirogyra
(Figure 3.1). A few of the marine forms such as kelps, form massive plant
bodies.

The algae reproduce by vegetative, asexual and sexual methods.
Vegetative reproduction is by fragmentation. Each fragment develops into
a thallus. Asexual reproduction is by the production of different types of
spores, the most common being the zoospores. They are flagellated
(motile) and on germination gives rise to new plants. Sexual reproduction
takes place through fusion of two gametes. These gametes can be
flagellated and similar in size (as in Ulothrix) or non-flagellated (non-motile)
but similar in size (as in Spirogyra). Such reproduction is called
isogamous. Fusion of two gametes dissimilar in size, as in species of
Eudorina is termed as anisogamous. Fusion between one large, non-
motile (static) female gamete and a smaller, motile male gamete is termed
oogamous, e.g., Volvox, Fucus.

26 BIOLOGY

Algae are useful to man in a variety of ways. At least a half of the
total carbon dioxide fixation on earth is carried out by algae through
photosynthesis. Being photosynthetic, they increase the level of dissolved
oxygen in their immediate environment. They are of paramount
importance as primary producers of energy-rich compounds which form
the basis of the food cycles of all aquatic animals. Many species of Porphyra,
Laminaria and Sargassum  are among the 70 species of marine algae
used as food. Certain marine brown and red algae produce large amounts
of hydrocolloids (water holding substances), e.g., algin (brown algae) and
carrageen (red algae) which are used commercially. Agar, one of the
commercial products obtained from Gelidium and Gracilaria are used to
grow microbes and in preparations of ice-creams and jellies. Chlorella,
a unicellular alga rich in proteins, is used as food supplement even by
space travellers. The algae are divided into three main classes:
Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae.

3.1.1 Chlorophyceae

The members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. The
plant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous. They are usually
grass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The
pigments are localised in definite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be
discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in
different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies
called pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein
besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets.
Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose
and an outer layer of pectose.

Vegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation.
Asexual reproduction is by flagellated zoospores produced in
zoosporangia. The sexual reproduction shows considerable variation in
the type and formation of sex cells and it may be isogamous,
anisogamous or oogamous. Some commonly found green algae are:
Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and Chara (Figure 3.1a).

3.1.2 Phaeophyceae

The members of phaeophyceae or brown algae are found primarily in
marine habitats. They show great variation in size and form. They range
from simple branched, filamentous forms (Ectocarpus) to profusely
branched forms as represented by kelps, which may reach a height of
100 metres. They possess chlorophyll a, c, carotenoids and xanthophylls.
They vary in colour from olive green to various shades of brown depending
upon the amount of the xanthophyll pigment, fucoxanthin present in

them. Food is stored as complex carbohydrates, which may be in the
form of laminarin or mannitol. The vegetative cells have a cellulosic wall
usually covered on the outside by a gelatinous coating of algin. The
protoplast contains, in addition to plastids, a centrally located vacuole
and nucleus. The plant body is usually attached to the substratum by a
holdfast, and has a stalk, the stipe and leaf like photosynthetic organ –
the frond. Vegetative reproduction takes place by fragmentation. Asexual
reproduction in most brown algae is by biflagellate zoospores that are
pear-shaped and have two unequal laterally attached flagella.

Sexual reproduction may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous.
Union of gametes may take place in water or within the oogonium
(oogamous species). The gametes are pyriform (pear-shaped) and bear
two laterally attached flagella. The common forms are Ectocarpus, Dictyota,
Laminaria, Sargassum and Fucus (Figure 3.1b).

3.1.3 Rhodophyceae

The members of rhodophyceae are commonly called red algae because of
the predominance of the red pigment, r-phycoerythrin in their body. Majority
of the red algae are marine with greater concentrations found in the warmer
areas. They occur in both well-lighted regions close to the surface of water
and also at great depths in oceans where relatively little light penetrates.

The red thalli of most of the red algae are  multicellular. Some of them
have complex body organisation. The food is stored as floridean starch
which is very similar to amylopectin and glycogen in structure.

The red algae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation. They
reproduce asexually by non-motile spores and sexually by non-motile

PLANT KINGDOM 29

Bryophytes are also called amphibians of the plant kingdom because
these plants can live in soil but are dependent on water for sexual
reproduction. They usually occur in damp, humid and shaded localities.
They play an important role in plant succession on bare rocks/soil.

The plant body of bryophytes is more differentiated than that of algae.
It is thallus-like and prostrate or erect, and attached to the substratum
by unicellular or multicellular rhizoids. They lack true roots, stem or
leaves. They may possess root-like, leaf-like or stem-like structures. The
main plant body of the bryophyte is haploid. It produces gametes, hence
is called a gametophyte. The sex organs in bryophytes are multicellular.
The male sex organ is called antheridium. They produce biflagellate
antherozoids. The female sex organ called archegonium is flask-shaped
and produces a single egg. The antherozoids are released into water where
they come in contact with archegonium. An antherozoid fuses with the
egg to produce the zygote. Zygotes do not undergo reduction division
immediately. They produce a multicellular body called a sporophyte.
The sporophyte is not free-living but attached to the photosynthetic
gametophyte and derives nourishment from it. Some cells of the
sporophyte undergo reduction division (meiosis) to produce haploid
spores.  These spores germinate to produce gametophyte.

Bryophytes in general are of little economic importance but some
mosses provide food for herbaceous mammals, birds and other animals.
Species of Sphagnum, a moss, provide peat that have long been used as
fuel,  and as packing material for trans-shipment of living material because
of their capacity to hold water. Mosses along with lichens are the first
organisms to colonise rocks and hence, are of great ecological importance.
They decompose rocks making the substrate suitable for the growth of
higher plants. Since mosses form dense mats on the soil, they reduce the
impact of falling rain and prevent soil erosion. The bryophytes are divided
into liverworts and mosses.

3.2.1 Liverworts

The liverworts grow usually in moist, shady habitats such as banks of
streams, marshy ground, damp soil, bark of trees and deep in the woods.
The plant body of a liverwort is thalloid, e.g., Marchantia. The thallus is
dorsiventral and closely appressed to the substrate. The leafy members
have tiny leaf-like appendages in two rows on the stem-like structures.

Asexual reproduction in liverworts takes place by fragmentation of
thalli, or by the formation of specialised structures called gemmae
(sing. gemma). Gemmae are green, multicellular, asexual buds, which
develop in small receptacles  called gemma cups located on the thalli.
The gemmae become detached from the parent body and germinate to
form new individuals. During sexual reproduction, male and female sex

30 BIOLOGY

organs are produced either on the same or on different thalli. The
sporophyte is differentiated into a foot, seta and capsule. After meiosis,
spores are produced within the capsule. These spores germinate to form
free-living gametophytes.

3.2.2 Mosses

The predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which
consists of two stages. The first stage is the protonema stage, which
develops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and
frequently filamentous stage. The second stage is the leafy stage, which
develops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. They consist of
upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. They are attached
to the soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bears
the sex organs.

Vegetative reproduction in mosses is by fragmentation and budding
in the secondary protonema. In sexual reproduction, the sex organs
antheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots.
After fertilisation, the zygote develops into a sporophyte, consisting of a
foot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than
that in liverworts. The capsule contains spores. Spores are formed after
meiosis. The mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal.
Common examples of mosses are Funaria, Polytrichum and Sphagnum
(Figure 3.2).

3.3 PTERIDOPHYTES

The Pteridophytes include horsetails and ferns. Pteridophytes are used
for medicinal purposes and as soil-binders. They are also frequently grown
as ornamentals. Evolutionarily, they are the first terrestrial plants to
possess vascular tissues – xylem and phloem. You shall study more about
these tissues in Chapter 6. The pteridophytes are found in cool, damp,
shady places though some may flourish well in sandy-soil conditions.

You may recall that in bryophytes the dominant phase in the life
cycle is the gametophytic plant body. However, in pteridophytes, the
main plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root,
stem and leaves (Figure 3.3). These organs possess well-differentiated
vascular tissues. The leaves in pteridophyta are small (microphylls) as
in Selaginella or large (macrophylls) as in ferns. The sporophytes bear
sporangia that are subtended by leaf-like appendages called
sporophylls. In some cases sporophylls may form distinct compact
structures called strobili or cones (Selaginella, Equisetum). The
sporangia produce spores by meiosis in spore mother cells. The spores
germinate to give rise to inconspicuous, small but multicellular,

32 BIOLOGY

free-living, mostly photosynthetic thalloid gametophytes called
prothallus. These gametophytes require cool, damp, shady places to
grow. Because of this specific restricted requirement and the need for
water for fertilisation, the spread of living pteridophytes is limited and
restricted to narrow geographical regions. The gametophytes bear male
and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia, respectively.
Water is required for transfer of antherozoids – the male gametes released
from the antheridia, to the mouth of archegonium. Fusion of male gamete
with the egg present in the archegonium result in the formation of zygote.
Zygote thereafter produces a multicellular well-differentiated sporophyte
which is the dominant phase of the pteridophytes. In majority of the
pteridophytes all the spores are of similar kinds; such plants are called
homosporous. Genera like Selaginella and Salvinia which produce
two kinds of spores, macro (large) and micro (small) spores, are known
as heterosporous. The megaspores and microspores germinate and give
rise to female and male gametophytes, respectively. The female
gametophytes in these plants are retained on the parent sporophytes
for variable periods. The development of the zygotes into young embryos
take place within the female gametophytes. This event is a precursor to
the seed habit considered an important step in evolution.

The pteridophytes are further classified into four classes: Psilopsida
(Psilotum); Lycopsida (Selaginella, Lycopodium), Sphenopsida (Equisetum)
and Pteropsida (Dryopteris, Pteris, Adiantum).

3.4 GYMNOSPERMS

The gymnosperms (gymnos : naked, sperma : seeds) are plants in which
the ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall and remain exposed, both
before and after fertilisation. The seeds that develop post-fertilisation, are
not covered, i.e., are naked. Gymnosperms include medium-sized trees
or tall trees and shrubs (Figure 3.4). One of the gymnosperms, the giant
redwood tree Sequoia is one of the tallest tree species. The roots are
generally tap roots. Roots in some genera have fungal association in the
form of mycorrhiza (Pinus), while in some others (Cycas) small specialised
roots called coralloid roots are associated with N - fixing cyanobacteria.

The stems are unbranched (Cycas) or branched (Pinus, Cedrus). The leaves
may be simple or compound. In Cycas the pinnate leaves persist for a few
years. The leaves in gymnosperms are well-adapted to withstand extremes
of temperature, humidity and wind. In conifers, the needle-like leaves
reduce the surface area. Their thick cuticle and sunken stomata also
help to reduce water loss.

The gymnosperms are heterosporous; they produce
haploid microspores and megaspores. The two kinds of
spores are produced within sporangia that are borne
on sporophylls which are arranged spirally along an axis
to form lax or compact strobili or cones. The strobili
bearing microsporophylls and microsporangia are
called microsporangiate or male strobili. The
microspores develop into a male gametophytic
generation which is highly reduced and is confined to
only a limited number of cells. This reduced
gametophyte is called a pollen grain. The development
of pollen grains take place within the microsporangia. (a)

The cones bearing megasporophylls with ovules or
megasporangia are called macrosporangiate or female
strobili. The male or female cones or strobili may be
borne on the same tree (Pinus). However, in cycas male
cones and megasporophylls are borne on different trees.
The megaspore mother cell is differentiated from one of
the cells of the nucellus. The nucellus is protected by
envelopes and the composite structure is called an
ovule. The ovules are borne on megasporophylls which
may be clustered to form the female cones. The
megaspore mother cell divides meiotically to form four
megaspores. One of the megaspores enclosed within the
megasporangium develops into a multicellular  female
gametophyte that bears two or more archegonia or
female sex organs. The multicellular female gametophyte
is also retained within megasporangium. (b)

Unlike bryophytes and pteridophytes, in
gymnosperms, the male and the female
gametophytes do not have an independent free-living Dwarf Shoot

existence. They remain within the sporangia retained
on the sporophytes. The pollen grain is released from
the microsporangium. They are carried in air

currents and come in contact with the opening of
the ovules borne on megasporophylls. The pollen

archegonia in the ovules and discharge their contents Seeds

fertilisation, zygote develops into an embryo and the (c)

3.5 ANGIOSPERMS

Unlike the gymnosperms where the ovules are naked, in the angiosperms
or flowering plants, the pollen grains and ovules are developed in
specialised structures called flowers. In angiosperms, the seeds are
enclosed in fruits. The angiosperms are an exceptionally large group of
plants occurring in wide range of habitats. They range in size from the
smallest Wolffia to tall trees of Eucalyptus (over 100 metres). They provide
us with food, fodder,  fuel, medicines and several other commercially
important products. They are divided into two classes : the dicotyledons
and the monocotyledons (Figure 3.5).

SUMMARY

Plant kingdom includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms
and angiosperms. Algae are chlorophyll-bearing simple, thalloid,
autotrophic and largely aquatic organisms. Depending on the type of
pigment possesed and the type of stored food, algae are classfied into
three classes, namely Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae.
Algae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation, asexually by
formation of different types of spores and sexually by formation of gametes
which may show isogamy, anisogamy or oogamy.

Bryophytes are plants which can live in soil but are dependent on
water for sexual reproduction. Their plant body is more differentiated
than that of algae. It is thallus-like and prostrate or erect and attached to
the substratum by rhizoids. They possess root-like, leaf-like and stem-

PLANT KINGDOM 35

like structures. The bryophytes are divided into liverworts and mosses.
The plant body of liverworts is thalloid and dorsiventral whereas mosses
have upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. The main
plant body of a bryophyte is gamete-producing and is called a
gametophyte. It bears the male sex organs called antheridia  and female
sex organs called archegonia. The male and female gametes produced
fuse to form zygote which produces a multicellular body called a
sporophyte. It produces haploid spores. The spores germinate to form
gametophytes.

In pteridophytes the main plant is a sporophyte which is differentiated
into true root, stem and leaves. These organs possess well-differentiated
vascular tissues. The sporophytes bear sporangia which produce spores.
The spores germinate to form  gametophytes which require cool, damp
places to grow. The gametophytes bear male and female sex organs called
antheridia and archegonia, respectively. Water is required for transfer of
male gametes to archegonium where zygote is formed after fertilisation.
The zygote produces a sporophyte.

The gymnosperms are the plants in which ovules are not enclosed by
any ovary wall. After fertilisation the seeds remain exposed and therefore
these plants are called naked-seeded plants. The gymnosperms produce
microspores and megaspores which are produced in microsporangia and
megasporangia borne on the sporophylls. The sporophylls –
microsporophylls and megasporophylls – are arranged spirally on axis
to form male and female cones, respectively. The pollen grain germinates
and pollen tube releases the male gamete into the ovule, where it fuses
with the egg cell in archegonia. Following fertilisation, the zygote develops
into embryo and the ovules into seeds.

The angiosperms are divided into two classes – the dicotyledons and
the monocotyledons.

CHAPTER  4
ANIMAL KINGDOM

4.1 Basis of When you look around, you will observe different animals with different

Classification structures and forms.  As over a million species of animals have been
described till now, the need for classification becomes all the more

4.2 Classification of
important. The classification also helps in assigning a systematic position

Animals to newly described species.

4.1 BASIS OF CLASSIFICATION

Inspite of differences in structure and form of different animals, there are
fundamental features common to various individuals in relation to the
arrangement of cells, body symmetry, nature of coelom, patterns of
digestive, circulatory or reproductive systems. These features are used
as the basis of animal classification and some of them are discussed here.

4.1.1 Levels of Organisation

Though all members of Animalia are multicellular, all of them do not
exhibit the same pattern of organisation of cells. For example, in sponges,
the cells are arranged as loose cell aggregates, i.e., they exhibit cellular
level of organisation. Some division of labour (activities) occur among
the cells. In coelenterates, the arrangement of cells is more complex. Here
the cells performing the same function are arranged into tissues, hence is
called tissue level of organisation. A still higher level of organisation, i.e.,
organ level is exhibited by members of Platyhelminthes and other higher
phyla where tissues are grouped together to form organs, each specialised
for a particular function. In animals like Annelids, Arthropods, Molluscs,

Reprint 2025-26



38 BIOLOGY

Echinoderms and Chordates, organs have
associated to form functional systems, each
system concerned with a specific physiological
function. This pattern is called organ system
level of organisation. Organ systems in different
groups of animals exhibit various patterns of
complexities. For example, the digestive system
in Platyhelminthes has only a single opening
to the outside of the body that serves as both
mouth and anus, and is hence called
incomplete. A complete digestive system has
two openings, mouth and anus. Similarly, the

Figure 4.1 (a)  Radial symmetry circulatory system may be of two types:

(i) open type in which the blood is pumped
out of the heart and the cells and tissues are
directly bathed in it and

(ii) closed type in which the blood is circulated
through a series of vessels of varying diameters
(arteries, veins and capillaries).

4.1.2 Symmetry

Animals can be categorised on the basis of their
symmetry. Sponges are mostly  asymmetrical,
i.e., any plane that passes through the centre
does not divide them into equal halves. When
any plane passing through the central axis of
the body divides the organism into two identical

Figure 4.1 (b) Bilateral symmetry halves, it is called radial symmetry.
Coelenterates, ctenophores and echinoderms
have this kind of body plan (Figure 4.1a).

Ectoderm
Mesoglea Animals like annelids, arthropods, etc., where

Endoderm the body can be divided into identical left and
right halves in only one plane, exhibit bilateral
symmetry (Figure 4.1b).

4.1.3 Diploblastic and Triploblastic
Organisation

Animals in which the cells are arranged in two
embryonic layers, an external ectoderm and

Mesoderm
(a) (b) an internal endoderm, are called diploblastic

animals, e.g., coelenterates. An undifferentiated
Figure 4.2 Showing germinal layers : layer, mesoglea, is present in between the

(a) Diploblastic (b) Triploblastic ectoderm and the endoderm (Figure 4.2a).

Reprint 2025-26



ANIMAL KINGDOM 3993

Those animals in which the developing embryo has a third germinal layer,
mesoderm, in between the ectoderm and endoderm, are called
triploblastic animals (platyhelminthes to chordates, Figure 4.2b).

4.1.4 Coelom

Presence or absence of a cavity between the body
wall and the gut wall is very important in
classification. The body cavity, which is lined
by mesoderm is called coelom. Animals
possessing coelom are called coelomates, e.g.,
annelids, molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms,
hemichordates and chordates (Figure 4.3a). In
some animals, the body cavity is not lined by
mesoderm, instead, the mesoderm is present as
scattered pouches in between the ectoderm and
endoderm. Such a body cavity is called
pseudocoelom and the animals possessing them
are called pseudocoelomates, e.g.,
aschelminthes (Figure 4.3b). The animals in
which the body cavity is absent are called Figure 4.3 Diagrammatic sectional view of :
acoelomates, e.g., platyhelminthes (Figure 4.3c). (a) Coelomate (b) Pseudocoelomate

(c) Acoelomate

4.1.5 Segmentation

In some animals, the body is externally and internally divided into
segments with a serial repetition of at least some organs. For example, in
earthworm, the body shows this pattern called metameric segmentation
and the phenomenon is known as metamerism.

4.1.6 Notochord

Notochord is a mesodermally derived rod-like structure formed on the
dorsal side during embryonic development in some animals. Animals with
notochord are called chordates and those animals which do not form this
structure are called non-chordates, e.g., porifera to echinoderms.

features as mentioned in the preceding sections, is given in Figure  4.4.

different phyla are described.

4.2.1 Phylum – Porifera

Members of this phylum are commonly known
as sponges. They are generally marine and mostly
asymmetrical animals (Figure 4.5). These are
primitive multicellular animals and have cellular
level of organisation. Sponges have a water
transport or canal system. Water enters through
minute pores (ostia) in the body wall into a central
cavity, spongocoel, from where it goes out
through the osculum. This pathway of water

(b) transport is helpful in food gathering, respiratory

(a) exchange and removal of waste. Choanocytes
or collar cells line the spongocoel and the canals.
Digestion is intracellular. The body is supported
by a skeleton made up of spicules or spongin
fibres. Sexes are not separate (hermaphrodite),
i.e., eggs and sperms are produced by the same
individual. Sponges reproduce asexually by
fragmentation and sexually by formation of

(c)
gametes. Fertilisation is internal and development

4.2.2 Phylum – Coelenterata (Cnidaria)

They are aquatic, mostly marine, sessile or free-swimming, radially
symmetrical animals (Figure 4.6). The name cnidaria is derived from the

cnidoblasts or cnidocytes (which contain the stinging capsules or
nematocysts) present on the tentacles and the body. Cnidoblasts are used
for anchorage, defense and for the capture of prey (Figure 4.7). Cnidarians
exhibit tissue level of organisation and are diploblastic. They have a central
gastro-vascular cavity with a single opening, mouth on hypostome.
Digestion is extracellular and intracellular. Some of the cnidarians, e.g.,
corals have a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate. Cnidarians exhibit
two basic body forms called polyp and medusa (Figure 4.6). The former
is a sessile and cylindrical form like Hydra, Adamsia, etc. whereas, the
latter is umbrella-shaped and free-swimming like Aurelia or jelly fish. Figure 4.7
Those cnidarians which exist in both forms exhibit alternation of Diagrammatic view of

generations (Metagenesis), i.e., polyps produce medusae asexually and Cnidoblast

medusae form the polyps sexually (e.g., Obelia).

4.2.3 Phylum – Ctenophora

Ctenophores, commonly known as sea walnuts or comb
jellies are exclusively marine, radially symmetrical, diploblastic
organisms with tissue level of organisation. The body bears
eight external rows of ciliated comb plates, which help in
locomotion (Figure 4.8). Digestion is both extracellular and
intracellular. Bioluminescence (the property of a living
organism to emit light) is well-marked in ctenophores. Sexes
are not separate. Reproduction takes place only by sexual
means. Fertilisation is external with indirect development.

Examples: Pleurobrachia and Ctenoplana.

4.2.4 Phylum – Platyhelminthes

They have dorso-ventrally flattened body, hence are called
flatworms (Figure 4.9). These are mostly endoparasites found
in animals including human beings. Flatworms are bilaterally
symmetrical, triploblastic and acoelomate animals with organ

Figure 4.8 Example of level of organisation. Hooks and suckers are present in the
Ctenophora parasitic forms. Some of them absorb nutrients from the host
(Pleurobrachia) directly through their body surface. Specialised cells called

flame cells help in osmoregulation and excretion. Sexes are not
separate. Fertilisation is internal and development is through
many larval stages. Some members like Planaria possess high
regeneration capacity.

4.2.5 Phylum – Aschelminthes

The body of the aschelminthes is circular in
cross-section, hence, the name roundworms
(Figure 4.10). They may be freeliving, aquatic
and terrestrial or parasitic in plants and animals.
Roundworms have organ-system level of body
organisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical,
triploblastic and pseudocoelomate animals.
Alimentary canal is complete with a well-
developed muscular pharynx. An excretory
tube removes body wastes from the body cavity
through the excretory pore. Sexes are separate
(dioecious), i.e., males and females are distinct.
Often females are longer than males. Fertilisation
is internal and development may be direct (the

4.2.6 Phylum – Annelida

They may be aquatic (marine and fresh water) or
terrestrial; free-living, and sometimes parasitic.
They exhibit organ-system level of body
organisation and bilateral symmetry. They are
triploblastic, metamerically segmented and
coelomate animals. Their body surface is
distinctly marked out into segments or
metameres and, hence, the phylum name
Annelida (Latin, annulus : little ring) (Figure 4.11).
They possess longitudinal and circular muscles
which help in locomotion. Aquatic annelids like
Nereis possess lateral appendages, parapodia,
which help in swimming. A closed circulatory
system is present. Nephridia (sing. nephridium)
help in osmoregulation and excretion. Neural
system consists of paired ganglia (sing. ganglion)
connected by lateral nerves to a double ventral
nerve cord. Nereis, an aquatic form, is dioecious,
but earthworms and leeches are monoecious.
Reproduction is sexual.

Hemichordata was earlier considered as a sub-phylum under
phylum Chordata. But now it is placed as a separate phylum Proboscis
under non-chordata. Hemichordates have a rudimentary
structure in the collar region called stomochord, a structure
similar to notochord.

Subphyla Urochordata and
Cephalochordata are often referred to as
protochordates (Figure 4.17) and are
exclusively marine. In Urochordata, notochord
is present only in larval tail, while in
Cephalochordata, it extends from head to tail
region and is persistent throughout their life.

Examples: Urochordata – Ascidia, Salpa,
Doliolum; Cephalochordata – Branchiostoma

The members of subphylum Vertebrata
possess notochord during the embryonic
period. The notochord is replaced by a
cartilaginous or bony vertebral column in the
adult. Thus all vertebrates are chordates but
all chordates are not vertebrates. Besides the

The class name refers to their creeping or crawling mode of locomotion
(Latin, repere or reptum, to creep or crawl). They are mostly terrestrial
animals and their body is covered by dry and cornified skin, epidermal
scales or scutes (Fig. 4.22). They do not have external ear openings.
Tympanum represents ear.  Limbs, when present, are two pairs. Heart is
usually three-chambered, but four-chambered in crocodiles. Reptiles are
poikilotherms. Snakes and lizards shed their scales as skin cast.  Sexes
are separate. Fertilisation is internal. They are oviparous and development
is direct.

4.2.11.6 Class – Aves

The characteristic features of Aves (birds) are the presence of feathers
and most of them can fly except flightless birds (e.g., Ostrich). They possess
beak (Figure 4.23). The forelimbs are modified into wings. The hind limbs
generally have scales and are modified for walking, swimming or clasping
the tree branches. Skin is dry without glands except the oil gland at the
base of the tail. Endoskeleton is fully ossified (bony) and the long bones
are hollow with air cavities (pneumatic). The digestive tract of birds has
additional chambers, the crop and gizzard. Heart is completely four-
chambered. They are warm-blooded (homoiothermous) animals, i.e.,
they are able to maintain a constant body temperature. Respiration is by

SUMMARY

The basic fundamental features such as level of organisation, symmetry,

cell organisation, coelom, segmentation, notochord, etc., have enabled us

to broadly classify the animal kingdom. Besides the fundamental features,

there are many other distinctive characters which are specific for each

phyla or class.

Porifera includes multicellular animals which exhibit cellular level of

organisation and have characteristic flagellated choanocytes. The

coelenterates have tentacles and bear cnidoblasts. They are mostly aquatic,

sessile or free-floating. The ctenophores are marine animals with comb

plates. The platyhelminths have flat body and exhibit bilateral symmetry.

The parasitic forms show distinct suckers and hooks. Aschelminthes are

pseudocoelomates and  include parasitic as well as non-parasitic

roundworms.

Annelids are metamerically segmented animals with a true coelom.

The arthropods are the most abundant group of animals characterised

by the presence of jointed appendages. The molluscs have a soft body

surrounded by an external calcareous shell. The body is covered with

external skeleton made of chitin. The echinoderms possess a spiny skin.

Their most distinctive feature is the presence of water vascular system.

The hemichordates are a small group of worm-like marine animals. They

have a cylindrical body with proboscis, collar and trunk.

Phylum Chordata includes animals which possess a notochord either

throughout or during early embryonic life. Other common features

observed in the chordates are the dorsal, hollow nerve cord and paired

pharyngeal gill slits. Some of the vertebrates do not possess jaws (Agnatha)

whereas most of them possess jaws (Gnathostomata). Agnatha is

represented by the class, Cyclostomata. They are the most primitive

chordates and are ectoparasites on fishes. Gnathostomata has two super

classes, Pisces and Tetrapoda. Classes Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes

bear fins for locomotion and are grouped under Pisces. The

Chondrichthyes are fishes with cartilaginous endoskeleton and are marine.

Classes, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves and Mammalia have two pairs of limbs

and are thus grouped under Tetrapoda. The amphibians have adapted

to live both on land and water. Reptiles are characterised by the presence

Reprint 2025-26



ANIMAL KINGDOM 5335

of dry and cornified skin. Limbs are absent in snakes. Fishes, amphibians

and reptiles are poikilothermous (cold-blooded). Aves are warm-blooded

animals with feathers on their bodies and forelimbs modified into wings

for flying. Hind limbs are adapted for walking, swimming, perching or

clasping. The unique features of mammals are the presence of mammary

glands and hairs on the skin. They commonly exhibit viviparity.

Chapter 5 The description of the diverse forms of life on earth was made only by

Flowering Plants and microscopes. This description is mainly of gross structural features,

both external and internal. In addition, observable and perceivable

Plants as a part of biology, naturalists described only biology. Hence, biology

remained as a natural history for a long time. The description, by itself,
Chapter 7 was amazing in terms of detail. While the initial reaction of a student
Structural Organisation in could be boredom, one should keep in mind  that the detailed description,
Animals was utilised in the later day reductionist biology where living processes

drew more attention from scientists than the description of life forms
and their structure. Hence, this description became meaningful and
helpful in framing research questions in physiology or evolutionary
biology. In the following chapters of this unit, the structural organisation
of plants and animals, including the structural basis of physiologial or
behavioural phenomena, is described. For convenience, this description
of morphological and anatomical features is presented separately for

KATHERINE ESAU was born in Ukraine in 1898. She  studied
agriculture in Russia and Germany and received her doctorate
in 1931 in United States. She reported in her early publications
that the curly top virus spreads through a plant via the food-
conducting or phloem tissue. Dr Esau’s Plant Anatomy published
in 1954 took a dynamic, developmental approach designed to
enhance one’s understanding of plant structure and an
enormous impact worldwide, literally bringing about a revival
of the discipline. The Anatomy of Seed Plants by Katherine Esau
was published in 1960. It was referred to as Webster’s of plant
biology – it is encyclopediac. In 1957 she was elected to the
National Academy of Sciences, becoming the sixth woman to
receive that honour. In addition to this prestigious award, she
received the National Medal of Science from President George
Bush in 1989.

When Katherine Esau died in the year 1997, Peter Raven,
director of Anatomy and Morphology, Missouri Botanical
Garden, remembered that she  ‘absolutely dominated’ the field

5.1.1 Regions of the Root

The root is covered at the apex by a thimble-like
structure called the root cap (Figure 5.3).  It
protects the tender apex of the root as it makes
its way through the soil. A few millimetres above
the root cap is the region of meristematic
activity.  The cells of this region are very small,
thin-walled and with dense protoplasm. They
divide repeatedly. The cells proximal to this
region undergo rapid elongation and
enlargement and are responsible for the growth
of the root in length. This region is called the
region of elongation. The cells of the elongation
zone gradually differentiate and mature. Hence,
this zone, proximal to region of elongation, is
called the region of maturation.  From this
region some of the epidermal cells form very fine Figure 5.3  The regions of the root-tip

and delicate, thread-like structures called root
hairs. These root hairs absorb water and
minerals from the soil.

5.2 THE STEM

What are the features that distinguish a stem from a root? The stem is the
ascending part of the axis bearing branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. It
develops from the plumule of the embryo of a germinating seed. The stem
bears nodes and internodes. The region of the stem where leaves are
born are called nodes while internodes are the portions between two nodes.
The stem bears buds, which may be terminal or axillary. Stem is generally
green when young and later often become woody and dark brown.

The main function of the stem is spreading out branches bearing
leaves, flowers and fruits. It conducts water, minerals and photosynthates.
Some stems perform the function of storage of food, support, protection
and of vegetative propagation.

5.3 THE LEAF

The leaf is a lateral, generally flattened structure borne on the stem. It
develops at the node and bears a bud in its axil. The axillary bud later
develops into a branch. Leaves originate from shoot apical meristems and
are arranged in an acropetal order. They are the most important vegetative
organs for photosynthesis.

Lamina A typical leaf consists of three main parts:  leaf
base, petiole and lamina (Figure 5.4 a). The leaf is

Stipule
attached to the stem by the leaf base and may bear
two lateral small leaf like structures called stipules.
In monocotyledons, the leaf base expands into a
sheath covering the stem partially or wholly. In some

Petiole leguminous plants the leafbase may become
Axillary swollen, which is called the pulvinus. The petiole

Leaf bud
(a) base help hold the blade to light. Long thin flexible

petioles allow leaf blades to flutter in wind, thereby
cooling the leaf and bringing fresh air to leaf surface.
The lamina or the leaf blade is the green expanded
part of the leaf with veins and veinlets. There is,
usually, a middle prominent vein, which is known
as the midrib. Veins provide rigidity to the leaf blade
and act as channels of transport for water, minerals
and food materials. The shape, margin, apex, surface
and extent of incision of lamina varies in different
leaves.

5.3.1 Venation

The arrangement of veins and the veinlets in the
lamina of leaf is termed as venation. When the
veinlets form a network, the venation is termed as

(b) (c)

5.3.2 Types of Leaves

A leaf is said to be simple, when its lamina is entire
or when incised, the incisions do not touch the
midrib. When the incisions of the lamina reach up
to the midrib breaking it into a number of leaflets,
the leaf is called compound. A bud is present

number of leaflets are present on a common

In palmately compound leaves, the
leaflets are attached at a common point, i.e.,
at the tip of petiole, as in silk cotton.

5.3.3 Phyllotaxy (a) China rose

Phyllotaxy is the pattern of arrangement of
leaves on the stem or branch. This is usually
of three types – alternate, opposite and
whorled (Figure 5.6). In alternate type of
phyllotaxy,  a single leaf arises at each node
in alternate manner, as in china rose,
mustard and sun flower plants. In opposite

type, a pair of leaves arise at each node and
lie opposite to each other as in Calotropis and Figure 5.6 Different types of phyllotaxy :

(a) Alternate (b) Opposite
guava plants. If more than two leaves arise (c) Whorled
at a node and form a whorl, it is called
whorled, as in Alstonia.

5.4 THE INFLORESCENCE

A flower is a modified shoot wherein the shoot
apical meristem changes to floral meristem.
Internodes do not elongate and the axis gets
condensed. The apex produces different
kinds of floral appendages laterally at
successive nodes instead of leaves.  When a
shoot tip transforms into a flower, it is always
solitary. The arrangement of flowers on the
floral axis is termed as inflorescence.
Depending on whether the apex gets
developed into a flower or continues to grow,
two major types of inflorescences are defined
– racemose and cymose. In racemose type
of inflorescences the main axis continues to
grow, the flowers are borne laterally in an
acropetal succession (Figure 5.7).

In cymose type of  inflorescence the main
axis terminates in a flower, hence is limited
in growth.The flowers are borne in a basipetal Figure 5.7  Racemose inflorescence
order (Figure 5.8).

62 BIOLOGY

5.5 THE FLOWER

The flower is the reproductive unit in the
angiosperms. It is meant for sexual reproduction.
A typical flower has four different kinds of whorls
arranged successively on the swollen end of the
stalk or pedicel, called thalamus or receptacle.
These are calyx, corolla, androecium and
gynoecium. Calyx and corolla are accessory
organs, while androecium and gynoecium are

Figure 5.8  Cymose inflorescence reproductive organs. In some flowers like lily, the
calyx and corolla are not distinct and are termed

as perianth. When a flower has both androecium and gynoecium, it is
bisexual. A flower having either only stamens or only carpels is
unisexual.

In symmetry, the flower may be actinomorphic (radial symmetry) or
zygomorphic (bilateral symmetry). When a flower can be divided into
two equal radial halves in any radial plane passing through the centre, it
is said to be actinomorphic, e.g., mustard, datura, chilli. When it can be
divided into two similar halves only in one particular vertical plane, it is
zygomorphic, e.g., pea, gulmohur, bean, Cassia. A flower is asymmetric
(irregular) if it cannot be divided into two similar halves by any vertical
plane passing through the centre, as in canna.

A flower may be trimerous, tetramerous or pentamerous when
the floral appendages are in multiple of 3, 4 or 5, respectively. Flowers
with bracts-reduced leaf found at the base of the pedicel - are called
bracteate and those without bracts, ebracteate.

MORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 63

Based on the position of calyx, corolla and androecium in respect of
the ovary on thalamus, the flowers are described as hypogynous,
perigynous and epigynous (Figure 5.9). In the hypogynous flower the
gynoecium occupies the highest position while the other parts are situated
below it. The ovary in such flowers is said to be superior, e.g., mustard,
china rose and brinjal. If gynoecium is situated in the centre and other
parts of the flower are located on the rim of the thalamus almost at the
same level, it is called perigynous. The ovary here is said to be half
inferior, e.g., plum, rose, peach. In epigynous flowers, the margin of
thalamus grows upward enclosing the ovary completely and getting fused
with it, the other parts of flower arise above the ovary. Hence, the ovary is
said to be inferior as in flowers of guava and cucumber, and the ray
florets of sunflower.

5.5.1 Parts of a Flower

Each flower normally has four floral whorls, viz., calyx, corolla,
androecium and gynoecium (Figure 5.10).

5.5.1.1 Calyx

The calyx is the outermost whorl of the flower and the members are called
sepals. Generally, sepals are green, leaf like and protect the flower in the
bud stage. The calyx may be gamosepalous (sepals united) or
polysepalous (sepals free).

5.5.1.2 Corolla

Corolla is composed of petals. Petals are usually brightly coloured to
attract insects for pollination. Like calyx, corolla may also be
gamopetalous (petals united) or polypetalous (petals free). The shape
and colour of corolla vary greatly in plants. Corolla may be tubular, bell-
shaped, funnel-shaped or wheel-shaped.

Aestivation: The mode of arrangement of sepals or petals in floral bud
with respect to the other members of the same whorl is known as
aestivation. The main types of aestivation are valvate, twisted, imbricate

and vexillary (Figure 5.11). When sepals or petals in a whorl just touch
one another at the margin, without overlapping, as in Calotropis, it is
said to be valvate. If one margin of  the appendage overlaps that of the
next one and so on as in china rose, lady’s finger and cotton, it is called
twisted.  If the margins of sepals or petals overlap one another but not in
any particular direction as in Cassia and gulmohur, the aestivation is
called imbricate. In pea and bean flowers, there are five petals, the largest
(standard) overlaps the two lateral petals (wings) which in turn overlap
the two smallest anterior petals (keel);  this type of aestivation is known
as vexillary or papilionaceous.

5.5.1.3 Androecium

Androecium is composed of stamens. Each stamen which represents the
male reproductive organ consists of a stalk or a filament and an anther.
Each anther is usually bilobed and each lobe has two chambers, the
pollen-sacs. The pollen grains are produced in pollen-sacs. A sterile stamen
is called staminode.

Stamens of flower may be united with other members such as petals
or among themselves. When stamens are attached to the petals, they are
epipetalous as in brinjal, or epiphyllous when attached to the perianth
as in the flowers of lily. The stamens in a flower may either remain free
(polyandrous) or may be united in varying degrees. The stamens may be
united into one bunch or one bundle (monoadelphous) as in china rose,
or two bundles (diadelphous) as in pea, or into more than two  bundles
(polyadelphous) as in citrus. There may be a variation in the length of
filaments within a flower, as in Salvia and mustard.

5.5.1.4 Gynoecium

Gynoecium is the female reproductive part of the flower and is made
up of one or more carpels. A carpel consists of three parts namely
stigma, style and ovary. Ovary is the enlarged basal part, on which
lies the elongated tube, the style. The style connects the ovary to the
stigma. The stigma is usually at the tip of the style and is the (a)

receptive surface for pollen grains. Each ovary bears one or more
ovules attached to a flattened, cushion-like placenta. When more
than one carpel is present, they may be free (as in lotus and rose)
and are called apocarpous. They are termed syncarpous when
carpels are fused, as in mustard and tomato. After fertilisation, the
ovules develop into seeds and the ovary matures into a fruit.

Placentation: The arrangement of ovules within the ovary is known
as placentation. The placentation are of different types namely, (b)

marginal, axile, parietal, basal, central and free central (Figure 5.12).
In marginal  placentation the placenta forms a ridge along the
ventral suture of the ovary and the ovules are borne on this ridge
forming two rows, as in pea. When the  placenta is axial and the
ovules are attached to it in a multilocular ovary, the placentaion is
said to be axile, as in china rose, tomato and lemon. In parietal
placentation, the ovules develop on the inner wall of the ovary or
on peripheral part. Ovary is one-chambered but it becomes two- (c)

chambered due to the formation of the false septum, e.g., mustard
and Argemone. When the ovules are borne on central axis and
septa are absent, as in Dianthus and Primrose the placentation is
called free central. In basal placentation, the placenta develops
at the base of ovary and a single ovule is attached to it, as in
sunflower, marigold.

5.6 THE FRUIT

The fruit is a characteristic feature of the flowering plants. It is a
mature or ripened ovary, developed after fertilisation. If a fruit is
formed without fertilisation of the ovary, it is called a
parthenocarpic fruit.

Generally, the fruit consists of a wall or pericarp and seeds. (e)

The pericarp may be dry or fleshy. When pericarp is thick and

The ovules after fertilisation, develop into seeds. A seed is made up of a
seed coat and an embryo. The embryo is made up of a radicle, an embryonal
axis and one (as in wheat, maize) or two cotyledons (as in gram and pea).

5.7.1 Structure of a Dicotyledonous Seed

The outermost covering of a seed is the seed coat. The seed coat has two
layers, the outer testa and the inner tegmen. The hilum is a scar on the
seed coat through which the developing seeds were attached to the fruit.

Above the hilum is a small pore called the

Seed coat micropyle. Within the seed coat is the embryo,
Cotyledon

Plumule consisting of an embryonal axis and two
cotyledons. The cotyledons are often fleshy and
full of reserve food materials. At the two ends of
the embryonal axis are present the radicle and
the plumule (Figure 5.14). In some seeds such

Hilum as castor the endosperm formed as a result of

called endospermic seeds. In plants such as
bean, gram and pea, the endosperm is not

called non-endospermous.

5.7.2 Structure of Monocotyledonous Seed

Generally, monocotyledonous seeds are endospermic but some as in
orchids are non-endospermic. In the seeds of cereals such as maize the

seed coat is membranous and generally fused with the fruit wall. The
endosperm is bulky and stores food. The outer covering of endosperm
separates the embryo by a proteinous layer called aleurone layer. The
embryo is   small and situated in a groove at one end of the endosperm. It
consists of one large and shield shaped cotyledon known as scutellum
and a short axis with a plumule and a radicle. The plumule and radicle
are enclosed in sheaths which are called coleoptile and
coleorhiza  respectively (Figure 5.15).

5.8 SEMI-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL

FLOWERING PLANT

Various morphological features are used to describe a
flowering plant. The description has to be brief, in a simple
and scientific language and presented in a proper
sequence. The plant is described beginning with its habit,
vegetative characters – roots, stem and leaves and then
floral characters inflorescence and flower parts. After
describing various parts of plant, a floral diagram and a
floral formula are presented. The floral formula is
represented by some symbols. In the floral formula, Br

and  for zygomorphic nature of flower. Fusion is indicated by enclosing
the figure within bracket and adhesion by a line drawn above the symbols
of the floral parts. A floral diagram provides information about the number
of parts of a flower, their arrangement and the relation they have with one
another (Figure 5.16). The position of the mother axis with respect to the
flower is represented by a dot on the top of the floral diagram. Calyx,
corolla, androecium and gynoecium are drawn in successive whorls, calyx
being the outermost and the gynoecium being in the centre. Floral formula
also shows cohesion and adhesion within parts of whorls and between
whorls. The floral diagram and floral formula in Figure 5.16 represents
the mustard plant (Family: Brassicaceae).

SUMMARY

Flowering plants exhibit enormous variation in shape, size, structure,
mode of nutrition, life span, habit and habitat. They have well developed
root and shoot systems. Root system is either tap root or fibrous. Generally,
dicotyledonous plants have tap roots while monocotyledonous plants have
fibrous roots. The roots in some plants get modified for storage of food,
mechanical support and respiration. The shoot system is differentiated
into stem, leaves, flowers and fruits. The morphological features of stems
like the presence of nodes and internodes, multicellular hair and positively
phototropic nature help to differentiate the stems from roots. Leaf is a
lateral outgrowth of stem developed exogeneously at the node. These are
green in colour to perform the function of photosynthesis. Leaves exhibit
marked variations in their shape, size, margin, apex and extent of incisions
of leaf blade (lamina).

The flower is a modified shoot, meant for sexual reproduction. The
flowers are arranged in different types of inflorescences. They exhibit
enormous variation in structure, symmetry, position of ovary in relation
to other parts, arrangement of petals, sepals, ovules etc. After fertilisation,
the ovary is modified into fruits and ovules into seeds. Seeds either may
be monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous. They vary in shape, size and
period of viability. The floral characteristics form the basis of classification

ANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 71

CHAPTER  6
ANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS

6.1 The Tissue You can very easily see the structural similarities and variations in the
System external morphology of the larger living organism, both plants and

animals. Similarly, if we were to study the internal structure, one also

you to the internal structure and functional organisation of higher plants.
and

Study of internal structure of plants is called anatomy. Plants have cells
Monocotyledonous as the basic unit, cells are organised into tissues and in turn the tissues
Plants are organised into organs. Different organs in a plant show differences in

their internal structure. Within angiosperms, the monocots and dicots
are also seen to be anatomically different. Internal structures also show
adaptations to diverse environments.

6.1 THE TISSUE SYSTEM

We were discussing types of tissues based on the types of cells present.
Let us now consider how tissues vary depending on their location in the
plant body. Their structure and function would also be dependent on
location. On the basis of their structure and location, there are three types
of tissue systems. These are the epidermal tissue system, the ground or
fundamental tissue system and the vascular or conducting tissue system.

6.1.1 Epidermal Tissue System

The epidermal tissue system forms the outer-most covering of the whole
plant body and comprises epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal
appendages – the trichomes and hairs. The epidermis is the outermost
layer of the primary plant body. It is made up of elongated, compactly

Reprint 2025-26



72 BIOLOGY

arranged cells, which form a continuous layer. Epidermis is usually single-
layered. Epidermal cells are parenchymatous with a small amount of
cytoplasm lining the cell wall and a large vacuole. The outside of the
epidermis is often covered with a waxy thick layer called the cuticle which
prevents the loss of water. Cuticle is absent in roots. Stomata are structures
present in the epidermis of leaves. Stomata regulate the process of
transpiration and gaseous exchange. Each stoma is composed of two bean-
shaped cells known as guard cells which enclose stomatal pore. In
grasses, the guard cells are dumb-bell shaped. The outer walls of guard
cells (away from the stomatal pore) are thin and the inner walls (towards
the stomatal pore) are highly thickened. The guard cells possess chloroplasts
and regulate the opening and closing of stomata. Sometimes, a few epidermal
cells, in the vicinity of the guard cells become specialised in their shape and
size and are known as subsidiary cells. The stomatal aperture, guard
cells and the surrounding subsidiary cells are together called stomatal
apparatus (Figure 6.1).

(b) stomata with dumb-bell shaped guard cell

The cells of epidermis bear a number of hairs. The root hairs are
unicellular elongations of the epidermal cells and help absorb water and
minerals from the soil. On the stem the epidermal hairs are called
trichomes. The trichomes in the shoot system are usually multicellular.
They may be branched  or unbranched and soft or stiff. They may even
be secretory. The trichomes help in preventing water loss due to
transpiration.

6.1.2 The Ground Tissue System

All tissues except epidermis and vascular bundles constitute the ground
tissue. It consists of simple tissues such as parenchyma, collenchyma
and sclerenchyma. Parenchymatous cells are usually present in cortex,
pericycle, pith and medullary rays, in the primary stems and roots. In
leaves, the ground tissue consists of thin-walled chloroplast containing
cells and is called mesophyll.

Reprint 2025-26



ANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 73

6.1.3 The Vascular Tissue System

The vascular system consists of complex tissues,
the phloem and the xylem.The xylem and
phloem together constitute vascular bundles
(Figure 6.2). In dicotyledonous stems,
cambium is present between phloem and
xylem. Such vascular bundles because of the
presence of cambium possess the ability to form
secondary xylem and phloem tissues, and hence
are called open vascular bundles. In the
monocotyledons, the vascular bundles have no
cambium present in them. Hence, since they do
not form secondary tissues they are referred to
as closed. When xylem and phloem within a
vascular bundle are arranged in an alternate
manner along the  different radii, the
arrangement is called radial such as in roots.
In conjoint type of vascular bundles, the xylem
and phloem are jointly situated  along the same
radius of vascular bundles. Such vascular
bundles are common in stems and leaves. The
conjoint vascular bundles usually have the
phloem located only on the outer side of xylem.

with intercellular spaces. The innermost
Root hair layer of the cortex is called endodermis.
Epidermis

It comprises a single layer of barrel-
shaped cells without any intercellular

(Figure 6.4 a). Covered with a thin layer of cuticle, it may bear trichomes and
a few stomata. The cells arranged in multiple layers between epidermis and
pericycle constitute the cortex. It consists of three sub-zones. The outer
hypodermis, consists of a few layers of collenchymatous cells just below the
epidermis, which provide mechanical strength to the young stem. Cortical
layers below hypodermis consist of rounded thin walled parenchymatous
cells with conspicuous intercellular spaces. The innermost layer of the cortex
is called the endodermis. The cells of the endodermis are rich in starch
grains and the layer is also referred to as the starch sheath. Pericycle is

76 BIOLOGY

present on the inner side of the endodermis and above the phloem in the
form of semi-lunar patches of sclerenchyma. In between the vascular bundles
there are a few layers of radially placed parenchymatous cells, which constitute
medullary rays. A large number of vascular bundles are arranged in a ring ;
the ‘ring’ arrangement of vascular bundles is a characteristic of dicot stem.
Each vascular bundle is conjoint, open, and with endarch protoxylem. A
large number of rounded, parenchymatous cells with large intercellular
spaces which occupy the central portion of the stem constitute the pith.

6.2.4 Monocotyledonous Stem

The monocot stem has a sclerenchymatous hypodermis, a large number
of scattered vascular bundles, each surrounded by a sclerenchymatous

bundle sheath, and a large, conspicuous
parenchymatous ground tissue (Figure
6.4 b). Vascular bundles are conjoint  and
closed. Peripheral vascular bundles are
generally smaller than the centrally
located ones. The phloem parenchyma is
absent, and water-containing cavities are
present within the vascular bundles.

6.2.5 Dorsiventral
(Dicotyledonous) Leaf

The vertical section of a dorsiventral leaf
through the lamina shows three main
parts, namely, epidermis, mesophyll and
vascular system. The epidermis which
covers both the upper surface (adaxial
epidermis) and lower  surface (abaxial
epidermis) of the leaf has a conspicuous
cuticle. The abaxial epidermis generally
bears more stomata than the adaxial
epidermis. The latter may even lack
stomata. The tissue between the upper
and the lower epidermis is called the
mesophyll. Mesophyll, which possesses
chloroplasts and carry out
photosynthesis, is made up of
parenchyma. It has two types of cells – the
palisade parenchyma and the spongy
parenchyma. The adaxially placed
palisade parenchyma is made up of

Figure 6.5  T.S. of leaf : (a) Dicot  (b) Monocot elongated cells, which are arranged

Reprint 2025-26



ANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 77

vertically and parallel to each other. The oval or round and loosely arranged
spongy parenchyma is situated below the palisade cells and extends to
the lower epidermis. There are numerous large spaces and air cavities
between these cells.  Vascular system includes vascular bundles, which
can be seen in the veins and the midrib. The size of the vascular bundles
are dependent on the size of the veins. The veins vary in thickness in the
reticulate venation of the dicot leaves. The vascular bundles are
surrounded by a layer of thick walled bundle sheath cells. Look at
Figure 6.5 (a) and find the position of xylem in the vascular bundle.

6.2.6 Isobilateral (Monocotyledonous) Leaf

The anatomy of isobilateral leaf is similar to that of the dorsiventral leaf in
many ways. It shows the following characteristic differences. In an
isobilateral leaf, the stomata are present on both the surfaces of the
epidermis; and the mesophyll is not differentiated into palisade and spongy
parenchyma (Figure 6.5 b).

In grasses, certain adaxial epidermal cells along the veins modify
themselves into large, empty, colourless cells. These are called bulliform
cells. When the bulliform cells in the leaves have absorbed water and are
turgid, the leaf surface is exposed. When they are flaccid due to water
stress, they make the leaves curl inwards to minimise water loss.

The parallel venation in monocot leaves is reflected in the near similar
sizes of vascular bundles (except in main veins) as seen in vertical sections
of the leaves.

SUMMARY

Anatomically, a plant is made of different kinds of tissues. The plant tissues are
broadly classified into meristematic (apical, lateral and intercalary) and permanent
(simple and complex). Assimilation of food and its storage, transportation of water,
minerals and photosynthates, and mechanical support are the main functions
of tissues. There are three types of tissue  systems – epidermal, ground and
vascular. The epidermal tissue systems are made of epidermal cells, stomata
and the epidermal appendages. The ground tissue system forms the main bulk
of the plant. It is divided into three zones – cortex, pericycle and pith. The vascular
tissue system is formed by the xylem and phloem. On the basis of presence of
cambium, location of xylem and phloem, the vascular bundles are of different
types. The vascular bundles form the conducting tissue and translocate water,
minerals and food material.

Monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants show marked variation in their
internal structures. They differ in type, number and location of vascular bundles.
The secondary growth occurs in most of the dicotyledonous roots and stems.

STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 79

STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN

ANIMALS

7.1 Organ and Organ In the preceding chapters you came across a large variety of organisms,
System both unicellular and multicellular, of the animal kingdom. In unicellular

organisms, all functions like digestion, respiration and reproduction
7.2 Frogs

are performed by a single cell. In the complex body of multicellular
animals the same basic functions are carried out by different groups of
cells in a well organised manner. The body of a simple organism like
Hydra is made of different types of cells and the number of cells in each
type can be in thousands. The human body is composed of billions of
cells to perform various functions. How do these cells in the body work
together? As you have already learnt in your earlier classes, in
multicellular animals, a group of similar cells alongwith intercellular
substances perform a specific function. Such an organisation is called
tissue.

You may be surprised to know that all complex animals consist of
only four basic types of tissues. These tissues are organised in specific
proportion and pattern to form an organ like stomach, lung, heart and
kidney. When two or more organs perform a common function by their
physical and/or chemical interaction, they together form organ system,
e.g., digestive system, respiratory system, etc. Cells, tissues, organs and
organ systems split up the work in a way that exhibits division of labour
and contribute to the survival of the body as a whole.

7.1 ORGAN AND ORGAN SYSTEM

The basic tissues as you have learnt in earlier classes, organise to form
organs which in turn associate to form organ systems in the multicellular
organisms. Such an organisation is essential for more efficient and better
coordinated activities of millions of cells constituting an organism. Each

Reprint 2025-26



80 BIOLOGY

organ in our body is made of one or more type of tissues. For example,
our heart consists of all the four types of tissues, i.e., epithelial, connective,
muscular and neural. We also notice, after some careful study that the
complexity in organ and organ systems displays certain discernable trend.
This discernable trend is called evolutionary trend (You will study the
details in class XII). In this chapter, you are being introduced to
morphology and anatomy of frog. Morphology refers to study of form or
externally visible features. In the case of plants or microbes, the term
morphology precisely means only this. In case of animals this refers to
the external appearance of the organs or parts of the body. The word
anatomy conventionally is used for the study of morphology of internal
organs in the animals. You will learn the morphology and anatomy of
frog representing vertebrates.

7.2 FROGS

Frogs can live both on land and in freshwater and belong to class Amphibia
of phylum Chordata. The most common species of frog found in India is
Rana tigrina.

They do not have constant body temperature i.e., their body
temperature varies with the temperature of the environment. Such animals
are called cold blooded or poikilotherms. You might have also noticed
changes in the colour of the frogs while they are in grasses and on dry
land. They have the ability to change the colour to hide them from their
enemies (camouflage). This protective coloration is called mimicry.  You
may also know that frogs are not seen during peak summer and winter.
During this period they take shelter in deep burrows to protect them
from extreme heat and cold. This is known as summer sleep (aestivation)
and winter sleep (hibernation) respectively.

7.2.1 Morphology

Have you ever touched the skin of frog? The skin is smooth and slippery
due to the presence of mucus. The skin is always maintained in a moist

condition. The colour of dorsal side of body is
Head generally olive green with dark irregular spots.  On

Trunk
the ventral side the skin is uniformly pale yellow.

Eye The frog never drinks water but absorb it through
the skin.

Body of a frog is divisible into head and trunk
(Figure 7.1). A neck and tail are absent. Above the

Fore limb mouth, a pair of nostrils is present.  Eyes are bulged
and covered by a nictitating membrane that

Hind limb protects them while in water. On either side of eyes
a membranous tympanum (ear) receives sound

Figure 7.1  External features of frog signals. The forelimbs and hind limbs help in

Reprint 2025-26



STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 81

swimming, walking, leaping and burrowing. The hind limbs end in five
digits and they are larger and muscular than fore limbs that end in four
digits. Feet have webbed digits that help in swimming. Frogs exhibit sexual
dimorphism. Male frogs can be distinguished by the presence of sound
producing vocal sacs and also a copulatory pad on the first digit of the
fore limbs which are absent in female frogs.

7.2.2 Anatomy

The body cavity of frogs accommodate different organ systems such as
digestive, circulatory, respiratory, nervous, excretory and reproductive
systems with well developed structures and functions  (Figure 7.2).

The digestive system consists of alimentary canal and digestive glands.
The alimentary canal is short because frogs are carnivores and hence the
length of intestine is reduced. The mouth opens into the buccal cavity that
leads to the oesophagus through pharynx. Oesophagus is a short tube
that opens into the stomach which in turn continues as the intestine, rectum
and finally opens outside by the cloaca.  Liver secretes bile that is stored in
the gall bladder. Pancreas, a digestive gland produces pancreatic juice

containing digestive enzymes. Food is captured by the bilobed tongue.
Digestion of food takes place by the action of HCl and gastric juices secreted
from  the walls of the stomach. Partially digested food called chyme is passed
from stomach to the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. The
duodenum receives bile from gall bladder and pancreatic juices from the
pancreas through a common bile duct. Bile emulsifies fat and pancreatic
juices digest carbohydrates and proteins. Final digestion takes place in the
intestine. Digested food is absorbed by the numerous finger-like folds in
the inner wall of intestine called villi and microvilli. The undigested solid
waste moves into the rectum and passes out through cloaca.

Frogs respire on land and in the water by two different methods. In
water, skin acts as aquatic respiratory organ (cutaneous respiration).
Dissolved oxygen in the water is exchanged through the skin by diffusion.
On land, the buccal cavity, skin and lungs act as the respiratory organs.
The respiration by lungs is called pulmonary respiration. The lungs are a
pair of elongated, pink coloured sac-like structures present in the upper
part of the trunk region (thorax). Air enters through the nostrils into the
buccal cavity and then to lungs. During aestivation and hibernation
gaseous exchange takes place through skin.

The vascular system of frog is well-developed closed type. Frogs have
a lymphatic system also. The blood vascular system involves heart, blood
vessels and blood. The lymphatic system consists of lymph, lymph
channels and lymph nodes. Heart is a muscular structure situated in the
upper part of the body cavity. It has three chambers, two atria and one
ventricle and is covered by a membrane called pericardium. A triangular
structure called sinus venosus joins the right atrium. It receives blood
through the major veins called vena cava. The ventricle opens into a sac-
like conus arteriosus on the ventral side of the heart. The blood from the
heart is carried to all parts of the body by the arteries (arterial system).
The veins collect blood from different parts of body to the heart and form
the venous system. Special venous connection between liver and intestine
as well as the kidney and lower parts of the body are present in frogs. The
former is called hepatic portal system and the latter is called renal portal
system. The blood is composed of plasma and cells. The blood cells are
RBC (red blood cells) or erythrocytes, WBC (white blood cells) or leucocytes
and platelets. RBC’s are nucleated and contain red coloured pigment
namely haemoglobin. The lymph is different from blood. It lacks few
proteins and RBCs. The blood carries nutrients, gases and water to the
respective sites during the circulation. The circulation of blood is achieved
by the pumping action of the muscular heart.

The elimination of nitrogenous wastes is carried out by a well
developed excretory system. The excretory system consists of a pair of
kidneys, ureters, cloaca and urinary bladder. These are compact, dark
red and bean like structures situated a little posteriorly in the body cavity
on both sides of vertebral column. Each kidney is composed of several
structural and functional units called uriniferous tubules or nephrons.
Two ureters emerge from the kidneys in the male frogs. The ureters act as
urinogenital duct which opens into the cloaca. In females the ureters and

Reprint 2025-26



STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 83

oviduct open seperately in the cloaca. The thin-walled urinary bladder is
present ventral to the rectum which also opens in the cloaca. The frog
excretes urea and thus is a ureotelic animal. Excretory wastes are carried
by blood into the kidney where it is separated and excreted.

The system for control and coordination is highly evolved in the frog. It
includes both neural system and endocrine glands. The chemical
coordination of various organs of the body is Vasa
achieved by hormones which are secreted by the efferentia

endocrine glands. The prominent endocrine
glands found in frog are pituitary, thyroid, Fat

nerves arising from the brain. Brain is enclosed genital duct
in a bony structure called brain box (cranium).
The brain is divided into fore-brain, mid-brain Rectum

lobes, paired cerebral hemispheres and unpaired Urinary Cloacal

a pair of optic lobes. Hind-brain consists of
cerebellum and medulla oblongata. The medulla Figure 7.3 Male reproductive system

is enclosed in the vertebral column.

Frog has different types of sense organs, namely Oviduct
organs of touch (sensory papillae), taste (taste
buds), smell (nasal epithelium), vision (eyes) and
hearing (tympanum with internal ears). Out of
these, eyes and internal ears are well-organised Ovary

structures and the rest are cellular aggregations Ova

spherical structures situated in the orbit in skull.
These are simple eyes (possessing only one unit). Ureter

can be seen externally. The ear is an organ of
hearing as well as balancing (equilibrium).

Frogs have well organised male and female
reproductive systems. Male reproductive organs

canal. Finally it communicates with the urinogenital duct that comes out
of the kidneys and opens into the cloaca. The cloaca is a small, median
chamber that is used to pass faecal matter, urine and sperms to the exterior.

The female reproductive organs include a pair of ovaries (Figure 7.4).
The ovaries are situated near kidneys and there is no functional connection
with kidneys. A pair of oviduct arising from the ovaries opens into the
cloaca separately. A mature female can lay 2500 to 3000 ova at a time.
Fertilisation is external and takes place in water. Development involves a
larval stage called tadpole. Tadpole undergoes metamorphosis to form
the adult.

Frogs are beneficial for mankind because they eat insects and protect
the crop. Frogs maintain ecological balance because these serve as an
important link of food chain and food web in the ecosystem. In some
countries the muscular legs of frog are used as food by man.

SUMMARY

Cells, tissues, organs and organ systems split up the work in a way that
ensures the survival of the body as a whole and exhibit division of labour.
A tissue is defined as group of cells along with intercellular substances
performing one or more functions in the body. Epithelia are sheet like
tissues lining the body’s surface and its cavities, ducts and tubes. Epithelia
have one free surface facing a body fluid or the outside environment.
Their cells are structurally and functionally connected at junctions.

The Indian bullfrog, Rana tigrina, is the common frog found in India.
Body is covered by skin. Mucous glands are present in the skin which is
highly vascularised and helps in respiration in water and on land. Body is
divisible into head and trunk. A muscular tongue is present, which is bilobed
at the tip and is used in capturing the prey. The alimentary canal consists
of oesophagous, stomach, intestine and rectum, which open into the cloaca.
The main digestive glands are liver and pancreas. It can respire in water
through skin and through lungs on land. Circulatory system is closed
with single circulation. RBCs are nucleated. Nervous system is organised
into central, peripheral and autonomic. The organs of urinogenital system
are kidneys and urinogenital ducts, which open into the cloaca. The male
reproductive organ is a pair of testes. The female reproductive organ is a
pair of ovaries. A female lays 2500-3000 ova at a time. The fertilisation and
development are external. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which
metamorphose into frogs.

in molecular terms. The approach is established by analysis of living
tissues for elements and compounds. It will tell us what types of organic
compounds are present in living organisms. In the next stage, one can
ask the question: What are these compounds doing inside a cell? And,
in what way they carry out gross physiological processes like digestion,
excretion, memory, defense, recognition, etc. In other words we answer
the question, what is the molecular basis of all physiological processes?
It can also explain the abnormal processes that occur during any
diseased condition. This physico-chemical approach to study and
understand living organisms is called ‘Reductionist Biology’. The
concepts and techniques of physics and chemistry are applied to
understand biology. In Chapter 9 of this unit, a brief description of
biomolecules is provided.

G.N. RAMACHANDRAN, an outstanding figure in the field of protein
structure, was the founder of the ‘Madras school’ of
conformational analysis of biopolymers. His discovery of the triple
helical structure of collagen published in Nature in 1954 and his
analysis of the allowed conformations of proteins through the
use of the ‘Ramachandran plot’ rank among the most outstanding
contributions in structural biology. He was born on October 8,
1922, in a small town, not far from Cochin on the southwestern
coast of India. His father was a professor of mathematics at a
local college and thus had considerable influence in shaping
Ramachandran’s interest in mathematics. After completing his
school years, Ramachandran graduated in 1942 as the top-
ranking student in the B.Sc. (Honors) Physics course of the
University of Madras. He received a Ph.D. from Cambridge
University in 1949. While at Cambridge, Ramachandran met
Linus Pauling and was deeply influenced by his publications on

CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE

8.1 What is a Cell? When you look around, you see both living and non-living things. You

8.2 Cell Theory must have wondered and asked yourself – ‘what is it that makes an
organism living, or what is it that an inanimate thing does not have which

8.3 An Overview of
a living thing has’ ? The answer to this is the presence of the basic unit of

Cell
life – the cell in all living organisms.

8.4 Prokaryotic Cells All organisms are composed of cells. Some are composed of a single

8.5 Eukaryotic Cells cell and are called unicellular organisms while others, like us, composed
of many cells, are called multicellular organisms.

8.1 WHAT IS A CELL?

Unicellular organisms are capable of (i) independent existence and
(ii) performing the essential functions of life. Anything less than a complete
structure of a cell does not ensure independent living. Hence, cell is the
fundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms.

Antonie Von Leeuwenhoek first saw and described a live cell. Robert
Brown later discovered the nucleus. The invention of the microscope and
its improvement leading to the electron microscope revealed all the
structural details of the cell.

8.2 CELL THEORY

In 1838, Matthias Schleiden, a German botanist, examined a large number
of plants and observed that all plants are composed of different kinds of
cells which form the tissues of the plant. At about the same time, Theodore

Reprint 2025-26



88 BIOLOGY

Schwann (1839), a German Zoologist, studied different types of animal
cells and reported that cells had a thin outer layer which is today known
as the ‘plasma membrane’. He also concluded, based on his studies on
plant tissues, that the presence of cell wall is a unique character of
the plant cells. On the basis of this, Schwann proposed the hypothesis
that the bodies of animals and plants are composed of cells and
products of cells.

Schleiden and Schwann together formulated the cell theory. This
theory however, did not explain as to how new cells were formed. Rudolf
Virchow (1855) first explained that cells divided and new cells are formed
from pre-existing cells (Omnis cellula-e cellula). He modified the
hypothesis of Schleiden and Schwann to give the cell theory a final
shape. Cell theory as understood today is:

(i) all living organisms are composed of cells and products of cells.

(ii) all cells arise from pre-existing cells.

8.3 AN OVERVIEW OF CELL

You have earlier observed cells in an onion peel and/or human cheek
cells under the microscope. Let us recollect their structure. The onion cell
which is a typical plant cell, has a distinct cell wall as its outer boundary
and just within it is the cell membrane. The cells of the human cheek
have an outer membrane as the delimiting structure of the cell. Inside
each cell is a dense membrane bound structure called nucleus. This
nucleus contains the chromosomes which in turn contain the genetic
material, DNA. Cells that have membrane bound nuclei are called
eukaryotic whereas cells that lack a membrane bound nucleus are
prokaryotic. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, a semi-fluid matrix
called cytoplasm occupies the volume of the cell. The cytoplasm is the
main arena of cellular activities in both the plant and animal cells. Various
chemical reactions occur in it to keep the cell in the ‘living state’.

Besides the nucleus, the eukaryotic cells have other membrane bound
distinct structures called organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
the golgi complex, lysosomes, mitochondria, microbodies and vacuoles.
The prokaryotic cells lack such membrane bound organelles.

Ribosomes are non-membrane bound organelles found in all cells –
both eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic. Within the cell, ribosomes are
found not only in the cytoplasm but also within the two organelles –
chloroplasts (in plants) and mitochondria and on rough ER.

Animal cells contain another non-membrane bound organelle called
centrosome which helps in cell division.

Cells differ greatly in size, shape and activities (Figure 8.1). For example,
Mycoplasmas, the smallest cells, are only 0.3 mm in length while bacteria

could be 3 to 5 µm. The largest isolated single cell is the egg of an ostrich.
Among multicellular organisms, human red blood cells are about 7.0
µm in diameter. Nerve cells are some of the longest cells. Cells also vary
greatly in their shape. They may be disc-like, polygonal, columnar, cuboid,
thread like, or even irregular. The shape of the cell may vary with the
function they perform.

8.4 PROKARYOTIC CELLS

The prokaryotic cells are represented by bacteria, blue-green algae,
mycoplasma and PPLO (Pleuro Pneumonia Like Organisms). They are
generally smaller and multiply more rapidly than the eukaryotic cells
(Figure 8.2). They may vary greatly in shape and size. The four basic
shapes of bacteria are bacillus (rod like), coccus (spherical), vibrio (comma
shaped) and spirillum (spiral).

The organisation of the prokaryotic cell is fundamentally similar even
though prokaryotes exhibit a wide variety of shapes and functions. All

Figure 8.2 Diagram showing comparison of in eukaryotes. No organelles, like the ones in
eukaryotic cell with other eukaryotes, are found in prokaryotic cells except
organisms for ribosomes. Prokaryotes have something

unique in the form of inclusions. A specialised
differentiated form of cell membrane called mesosome is the characteristic
of prokaryotes. They are essentially infoldings of cell membrane.

8.4.1 Cell Envelope and its Modifications

Most prokaryotic cells, particularly the bacterial cells, have a chemically
complex cell envelope. The cell envelope consists of a tightly bound three
layered structure i.e., the outermost glycocalyx followed by the cell wall and
then the plasma membrane. Although each layer of the envelope performs
distinct function, they act together as a single protective unit. Bacteria can
be classified into two groups on the basis of the differences in the cell envelopes
and the manner in which they respond to the staining procedure developed
by Gram viz., those that take up the gram stain are Gram positive and the
others that do not are called Gram negative bacteria.

Glycocalyx differs in composition and thickness among different
bacteria. It could be a loose sheath called the slime layer in some, while
in others it may be thick and tough, called the capsule. The cell wall
determines the shape of the cell and provides a strong structural support
to prevent the bacterium from bursting or collapsing.

The plasma membrane is selectively permeable in nature and interacts
with the outside world. This membrane is similar structurally to that of
the eukaryotes.

A special membranous structure is the mesosome which is formed
by the extensions of plasma membrane into the cell. These extensions
are in the form of vesicles, tubules and lamellae. They help in cell wall

Reprint 2025-26



CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 91

formation, DNA replication and distribution to daughter cells. They also
help in respiration, secretion processes, to increase the surface area of
the plasma membrane and enzymatic content. In some prokaryotes like
cyanobacteria, there are other membranous extensions into the cytoplasm
called chromatophores which contain pigments.

Bacterial cells may be motile or non-motile. If motile, they have thin
filamentous extensions from their cell wall called flagella. Bacteria show a
range in the number and arrangement of flagella. Bacterial flagellum is
composed of three parts – filament, hook and basal body. The filament
is the longest portion and extends from the cell surface to the outside.

Besides flagella, Pili and Fimbriae are also surface structures of the
bacteria but do not play a role in motility. The pili are elongated tubular
structures made of a special protein. The fimbriae are small bristle like
fibres sprouting out of the cell. In some bacteria, they are known to help
attach the bacteria  to rocks in streams and also to the host tissues.

8.4.2 Ribosomes and Inclusion Bodies

In prokaryotes, ribosomes are associated with the plasma membrane of
the cell. They are about 15 nm by 20 nm in size and are made of two
subunits - 50S and 30S units which when present together form 70S
prokaryotic ribosomes. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Several
ribosomes may attach to a single mRNA and form a chain called
polyribosomes or polysome. The ribosomes of a polysome translate the
mRNA into proteins.

Inclusion bodies: Reserve material in prokaryotic cells are stored in
the cytoplasm in the form of inclusion bodies. These are not bound by
any membrane system and lie free in the cytoplasm, e.g., phosphate
granules, cyanophycean granules and glycogen granules. Gas vacuoles
are found in blue green and purple and green photosynthetic bacteria.

8.5 EUKARYOTIC CELLS

The eukaryotes include all the protists, plants, animals and fungi. In
eukaryotic cells there is an extensive compartmentalisation of cytoplasm
through the presence of membrane bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells
possess an organised nucleus with a nuclear envelope. In addition,
eukaryotic cells have a variety of complex locomotory and cytoskeletal
structures. Their genetic material is organised into chromosomes.

All eukaryotic cells are not identical. Plant and animal cells are different
as the former possess cell walls, plastids and a large central vacuole which
are absent in animal cells. On the other hand, animal cells have centrioles
which are absent in almost all plant cells (Figure 8.3).

CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 93

Let us now look at individual cell organelles to understand their
structure and functions.

8.5.1 Cell Membrane

The detailed structure of the membrane was studied only after the advent
of the electron microscope in the 1950s. Meanwhile, chemical studies on
the cell membrane, especially in human red blood cells (RBCs), enabled
the scientists to deduce the possible structure of plasma membrane.

These studies showed that the cell membrane is mainly composed of
lipids and proteins. The major lipids are phospholipids that are arranged
in a bilayer. Also, the lipids are arranged within the membrane with the
polar head towards the outer sides and the hydrophobic tails towards
the inner part.This ensures that the nonpolar tail of saturated
hydrocarbons is protected from the aqueous environment (Figure 8.4).
In addition to phospholipids, membrane also contains cholesterol.

Later, biochemical investigation clearly revealed that the cell membranes
also possess protein and carbohydrate. The ratio of protein and lipid varies
considerably in different cell types. In human beings, the  membrane of the
erythrocyte has approximately 52 per cent protein and 40 per cent lipids.

Depending on the ease of extraction, membrane proteins can be
classified as integral and peripheral. Peripheral proteins lie on the surface
of membrane while the integral proteins are partially or totally buried
in the membrane.

Reprint 2025-26



94 BIOLOGY

An improved model of  the structure of cell membrane was proposed
by Singer and Nicolson (1972) widely accepted as fluid mosaic model
(Figure 8.4). According to this, the quasi-fluid nature of lipid enables
lateral movement of proteins within the overall bilayer. This ability to move
within the membrane is measured as its fluidity.

The fluid nature of the membrane is also important from the point of
view of functions like cell growth, formation of intercellular junctions,
secretion, endocytosis, cell division etc.

One of the most important functions of the plasma membrane is the
transport of the molecules across it. The membrane is selectively permeable
to some molecules present on either side of it. Many molecules can move
briefly across the membrane without any requirement of energy and this
is called the passive transport. Neutral solutes may move across the
membrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentration
gradient, i.e., from higher concentration to the lower. Water may also move
across this membrane from higher to lower concentration. Movement of
water by diffusion is called osmosis. As the polar molecules cannot pass
through the nonpolar lipid bilayer, they require a carrier protein of the
membrane to facilitate their transport across the membrane. A few ions
or molecules are transported across the membrane against their
concentration gradient, i.e., from lower to the higher concentration. Such
a transport is an energy dependent process, in which ATP is utilised and
is called active transport, e.g., Na+/K+ Pump.

8.5.2 Cell Wall

As you may recall, a non-living rigid structure called the cell wall forms
an outer covering for the plasma membrane of fungi and plants. Cell wall
not only gives shape to the cell and protects the cell from mechanical
damage and infection, it also helps in cell-to-cell interaction and provides
barrier to undesirable macromolecules. Algae have cell wall, made of
cellulose, galactans, mannans and minerals like calcium carbonate, while
in other plants it consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and proteins.
The cell wall of a young plant cell, the primary wall is capable of growth,
which gradually diminishes as the cell matures and the secondary wall is
formed on the inner (towards membrane) side of the cell.

The middle lamella is a layer mainly of calcium pectate which holds
or glues the different neighbouring cells together. The cell wall and middle
lamellae may be traversed by plasmodesmata which connect the cytoplasm
of neighbouring cells.

8.5.3 Endomembrane System

While each of the membranous organelles is distinct in terms of its

Reprint 2025-26



CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 95

structure and function, many of these are
considered together as an endomembrane system Nucleus

because their functions are coordinated. The Nuclear pore Rough
endoplasmic

endomembrane system include endoplasmic reticulum

reticulum (ER), golgi complex, lysosomes and
vacuoles. Since the functions of the mitochondria,
chloroplast and peroxisomes are not coordinated
with the above components, these are not
considered as part of the endomembrane system.

8.5.3.1 The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

Electron microscopic studies of eukaryotic cells
reveal the presence of a network or reticulum of
tiny tubular structures scattered in the cytoplasm
that is called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
(Figure 8.5).  Hence, ER divides the intracellular
space into two distinct compartments, i.e., luminal

Ribosome
(inside ER) and extra luminal (cytoplasm)
compartments.

The ER often shows ribosomes attached to
their outer surface. The endoplasmic reticulun
bearing ribosomes on their surface is called rough
endoplasmic reticulum (RER). In the absence of Smooth

Endoplasmic
ribosomes they appear smooth and are called reticulum
smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). Figure 8.5 Endoplasmic reticulum

RER is frequently observed in the cells actively
involved in protein synthesis and secretion. They

Cisternae
are extensive and continuous with the outer
membrane of the nucleus.

The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the major
site for synthesis of lipid. In animal cells lipid-like
steroidal hormones are synthesised in SER.

8.5.3.2 Golgi apparatus

Camillo Golgi (1898) first observed densely stained
reticular structures near the nucleus. These were
later named Golgi bodies after him. They consist
of many flat, disc-shaped sacs or cisternae of
0.5µm to 1.0µm diameter (Figure 8.6). These are
stacked parallel to each other. Varied number of
cisternae are present in a Golgi complex. The Golgi
cisternae are concentrically arranged near the
nucleus with distinct convex cis or the forming Figure 8.6  Golgi apparatus

Reprint 2025-26



96 BIOLOGY

face and concave trans or the maturing face.
The cis and the trans faces of the organelle are entirely different, but
interconnected.

The golgi apparatus principally performs the function of packaging
materials, to be delivered either to the intra-cellular targets or secreted
outside the cell. Materials to be packaged in the form of vesicles from
the ER fuse with the cis face of the golgi apparatus and move towards
the maturing face. This explains, why the golgi apparatus remains in
close association with the endoplasmic reticulum. A number of proteins
synthesised by ribosomes on the endoplasmic reticulum are modified
in the cisternae of the golgi apparatus before they are released from its
trans face. Golgi apparatus is the important site of formation of
glycoproteins and glycolipids.

8.5.3.3 Lysosomes

These are membrane bound vesicular structures formed by the
process of packaging in the golgi apparatus. The isolated lysosomal
vesicles have been found to be very rich in almost all types of
hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases – lipases, proteases, carbohydrases)
optimally active at the acidic pH. These enzymes are capable of
digesting carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids.

8.5.3.4 Vacuoles

The vacuole is the membrane-bound space found in the cytoplasm. It
contains water, sap, excretory product and other materials not useful for
the cell. The vacuole is bound by a single membrane called tonoplast. In
plant cells the vacuoles can occupy up to 90 per cent of the volume of the
cell.

In plants, the tonoplast facilitates the transport of a number of ions
and other materials against concentration gradients into the vacuole, hence
their concentration is significantly higher in the vacuole than in the
cytoplasm.

In Amoeba, the contractile vacuole is important for osmoregulation
and excretion. In many cells, as in protists, food vacuoles are formed by
engulfing the food particles.

8.5.4 Mitochondria

Mitochondria (sing.: mitochondrion), unless specifically stained, are not
easily visible under the microscope. The number of mitochondria per cell
is variable depending on the physiological activity of the cells. In terms of
shape and size also, considerable degree of variability is observed. Typically
it is sausage-shaped or cylindrical having a diameter of 0.2-1.0µm (average
0.5µm) and length 1.0-4.1µm. Each mitochondrion is a double

membrane-bound structure with the outer membrane and the inner
membrane dividing its lumen distinctly into two aqueous compartments,
i.e., the outer compartment and the inner compartment. The inner
compartment is filled with a dense homogeneous substance called the
matrix. The outer membrane forms the continuous limiting boundary of
the organelle. The inner membrane forms a number of infoldings called
the cristae (sing.: crista) towards the matrix (Figure 8.7). The cristae
increase the surface area. The two membranes have their own specific
enzymes associated with the mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are
the sites of aerobic respiration. They produce cellular energy in the form
of ATP, hence they are called ‘power houses’ of the cell. The matrix also
possesses single circular DNA molecule, a few RNA molecules, ribosomes
(70S) and the components required for the synthesis of proteins. The
mitochondria divide by fission.

8.5.5 Plastids

Plastids are found in all plant cells and in euglenoides. These are easily
observed under the microscope as they are large. They bear some specific
pigments, thus imparting specific colours to the plants. Based on the
type of pigments plastids can be classified into chloroplasts,
chromoplasts and leucoplasts.

The chloroplasts contain chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments which
are responsible for trapping light energy essential for photosynthesis. In
the chromoplasts, fat soluble carotenoid pigments like carotene,
xanthophylls and others are present. This gives the part of the plant a
yellow, orange or red colour. The leucoplasts are the colourless plastids
of varied shapes and sizes with stored nutrients: Amyloplasts store
carbohydrates (starch), e.g., potato; elaioplasts store oils and fats whereas

Reprint 2025-26

the aleuroplasts store proteins.
Majority of the chloroplasts of the green

plants are found in the mesophyll cells of
the leaves. These are lens-shaped, oval,
spherical, discoid or even ribbon-like
organelles having variable length (5-10µm)
and width (2-4µm). Their number varies
from 1 per cell of the Chlamydomonas, a
green alga to 20-40 per cell in the mesophyll.

Like mitochondria, the chloroplasts are
also double membrane bound. Of the two,

Figure 8.8  Sectional view of chloroplast
the  inner chloroplast membrane is relatively
less permeable. The space limited by the

inner membrane of the chloroplast is called the stroma. A number of organised
flattened membranous sacs called the thylakoids, are present in the stroma
(Figure 8.8). Thylakoids are arranged in stacks  like the piles of coins called
grana (singular: granum) or the intergranal thylakoids. In addition, there are
flat membranous tubules called the stroma lamellae connecting the thylakoids
of the different grana. The membrane of the thylakoids enclose a space called
a lumen. The stroma of the chloroplast contains enzymes required for the
synthesis of carbohydrates and proteins. It also contains small, double-
stranded circular DNA molecules and ribosomes. Chlorophyll pigments are
present in the thylakoids. The ribosomes of the chloroplasts are smaller (70S)
than the cytoplasmic ribosomes (80S).

8.5.6 Ribosomes

Ribosomes are the granular structures first observed under the electron
microscope as dense particles by George Palade (1953). They are

composed of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins and
are not surrounded by any membrane.

The eukaryotic ribosomes are 80S while the
prokaryotic ribosomes are 70S. Each ribosome has two
subunits, larger and smaller subunits (Fig 8.9). The two
subunits of 80S ribosomes are 60S and 40S while that
of 70S ribosomes are 50S and 30S. Here ‘S’ (Svedberg’s
Unit) stands for the sedimentation coefficient; it is
indirectly a measure of density and size. Both 70S and

Figure 8.9 Ribosome
80S ribosomes are composed of two subunits.

8.5.7 Cytoskeleton

An elaborate network of filamentous proteinaceous structures consisting
of microtubules, microfilaments and intermediate filaments present in
the cytoplasm is collectively referred to as the cytoskeleton. The
cytoskeleton  in a cell are involved in many functions such as mechanical
support, motility, maintenance of the shape of the cell.

8.5.8 Cilia and Flagella

Cilia (sing.: cilium) and flagella (sing.: flagellum) are hair-like outgrowths
of the cell membrane.  Cilia are small structures which work like oars,
causing the movement of either the cell or the surrounding fluid. Flagella
are comparatively longer and responsible for cell movement. The
prokaryotic bacteria also possess flagella but these are structurally
different from that of the eukaryotic flagella.

The electron microscopic study of a cilium or the flagellum show that
they are covered with plasma membrane. Their core called the axoneme,
possesses a number of microtubules running parallel to the long axis.
The axoneme usually has nine doublets of radially arranged peripheral
microtubules, and a pair of centrally located microtubules. Such an
arrangement of axonemal microtubules is referred to as the 9+2 array
(Figure 8.10). The central tubules are connected by bridges and is also
enclosed by a central sheath, which is connected to one of the tubules of
each peripheral doublets by a radial spoke. Thus, there are nine radial
spokes. The peripheral doublets are also interconnected by linkers. Both
the cilium and flagellum emerge from centriole-like structure called the
basal bodies.

8.5.9 Centrosome and Centrioles

Centrosome is an organelle usually containing two cylindrical structures
called centrioles. They are surrounded by amorphous pericentriolar
materials. Both the centrioles in a centrosome lie perpendicular to each
other in which each has an organisation like the cartwheel. They are

made up of nine evenly spaced peripheral fibrils of tubulin protein. Each
of the peripheral fibril is a triplet.The adjacent triplets are also linked.
The central part of the proximal region of the centriole is also proteinaceous
and called the hub, which is connected with tubules of the peripheral
triplets by radial spokes made of protein. The centrioles form the basal
body of cilia or flagella, and spindle fibres that give rise to spindle
apparatus during cell division in animal cells.

8.5.10 Nucleus

Nucleus as a cell organelle was first described by Robert Brown as early
as 1831. Later the material of the nucleus stained by the basic dyes was
given the name chromatin by Flemming.

The interphase nucleus (nucleus of a
cell when it is not dividing) has highly
extended and elaborate nucleoprotein
fibres called chromatin, nuclear matrix
and one or more spherical bodies called

Nucleoplasm
nucleoli (sing.: nucleolus) (Figure 8.11).
Electron microscopy has revealed that the

materials present inside the nucleus and
that of the cytoplasm. The outer

Figure 8.11  Structure of nucleus membrane usually remains continuous
with the endoplasmic reticulum and also
bears ribosomes on it. At a number of

places the nuclear envelope is interrupted by minute pores, which are
formed by the fusion of its two membranes. These nuclear pores are the
passages through which movement of RNA and protein molecules takes
place in both directions between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Normally,
there is only one nucleus per cell, variations in the number of nuclei are
also frequently observed. Can you recollect names of organisms that
have more than one nucleus per cell? Some mature cells even lack
nucleus, e.g., erythrocytes of many mammals and sieve tube cells of
vascular plants. Would you consider these cells as ‘living’?

The nuclear matrix or the nucleoplasm contains nucleolus and
chromatin. The nucleoli are spherical structures present in the
nucleoplasm. The content of nucleolus is continuous with the rest of the
nucleoplasm as it is not a membrane bound structure. It is a site for
active ribosomal RNA synthesis. Larger and more numerous nucleoli are
present in cells actively carrying out protein synthesis.

CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 101

You may recall that the interphase nucleus has a loose
and indistinct network of nucleoprotein fibres called
chromatin. But during different stages of cell division, cells
show structured chromosomes in place of the nucleus.
Chromatin contains DNA and some basic proteins called
histones, some non-histone proteins and also RNA. A
single human cell has approximately two metre long
thread of DNA distributed among its forty six (twenty three
pairs) chromosomes. You will study the details of DNA
packaging in the form of a chromosome in class XII. Kinetochore

Every chromosome (visible only in dividing cells)
essentially has a primary constriction or the centromere
on the sides of which disc shaped structures called
kinetochores are present (Figure 8.12). Centromere holds
two chromatids of a chromosome. Based on the position
of the centromere, the chromosomes can be classified into
four types (Figure 8.13). The metacentric chromosome
has middle centromere forming two equal arms of the
chromosome. The sub-metacentric chromosome has
centromere slightly away from the middle of the Figure 8.12 Chromosome with
chromosome resulting into one shorter arm and one kinetochore
longer arm. In case of acrocentric chromosome the
centromere is situated close to its end forming one
extremely short and one very long arm, whereas the
telocentric chromosome has a terminal centromere.

102 BIOLOGY

Sometimes a few chromosomes have non-staining secondary
constrictions at a constant location. This gives the appearance of a small
fragment called the satellite.

8.5.11 Microbodies

Many membrane bound minute vesicles called microbodies that contain
various enzymes, are present in both plant and animal cells.

SUMMARY

All organisms are made of cells or aggregates of cells. Cells vary in their shape, size
and activities/functions. Based on the presence or absence of a membrane bound
nucleus and other organelles, cells and hence organisms can be named as
eukaryotic or prokaryotic.

A typical eukaryotic cell consists of a cell membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm.
Plant cells have a cell wall outside the cell membrane. The plasma membrane is
selectively permeable and facilitates transport of several molecules. The
endomembrane system includes ER, golgi complex, lysosomes and vacuoles. All
the cell organelles perform different but specific functions. Centrosome and centriole
form the basal body of cilia and flagella that facilitate locomotion. In animal cells,
centrioles also form spindle apparatus during cell division. Nucleus contains
nucleoli and chromatin network. It not only controls the activities of organelles
but also plays a major role in heredity.

Endoplasmic reticulum contains tubules or cisternae. They are of two types:
rough and smooth. ER helps in the transport of substances, synthesis of
proteins, lipoproteins and glycogen. The golgi body is a membranous organelle
composed of flattened sacs. The secretions of cells are packed in them and
transported from the cell. Lysosomes are single membrane structures
containing enzymes for digestion of all types of macromolecules. Ribosomes
are involved in protein synthesis. These occur freely in the cytoplasm or are
associated with ER. Mitochondria help in oxidative phosphorylation and
generation of adenosine triphosphate. They are bound by double membrane;
the outer membrane is smooth and inner one folds into several cristae. Plastids
are pigment containing organelles found in plant cells only. In plant cells,
chloroplasts are responsible for trapping light energy essential for
photosynthesis. The grana, in the plastid, is the site of light reactions and the
stroma of dark reactions. The green coloured plastids are chloroplasts, which
contain chlorophyll, whereas the other coloured plastids are chromoplasts,
which may contain pigments like carotene and xanthophyll. The nucleus is
enclosed by nuclear envelope, a double membrane structure with nuclear pores.
The inner membrane encloses the nucleoplasm and the chromatin material.
Thus, cell is the structural and functional unit of life.

while analysis for compounds gives an idea of
the kind of organic (Figure 9.1) and inorganic constituents (Table 9.2)
present in living tissues. From a chemistry point of view, one can identify
functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, aromatic compounds, etc. But
from a biological point of view, we shall classify them into amino acids,
nucleotide bases, fatty acids etc.

Amino acids are organic compounds containing an amino group and
an acidic group as substituents on the same carbon i.e., the α-carbon.
Hence, they are called α-amino acids. They are substituted methanes. There
are four substituent groups occupying the four valency positions. These
are hydrogen, carboxyl group, amino group and a variable group
designated as R group. Based on the nature of R group there are many
amino acids. However, those which occur in proteins are only of twenty

Reprint 2025-26



106 BIOLOGY

types. The R group in these proteinaceous amino acids could be a hydrogen
(the amino acid is called glycine), a methyl group (alanine), hydroxy methyl
(serine), etc. Three of the twenty are shown in Figure 9.1.

The chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially
of the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. Based on number of
amino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic
(lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. Similarly, there are aromatic
amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan). A particular property
of amino acids is the ionizable nature of –NH  and –COOH groups. Hence

2

in solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes.

B is called zwitterionic form.

Lipids are generally water insoluble. They could be simple fatty acids.
A fatty acid has a carboxyl group attached to an R group. The R group
could be a methyl (–CH ), or ethyl  (–C H ) or higher number of –CH

3 2 5 2

groups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). For example, palmitic acid has 16
carbons including carboxyl carbon. Arachidonic acid has 20 carbon
atoms including the carboxyl carbon. Fatty acids could be saturated
(without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double
bonds). Another simple lipid is glycerol which is trihydroxy propane. Many
lipids have both glycerol and fatty acids. Here the fatty acids are found
esterified with glycerol. They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides
and triglycerides. These are also called fats and oils based on melting
point. Oils have lower melting point (e.g., gingelly oil) and hence remain
as oil in winters. Can you identify a fat from the market? Some lipids
have phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them.
These are phospholipids. They are found in cell membrane. Lecithin is
one example. Some tissues especially the neural tissues have lipids with
more complex structures.

Living organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which
heterocyclic rings can be found. Some of these are nitrogen bases –
adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. When found attached to
a sugar, they are called nucleosides. If a phosphate group is also found
esterified to the sugar they are called nucleotides. Adenosine, guanosine,
thymidine, uridine and  cytidine are nucleosides. Adenylic acid, thymidylic
acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. Nucleic
acids like DNA and RNA consist of nucleotides only. DNA and RNA function
as genetic material.

9.2 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY METABOLITES

The most exciting aspect of chemistry deals with isolating thousands of
compounds, small and big, from living organisms, determining their
structure and if possible synthesising them.

If one were to make a list of biomolecules, such a list would have
thousands of organic compounds including amino acids, sugars, etc.
For reasons that are given in section 9.10, we can call these biomolecules
as ‘metabolites’. In animal tissues, one notices the presence of all such
categories of compounds shown in Figure 9.1. These are primary
metabolites. However, when one analyses plant, fungal and microbial cells,
one would see thousands of compounds other than these primary
metabolites, e.g. alkaloids, flavonoids, rubber, essential oils, antibiotics,

coloured pigments, scents, gums, spices. These

9.3 BIOMACROMOLECULES

There is one feature common to all those compounds found in the acid
soluble pool. They have molecular weights ranging from 18 to around
800 daltons (Da) approximately.

The acid insoluble fraction, has only four types of organic compounds
i.e., proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides and lipids. These classes of
compounds with the exception of lipids, have molecular weights in the
range of ten thousand daltons and above. For this very reason,
biomolecules, i.e., chemical compounds found in living organisms are of
two types. One, those which have molecular weights less than one
thousand dalton and are usually referred to as micromolecules or simply
biomolecules while those which are found in the acid insoluble fraction
are called macromolecules or biomacromolecules.

The molecules in the insoluble fraction with the exception of lipids
are polymeric substances. Then why do lipids, whose molecular weights
do not exceed 800 Da, come under acid insoluble fraction, i.e.,
macromolecular fraction? Lipids are indeed small molecular weight

compounds and are present not only as such but also
arranged into structures like cell membrane and other
membranes. When we grind a tissue, we are disrupting
the cell structure. Cell membrane and other
membranes are broken into pieces, and form vesicles
which are not water soluble. Therefore, these
membrane fragments in the form of vesicles get
separated along with the acid insoluble pool and hence
in the macromolecular fraction. Lipids are not strictly
macromolecules.

The acid soluble pool represents roughly the
cytoplasmic composition. The macromolecules from TABLE 9.4  Average Composition of Cells

fraction. Together they represent the entire chemical

Proteins are polypeptides. They are linear chains of
amino acids linked by peptide bonds as shown in

Each protein is a polymer of amino acids. As there
are 20 types of amino acids (e.g., alanine, cysteine,
proline, tryptophan, lysine, etc.), a protein is a
heteropolymer and not a homopolymer. A TABLE 9.5 Some Proteins and their

and Ribulose bisphosphate Carboxylase-Oxygenase (RuBisCO) is the
most abundant protein in the whole of the biosphere.

9.5 POLYSACCHARIDES

The acid insoluble pellet also has polysaccharides (carbohydrates) as
another class of macromolecules. Polysaccharides are long chains of
sugars. They are threads (literally a cotton thread) containing different
monosaccharides as building blocks. For example, cellulose is a
polymeric polysaccharide consisting of only one type of monosaccharide
i.e., glucose. Cellulose is a homopolymer. Starch is a variant of this but
present as a store house of energy in plant tissues. Animals have another
variant called glycogen. Inulin is a polymer of fructose. In a
polysaccharide chain (say glycogen), the right end is called the reducing
end and the left end is called the non-reducing end. It has branches as
shown in the form of a cartoon (Figure 9.2). Starch forms helical
secondary structures. In fact, starch can hold I  molecules in the helical

portion. The starch-I  is blue in colour. Cellulose does not contain

BIOMOLECULES 111

Plant cell walls are made of cellulose. Paper made from plant pulp
and cotton fibre is cellulosic. There are more complex polysaccharides
in nature. They have as building blocks, amino-sugars and chemically
modified sugars (e.g., glucosamine, N-acetyl galactosamine, etc.).
Exoskeletons of arthropods, for example, have a complex
polysaccharide called chitin. These complex polysaccharides are mostly
homopolymers.

9.6 NUCLEIC ACIDS

The other type of macromolecule that one would find in the acid
insoluble fraction of any living tissue is the nucleic acid. These are
polynucleotides. Together with polysaccharides and polypeptides these
comprise the true macromolecular fraction of any living tissue or cell.
For nucleic acids, the building block is a nucleotide. A nucleotide has
three chemically distinct components. One is a heterocyclic compound,
the second is a monosaccharide and the third a phosphoric acid or
phosphate.

As you notice in Figure 9.1, the heterocyclic compounds in nucleic
acids are the nitrogenous bases named adenine, guanine, uracil,
cytosine, and thymine. Adenine and Guanine are substituted purines
while the rest are substituted pyrimidines. The skeletal heterocyclic ring
is called as purine and pyrimidine respectively. The sugar found in
polynucleotides is either ribose (a monosaccharide pentose) or 2’
deoxyribose. A nucleic acid containing deoxyribose is called
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) while that which contains ribose is called
ribonucleic acid (RNA).

9.7 STRUCTURE OF PROTEINS

Proteins, as mentioned earlier, are heteropolymers containing strings
of amino acids. Structure of molecules means different things in
different contexts. In inorganic chemistry, the structure invariably
refers to the molecular formulae (e.g., NaCl, MgCl , etc.). Organic

2

chemists always write a two dimensional view of the molecules while
representing the structure of the molecules (e.g., benzene,
naphthalene, etc.). Physicists conjure up the three dimensional views
of molecular structures while biologists describe the protein structure
at four levels. The sequence of amino acids i.e., the positional
information in a protein – which is the first amino acid, which is
second, and so on – is called the primary structure (Figure 9.3 a) of
a protein. A protein is imagined as a line, the left end represented by
the first amino acid and the right end represented by the last amino

Figure 9.3 Various levels of Protein Structure

Some proteins are an assembly of more than one polypeptide
or subunits. The manner in which these individual folded
polypeptides or subunits are arranged with respect to each other
(e.g. linear string of spheres, spheres arranged one upon each
other in the form of a cube or plate etc.) is the architecture of a
protein otherwise called the quaternary structure of a protein
(Fig. 9.3 d). Adult human haemoglobin consists of 4 subunits.
Two of these are identical to each other. Hence, two subunits of α
type and two subunits of β type together constitute the human
haemoglobin (Hb).

9.8 ENZYMES

Almost all enzymes are proteins. There are some nucleic acids that behave
like enzymes. These are called ribozymes. One can depict an enzyme by a
line diagram. An enzyme like any protein has a primary structure, i.e.,
amino acid sequence of the protein. An enzyme like any protein has the
secondary and the tertiary structure. When you look at a tertiary structure

upon itself, the chain criss-crosses itself and hence, many crevices or
pockets are made. One such pocket is the ‘active site’. An active site of an
enzyme is a crevice or pocket into which the substrate fits. Thus enzymes,
through their active site, catalyse reactions at a high rate. Enzyme catalysts
differ from inorganic catalysts in many ways, but one major difference
needs mention. Inorganic catalysts work efficiently at high temperatures
and high pressures, while enzymes get damaged at high temperatures
(say above 40°C). However, enzymes isolated from organisms who normally
live under extremely high temperatures (e.g., hot vents and sulphur
springs), are stable and retain their catalytic power even at high
temperatures (upto 80°-90°C). Thermal stability is thus an important
quality of such enzymes isolated from thermophilic organisms.

9.8.1 Chemical Reactions

How do we understand these enzymes? Let us first understand a chemical
reaction. Chemical compounds undergo two types of changes. A physical
change simply refers to a change in shape without breaking of bonds.
This is a physical process. Another physical process is a change in state
of matter: when ice melts into water, or when water becomes a vapour.
These are also physical processes. However, when bonds are broken and
new bonds are formed during transformation, this will be called a chemical
reaction. For example:

Ba(OH) →
2 + H2SO4  BaSO4 + 2H2O

is an inorganic chemical reaction. Similarly, hydrolysis of starch into
glucose is an organic chemical reaction. Rate of a physical or chemical
process refers to the amount of product formed per unit time. It can be
expressed as:

δ P
rate = 

δ t

Rate can also be called velocity if the direction is specified. Rates of physical
and chemical processes are influenced by temperature among other
factors. A general rule of thumb is that rate doubles or decreases by half
for every 10°C change in either direction. Catalysed reactions proceed at
rates vastly higher than that of uncatalysed ones. When enzyme catalysed
reactions are observed, the rate would be vastly higher than the same
but uncatalysed reaction. For example

In the absence of any enzyme this reaction is very slow, with about
200 molecules of H CO  being formed in an hour. However, by using

the reaction speeds dramatically with about 600,000 molecules being
formed every second. The enzyme has accelerated the reaction rate by
about 10 million times. The power of enzymes is incredible indeed!

There are thousands of types of enzymes each catalysing a unique
chemical or metabolic reaction. A multistep chemical reaction, when
each of the steps is catalysed by the same enzyme complex or different
enzymes, is called a metabolic pathway. For example,

Glucose → 2 Pyruvic acid

C H O   +  O →  2C H  O + 2H O
6 12 6 2 3 4 3 2

is actually a metabolic pathway in which glucose becomes pyruvic acid
through ten different enzyme catalysed metabolic reactions. When you
study respiration in Chapter 12, you will study these reactions.  At this
stage you should know that this very metabolic pathway with one or two
additional reactions gives rise to a variety of metabolic end products. In
our skeletal muscle, under anaerobic conditions, lactic acid is formed.
Under normal aerobic conditions, pyruvic acid is formed. In yeast,  during
fermentation, the same pathway leads to the production of ethanol
(alcohol). Hence, in different conditions different products are possible.

9.8.2 How do Enzymes bring about such High Rates of
Chemical Conversions?

To understand this we should study enzymes a little more. We have already
understood the idea of an ‘active site’. The chemical or metabolic conversion
refers to a reaction. The chemical which is converted into a product is
called a ‘substrate’. Hence enzymes, i.e. proteins with three dimensional
structures including an ‘active site’, convert a substrate (S) into a product
(P). Symbolically, this can be depicted as:

S → P

It is now understood that the substrate ‘S’ has to bind the enzyme at
its ‘active site’ within a given cleft or pocket. The substrate has to diffuse
towards the ‘active site’. There is thus, an obligatory formation of an ‘ES’
complex. E stands for enzyme. This complex formation is a transient
phenomenon. During the state where substrate is bound to the enzyme
active site, a new structure of the substrate called transition state structure
is formed. Very soon, after the expected bond breaking/making is
completed, the product is released from the active site. In other words,
the structure of substrate gets transformed into the structure of product(s).
The pathway of this transformation must go through the so-called

transition state structure. There could be many Transition state

substrate and the product. Implicit in this Activation energy

S and P. If ‘P’ is at a lower level than ‘S’, the reaction Progress of reaction
is an exothermic reaction. One need not supply

energy (by heating) in order to form the product.
However, whether it is an exothermic or spontaneous reaction or an
endothermic or energy requiring reaction, the ‘S’ has to go through a much
higher energy state or transition state. The difference in average energy content
of ‘S’ from that of this transition state is called ‘activation energy’.

Enzymes eventually bring down this energy barrier making the
transition of ‘S’ to ‘P’ more easy.

9.8.3 Nature of Enzyme Action

Each enzyme (E) has a substrate (S) binding site in its molecule so that a
highly reactive enzyme-substrate complex (ES) is produced. This
complex is short-lived and dissociates into its product(s) P and the
unchanged enzyme with an intermediate formation of the enzyme-product
complex (EP).

The formation of the ES complex is essential for catalysis.

E + S          ES  →  EP →   E + P

The catalytic cycle of an enzyme action can be described in the following
steps:

1. First, the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, fitting
into the active site.

2. The binding of the substrate induces the enzyme to alter its shape,
fitting more tightly around the substrate.

3. The active site of the enzyme, now in close proximity of the
substrate breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate and the
new enzyme- product complex is formed.

4. The enzyme releases the products of the reaction and the free
enzyme is ready to bind to another molecule of the substrate and
run through the catalytic cycle once again.

9.8.4 Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity

The activity of an enzyme can be affected by a change in the conditions
which can alter the tertiary structure of the protein. These include
temperature, pH, change in substrate concentration or binding of specific
chemicals that regulate its activity.

Temperature and pH

Enzymes generally function in a narrow range of temperature and pH
(Figure 9.5). Each enzyme shows its highest activity at a particular
temperature and pH called the optimum temperature and optimum pH.
Activity declines both below and above the optimum value. Low
temperature preserves the enzyme in a temporarily inactive state whereas
high temperature destroys enzymatic activity because proteins are
denatured by heat.

Concentration of Substrate

With the increase in substrate concentration, the velocity of the enzymatic
reaction rises at first. The reaction ultimately reaches a maximum velocity
(Vmax) which is not exceeded by any further rise in concentration of the
substrate. This is because the enzyme molecules are fewer than the
substrate molecules and after saturation of these molecules, there are no
free enzyme molecules to bind with the additional substrate molecules
(Figure 9.5).

The activity of an enzyme is also sensitive to the presence of specific
chemicals that bind to the enzyme. When the binding of the chemical

shuts off enzyme activity, the process is called inhibition and the chemical
is called an inhibitor.

When the inhibitor closely resembles the substrate in its molecular
structure and inhibits the activity of the enzyme, it is known as
competitive inhibitor. Due to its close structural similarity with the
substrate, the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the substrate-
binding site of the enzyme. Consequently, the substrate cannot bind and
as a result, the enzyme action declines, e.g., inhibition of succinic
dehydrogenase by malonate which closely resembles the substrate
succinate in structure. Such competitive inhibitors are often used in the
control of bacterial pathogens.

9.8.5 Classification and Nomenclature of Enzymes

Thousands of enzymes have been discovered, isolated and studied. Most
of these enzymes have been classified into different groups based on the
type of reactions they catalyse. Enzymes are divided into 6 classes each
with 4-13 subclasses and named accordingly by a four-digit number.

Oxidoreductases/dehydrogenases: Enzymes which catalyse
oxidoreduction between two substrates S and S’ e.g.,

S reduced + S’ oxidised →  S oxidised + S’ reduced.

Transferases: Enzymes catalysing a transfer of a group, G (other than
hydrogen) between a pair of substrate S and S’ e.g.,

S - G + S’  →  S + S’ - G

Hydrolases: Enzymes catalysing hydrolysis of ester, ether, peptide,
glycosidic, C-C, C-halide or P-N bonds.

Lyases: Enzymes that catalyse removal of groups from substrates by
mechanisms other than hydrolysis leaving double bonds.

Isomerases: Includes all enzymes catalysing inter-conversion of optical,
geometric or positional isomers.

Ligases: Enzymes catalysing the linking together of 2 compounds, e.g.,
enzymes which catalyse joining of C-O, C-S, C-N,  P-O etc. bonds.

9.8.6 Co-factors

Enzymes are composed of one or several polypeptide chains. However,
there are a number of cases in which non-protein constituents called co-
factors are bound to the the enzyme to make the enzyme catalytically

Reprint 2025-26



118 BIOLOGY

active. In these instances, the protein portion of the enzymes is called the
apoenzyme. Three kinds of cofactors may be identified: prosthetic groups,
co-enzymes and metal ions.

Prosthetic groups are organic compounds and are distinguished from
other cofactors in that they are tightly bound to the apoenzyme. For
example, in peroxidase and catalase, which catalyze the breakdown of
hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, haem is the prosthetic group
and it is a part of the active site of the enzyme.

Co-enzymes are also organic compounds but their association with
the apoenzyme is only transient, usually occurring during the course of
catalysis. Furthermore, co-enzymes serve as co-factors in a number of
different enzyme catalyzed reactions. The essential chemical components
of many coenzymes are vitamins, e.g., coenzyme nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD) and NADP contain the vitamin niacin.

A number of enzymes require metal ions for their activity which form
coordination bonds with side chains at the active site and at the same
time form one or more cordination bonds with the substrate, e.g., zinc is
a cofactor for the proteolytic enzyme carboxypeptidase.

Catalytic  activity is lost when the co-factor is removed from the enzyme
which testifies that they play a crucial role in the catalytic activity of the
enzyme.

SUMMARY

Although there is a bewildering diversity of living organisms, their chemical
composition and metabolic reactions appear to be remarkably similar. The
elemental composition of living tissues and non-living matter appear also to be
similar when analysed qualitatively. However, a closer examination reveals that
the relative abundance of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen is higher in living systems
when compared to inanimate matter. The most abundant chemical in living
organisms is water. There are thousands of small molecular weight (<1000 Da)
biomolecules. Amino acids, monosaccharide and disaccharide sugars, fatty acids,
glycerol, nucleotides, nucleosides and nitrogen bases are some of the organic
compounds seen in living organisms. There are 20 types of amino acids and 5
types of nucleotides. Fats and oils are glycerides in which fatty acids are esterified
to glycerol. Phospholipids contain, in addition, a phosphorylated nitrogenous
compound.

Only three types of macromolecules, i.e., proteins, nucleic acids and
polysaccharides are found in living systems. Lipids, because of their association
with membranes separate in the macromolecular fraction. Biomacromolecules
are polymers. They are made of building blocks which are different. Proteins
are heteropolymers made of amino acids. Nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) are
composed of nucleotides. Biomacromolecules have a hierarchy of structures –

Reprint 2025-26



BIOMOLECULES 119

primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. Nucleic acids serve as genetic
material. Polysaccharides are components of cell wall in plants, fungi and also
of the exoskeleton of arthropods. They also are storage forms of energy (e.g.,
starch and glycogen). Proteins serve a variety of cellular functions. Many of
them are enzymes, some are antibodies, some are receptors, some are hormones
and some others are structural proteins. Collagen is the most abundant protein
in animal world and Ribulose bisphosphate Carboxylase-Oxygenase (RuBisCO)
is the most abundant protein in the whole of the biosphere.

Enzymes are proteins which catalyse biochemical reactions in the cells.
Ribozymes are nucleic acids with catalytic power. Proteinaceous enzymes exhibit
substrate specificity, require optimum temperature and pH for maximal activity.
They are denatured at high temperatures. Enzymes lower activation energy of
reactions and enhance greatly the rate of the reactions. Nucleic acids carry
hereditary information and are passed on from parental generation to progeny.

10.1 CELL CYCLE

Cell division is a very important  process in all living organisms. During
the division of a cell, DNA replication and cell growth also take place. All
these processes, i.e., cell division, DNA replication, and cell growth, hence,
have to take place in a coordinated way to ensure correct division and
formation of progeny cells containing intact genomes. The sequence of
events by which a cell duplicates its genome, synthesises the other
constituents of the cell and eventually divides into two daughter cells is
termed cell cycle. Although cell growth (in terms of cytoplasmic increase)
is a continuous process, DNA synthesis occurs only during one specific
stage in the cell cycle. The replicated chromosomes (DNA) are then
distributed to daughter nuclei by a complex series of events during cell
division. These events are themselves under genetic control.

CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION 121

10.1.1 Phases of Cell Cycle

A typical eukaryotic cell cycle is illustrated by
human cells in culture. These cells divide once
in approximately every 24 hours (Figure 10.1).
However, this duration of cell cycle can vary from
organism to organism and also from cell type
to cell type. Yeast for example, can progress
through the cell cycle in only about 90 minutes.

The cell cycle is divided into two basic
phases:

l Interphase

l M Phase (Mitosis phase)

The M Phase represents the phase when the
actual cell division or mitosis occurs and the
interphase represents the phase between two
successive M phases. It is significant to note that Figure 10.1 A diagrammatic view of cell cycle

about an hour. The interphase lasts more than
95% of the duration of cell cycle.

The M Phase starts with the nuclear division, corresponding to the
separation of daughter chromosomes (karyokinesis) and usually ends
with division of cytoplasm (cytokinesis). The interphase, though  called
the resting phase,  is the time during which the cell is preparing for division
by undergoing both cell growth and DNA replication in an orderly manner.
The interphase is divided into three further phases:

This is the most dramatic period of the cell cycle, involving a major
reorganisation of virtually all components of the cell. Since the number of
chromosomes in the parent and progeny cells is the same, it is also called as
equational division. Though for convenience mitosis has been divided
into four stages of nuclear division (karyokinesis), it is very essential to
understand that cell division is a progressive process and very clear-cut
lines cannot be drawn between various stages. Karyokinesis involves
following four stages:

l Prophase

l Metaphase

l Anaphase

l Telophase

10.2.1 Prophase

Prophase which is the first stage of karyokinesis of mitosis follows the
S and G  phases of interphase. In the S and G  phases, the new DNA

2 2
molecules formed are not distinct but intertwined. Prophase is marked
by the initiation of condensation of chromosomal material. The
chromosomal material becomes untangled during the process of
chromatin condensation (Figure 10.2 a). The centrosome, which had
undergone duplication during S phase of interphase, now begins to move
towards opposite poles of the cell. The completion of prophase can thus
be marked by the following characteristic events:

l Chromosomal material condenses to form compact mitotic
chromosomes. Chromosomes are seen to be composed of two
chromatids attached together at the centromere.

l Centrosome which had undergone duplication during interphase,
begins to move towards opposite poles of the cell. Each centrosome
radiates out microtubules called asters. The two asters together
with spindle fibres forms mitotic apparatus.

Reprint 2025-26



CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION 123

Cells at the end of prophase, when viewed under the
microscope, do not show golgi complexes, endoplasmic
reticulum, nucleolus and the nuclear envelope.

10.2.2 Metaphase

The complete disintegration of the nuclear envelope marks
the start of the second phase of mitosis, hence the
chromosomes are spread through the cytoplasm of the cell.
By this stage, condensation of chromosomes is completed
and they can be observed clearly under the microscope. This
then, is the stage at which morphology of chromosomes is
most easily studied. At this stage, metaphase chromosome
is made up of two sister chromatids, which are held together
by the centromere (Figure 10.2 b). Small disc-shaped
structures at the surface of the centromeres are called
kinetochores. These structures serve as the sites of
attachment of spindle fibres to the chromosomes that are
moved into position at the centre of the cell. Hence, the
metaphase is characterised by all the chromosomes coming
to lie at the equator with one chromatid of each chromosome
connected by its kinetochore to spindle fibres from one
pole and its sister chromatid connected by its kinetochore
to spindle fibres from the opposite pole (Figure 10.2 b).
The plane of alignment of the chromosomes at metaphase
is referred to as the metaphase plate.  The key features
of metaphase are:

l Spindle fibres attach to kinetochores of
chromosomes.

l Chromosomes are moved to spindle equator and get
aligned along metaphase plate through spindle fibres
to both poles.

10.2.3 Anaphase

At the onset of anaphase, each chromosome arranged at the
metaphase plate is split simultaneously and the two daughter
chromatids, now referred to as daughter  chromosomes of
the future daughter nuclei, begin their migration towards
the two opposite poles. As each chromosome moves away
from the equatorial plate, the centromere of each chromosome
remains directed towards the pole and hence at the leading
edge, with the arms of the chromosome trailing behind

(Figure 10.2 c). Thus, anaphase stage is characterised by view of stages in mitosis

124 BIOLOGY

the following key events:

l Centromeres split and chromatids separate.

l Chromatids move to opposite poles.

10.2.4 Telophase

At the beginning of the final stage of karyokinesis, i.e.,
telophase, the chromosomes that have reached their
respective poles decondense and lose their individuality. The
individual chromosomes can no longer be seen and each set
of chromatin material tends to collect at each of the two poles
(Figure 10.2 d). This is the stage which shows the following
key events:

l Chromosomes cluster at opposite spindle poles and their
identity is lost as discrete elements.

l Nuclear envelope develops around the chromosome
clusters at each pole forming two daughter nuclei.

l Nucleolus, golgi complex and ER reform.

10.2.5 Cytokinesis

Mitosis accomplishes not only the segregation of duplicated
chromosomes into daughter nuclei (karyokinesis), but the
cell itself is divided into two daughter cells by the separation
of cytoplasm called cytokinesis at the end of which cell
division gets completed (Figure 10.2 e). In an animal cell,
this is achieved by the appearance of a furrow in the plasma
membrane. The furrow gradually deepens and ultimately
joins in the centre dividing the cell cytoplasm into two. Plant
cells however, are enclosed by a relatively inextensible cell
wall, thererfore they undergo cytokinesis by a different
mechanism. In plant cells, wall formation starts in the centre
of the cell and grows outward to meet the existing lateral
walls. The formation of the new cell wall begins with the
formation of a simple precursor, called the cell-plate that
represents the middle lamella between the walls of two
adjacent cells. At the time of cytoplasmic division, organelles
like mitochondria and plastids get distributed between the
two daughter cells. In some organisms karyokinesis is not
followed by cytokinesis as a result of which multinucleate

CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION 125

10.3 Significance of Mitosis

Mitosis or the equational division is usually restricted to the diploid cells
only. However, in some lower plants and in some social insects haploid
cells also divide by mitosis. It is very essential to understand the
significance of this division in the life of an organism. Are you aware of
some examples where you have studied about haploid and diploid insects?

Mitosis usually results in the production of diploid daughter cells
with identical genetic complement. The growth of multicellular organisms
is due to mitosis. Cell growth results in disturbing the ratio between the
nucleus and the cytoplasm. It therefore becomes essential for the cell to
divide to restore the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. A very significant
contribution of mitosis is cell repair. The cells of the upper layer of the
epidermis, cells of the lining of the gut, and blood cells are being constantly
replaced. Mitotic divisions in the meristematic tissues – the apical and
the lateral cambium, result in a continuous growth of plants throughout
their life.

10.4 MEIOSIS

The production of offspring by sexual reproduction includes the fusion
of two gametes, each with a complete haploid set of chromosomes. Gametes
are formed from specialised diploid cells. This specialised kind of cell
division that reduces the chromosome number by half results in the
production of haploid daughter cells. This kind of division is called
meiosis. Meiosis ensures the production of haploid phase in the life cycle
of sexually reproducing organisms whereas fertilisation restores the diploid
phase. We come across meiosis during gametogenesis in plants and
animals. This leads to the formation of haploid gametes. The key features
of meiosis are as follows:

l Meiosis involves two sequential cycles of nuclear and cell division called
meiosis I and meiosis II but only a single cycle of DNA replication.

l Meiosis I is initiated after the parental chromosomes have replicated
to produce identical sister chromatids at the S phase.

l Meiosis involves pairing of homologous chromosomes and
recombination between non-sister chromatids of homologous
chromosomes.

l Four haploid cells are formed at the end of meiosis II.

Meiotic events can be grouped under the following phases:

Meiosis I Meiosis II

Prophase I Prophase II

Metaphase I Metaphase II

Anaphase I Anaphase II

Telophase I Telophase II

Reprint 2025-26



126 BIOLOGY

10.4.1 Meiosis I

Prophase I: Prophase of the first meiotic division is typically longer and
more complex when compared to prophase of mitosis. It has been further
subdivided into the following five phases based on chromosomal
behaviour, i.e., Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene and Diakinesis.

During leptotene stage the chromosomes become gradually visible
under the light microscope. The compaction of chromosomes continues
throughout leptotene. This is followed by the second stage of prophase
I called zygotene. During this stage, chromosomes start pairing
together and this process of association is called synapsis. Such paired
chromosomes are called homologous chromosomes. Electron
micrographs of this stage, indicate that chromosome synapsis is
accompanied by the formation of complex structure called
synaptonemal complex. The complex formed by a pair of synapsed
homologous chromosomes is called a bivalent or a tetrad. However,
these are more clearly visible at the next stage. The first two stages of
prophase I are relatively short-lived compared to the next stage that is
pachytene. During this stage, the four chromatids of each bivalent
chromosomes becomes distinct and clearly appear as tetrads. This
stage is characterised by the appearance of recombination nodules,
the sites at which crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids
of the homologous chromosomes. Crossing over is the exchange of
genetic material between two homologous chromosomes. Crossing over
is also an enzyme-mediated process and the enzyme involved is called
recombinase. Crossing over leads to recombination of genetic material
on the two chromosomes. Recombination between homologous
chromosomes is completed by the end of pachytene, leaving the
chromosomes linked at the sites of crossing over.

The beginning of diplotene is recognised by the dissolution of the
synaptonemal complex and the tendency of the recombined
homologous chromosomes of the bivalents to separate from each other
except at the sites of crossovers. These X-shaped structures, are called
chiasmata. In oocytes of some vertebrates, diplotene can last for
months or years.

The final stage of meiotic prophase I is diakinesis. This is marked by
terminalisation of chiasmata. During this phase the chromosomes are
fully condensed and the meiotic spindle is assembled to prepare the
homologous chromosomes for separation. By the end of diakinesis, the
nucleolus disappears and the nuclear envelope also breaks down.
Diakinesis represents transition to metaphase.
Metaphase I: The bivalent chromosomes align on the equatorial plate
(Figure 10.3). The microtubules from the opposite poles of the spindle
attach to the kinetochore of homologous chromosomes.

Anaphase I: The homologous chromosomes separate, while sister
chromatids remain associated at their centromeres (Figure 10.3).

Telophase I: The nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear,
cytokinesis follows and this is called as dyad of cells (Figure 10.3).
Although in many cases the chromosomes do undergo some dispersion,
they do not reach the extremely extended state of the interphase nucleus.
The stage between the two meiotic divisions is called interkinesis and is
generally short lived.  There is no replication of DNA during interkinesis.
Interkinesis is followed by prophase II, a much simpler prophase than
prophase I.

10.4.2 Meiosis II

Prophase II: Meiosis II is initiated immediately after cytokinesis, usually
before the chromosomes have fully elongated.  In contrast to meiosis I,
meiosis II resembles a normal mitosis. The nuclear membrane disappears
by the end of prophase II (Figure 10.4). The chromosomes again become
compact.

Metaphase II: At this stage, the chromosomes align at the equator and
the microtubules from opposite poles of the spindle get attached to the
kinetochores (Figure 10.4) of sister chromatids.

Anaphase II: It begins with the simultaneous splitting of the centromere
of each chromosome  (which was holding the sister chromatids together),
allowing them to move toward opposite poles of the cell (Figure 10.4) by
shortening of microtubules attached to kinetochores.

Telophase II: Meiosis ends with telophase II, in which the two
groups of chromosomes once again get enclosed by a nuclear
envelope; cytokinesis follows resulting in the formation of tetrad
of cells i.e., four haploid daughter cells (Figure 10.4).

10.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF MEIOSIS

Meiosis is the mechanism by which conservation of specific
chromosome number of each species is achieved across
generations in sexually reproducing organisms, even though the
process, per se, paradoxically, results in reduction of chromosome
number by half. It also increases the genetic variability in the
population of organisms from one generation to the next. Variations
are very important for the process of evolution.

SUMMARY

According to the cell theory, cells arise from preexisting cells. The process by
which this occurs is called cell division. Any sexually reproducing organism
starts its life cycle from a single-celled zygote. Cell division does not stop with
the formation of the mature organism but continues throughout its life cycle.

CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION 129

The stages through which a cell passes from one division to the next is called
the cell cycle. Cell cycle is divided into two phases called (i) Interphase – a
period of preparation for cell division, and (ii) Mitosis (M phase) – the actual
period of cell division. Interphase is further subdivided into G , S and G . G

1 2 1

phase is the period when the cell grows and carries out normal metabolism.
Most of the organelle duplication also occurs during this phase. S phase marks
the phase of DNA replication and chromosome duplication. G  phase is the

2

period of cytoplasmic growth. Mitosis is also divided into four stages namely
prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Chromosome condensation
occurs during prophase. Simultaneously, the centrioles move to the opposite
poles. The nuclear envelope and the nucleolus disappear and the spindle
fibres start appearing. Metaphase is marked by the alignment of chromosomes
at the equatorial plate. During anaphase the centromeres divide and the
chromatids start moving towards the two opposite poles. Once the chromatids
reach the two poles, the chromosomal elongation starts, nucleolus and the
nuclear membrane reappear. This stage is called the telophase.  Nuclear
division is then followed by the cytoplasmic division and is called cytokinesis.
Mitosis thus, is the equational division in which the chromosome number of
the parent is conserved in the daughter cell.

In contrast to mitosis, meiosis occurs in the diploid cells, which are destined to
form gametes. It is called the reduction division since it reduces the chromosome
number by half while making the gametes. In sexual reproduction when the two
gametes fuse the chromosome number is restored to the value in the parent.
Meiosis is divided into two phases – meiosis I and meiosis II. In the first meiotic
division the homologous chromosomes pair to form bivalents, and undergo crossing
over. Meiosis I has a long prophase, which is divided further into five phases.
These are leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis. During
metaphase I the bivalents arrange on the equatorial plate. This is followed by
anaphase I in which homologous chromosomes move to the opposite poles with
both their chromatids. Each pole receives half the chromosome number of the
parent cell. In telophase I, the nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear. Meiosis
II is similar to mitosis. During anaphase II the sister chromatids separate. Thus at
the end of meiosis four haploid cells are formed.

MELVIN CALVIN born in Minnesota in April, 1911, received his
Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Minnesota. He served
as Professor of Chemistry at the University of California,
Berkeley.

Just after world war II, when the world was under shock
after the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings, and seeing the ill-
effects of radio-activity, Calvin and co-workers put radio-
activity to beneficial use. He along with J.A. Bassham studied
reactions in green plants forming sugar and other substances
from raw materials like carbon dioxide, water and minerals
by labelling the carbon dioxide with C14. Calvin proposed that
plants change light energy to chemical energy by transferring
an electron in an organised array of pigment molecules and
other substances. The mapping of the pathway of carbon
assimilation in photosynthesis earned him Nobel Prize in 1961.

The principles of photosynthesis as established by Calvin

11.2 EARLY EXPERIMENTS

It is interesting to learn about those simple
experiments that led to a gradual development in
our understanding of photosynthesis.

Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) in 1770
performed a series of experiments that revealed the
essential role of air in the growth of green plants.
Priestley, you may recall, discovered oxygen in
1774. Priestley observed that a candle burning in
a closed space – a bell jar, soon gets extinguished
(Figure 11.1 a, b, c, d).  Similarly, a mouse would

(c) (d)
soon suffocate in a closed space. He concluded that

Figure 11.1 Priestley’s experiment
a burning candle or an animal that breathe the air,

both somehow, damage the air.  But when he placed a mint plant in the
same bell jar, he found that the mouse stayed alive and the candle
continued to burn.  Priestley hypothesised as follows: Plants restore to
the air whatever breathing animals and burning candles remove.

Can you imagine how Priestley would have conducted the experiment
using a candle and a plant?  Remember, he would need to rekindle the
candle to test whether it burns after a few days. How many different
ways can you think of to light the candle without disturbing the set-up?

Using a similar setup as the one used by Priestley, but by placing it
once in the dark and once in the sunlight, Jan Ingenhousz (1730-1799)
showed that sunlight is essential for the plant process that somehow
purifies the air fouled by burning candles or breathing animals.
Ingenhousz in an elegant experiment with an aquatic plant showed that
in bright sunlight, small bubbles were formed around the green parts
while in the dark they did not.  Later he identified these bubbles to be of
oxygen.  Hence he showed that it is only the green part of the plants that
could release oxygen.

PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 135

It was not until about 1854 that Julius von Sachs provided evidence
for production of glucose when plants grow. Glucose is usually stored as
starch. His later studies showed that the green substance in plants
(chlorophyll as we know it now) is located in special bodies (later called
chloroplasts) within plant cells. He found that the green parts in plants is
where glucose is made, and that the glucose is usually stored as starch.

Now consider the interesting experiments done by T.W Engelmann
(1843 – 1909).  Using a prism he split light into its spectral components
and then illuminated a green alga, Cladophora, placed in a suspension
of aerobic bacteria. The bacteria were used to detect the sites of O

2

evolution. He observed that the bacteria accumulated mainly in the region
of blue and red light of the split spectrum. A first action spectrum of
photosynthesis was thus described. It resembles roughly the absorption
spectra of chlorophyll a and b (discussed  in section 11.4).

By the middle of the nineteenth century the key features of plant
photosynthesis were known, namely, that plants could use light energy
to make carbohydrates from CO  and water.  The empirical equation

2

representing the total process of photosynthesis for oxygen evolving
organisms was then understood as:

Light
CO2 + H2O →[CH2O]+ O2

where [CH O] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon
2

sugar).
A milestone contribution to the understanding of photosynthesis was

that made by a microbiologist, Cornelius van Niel (1897-1985), who,
based on his studies of purple and green bacteria, demonstrated that
photosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction in which
hydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide
to carbohydrates. This can be expressed by:

Light
2H2 A +CO2 →2A + CH2O + H2O

In green plants H O is the hydrogen donor and is oxidised to O . Some
2 2

organisms do not release O during photosynthesis.  When H S, instead
2 2

is the hydrogen donor for purple and green sulphur bacteria, the
‘oxidation’ product is sulphur or sulphate depending on the organism
and not O . Hence, he inferred that the O evolved by the green plant

2 2 

comes from H O, not from carbon dioxide. This was later proved by using
2

radioisotopic techniques.  The correct equation, that would represent  the
overall process of photosynthesis is therefore:

Light
6CO2 +12H2O →C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2

where C  H  O  represents glucose. The O  released is from water; this

Can you explain why twelve molecules of water as substrate are used
in the equation given above?

11.3 WHERE DOES PHOTOSYNTHESIS TAKE PLACE?

You would of course answer: in ‘the green leaf’ or ‘in the chloroplasts’,
based on what you earlier read in Chapter 8. You are definitely right.
Photosynthesis does take place in the green leaves of plants but it does so
also in other green parts of the plants. Can you name some other parts
where you think photosynthesis may occur?

You would recollect from previous unit that the mesophyll cells in the
leaves, have a large number of chloroplasts. Usually the chloroplasts align
themselves along the walls of the mesophyll cells, such that they get the
optimum quantity of the incident light. When do you think the
chloroplasts will be aligned with their flat surfaces parallel to the walls?
When would they be perpendicular to the incident light?

You have studied the structure of chloroplast in Chapter 8. Within
the chloroplast there is membranous system consisting of grana, the
stroma lamellae, and the matrix stroma (Figure 11.2). There is a clear
division of labour within the chloroplast. The membrane system is
responsible for trapping the light energy and also for the synthesis of ATP
and NADPH. In stroma, enzymatic reactions synthesise sugar, which in
turn forms starch. The former set of reactions, since they are directly light
driven are called light reactions (photochemical reactions). The latter
are not directly light driven but are dependent on the products of light
reactions (ATP and NADPH). Hence, to distinguish the latter they are called,
by convention, as dark reactions (carbon reactions). However, this should
not be construed to mean that they occur in darkness or that they are not
light-dependent.

11.4 HOW MANY TYPES OF PIGMENTS ARE

INVOLVED IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS?

Looking at plants have you ever wondered why
and how there are so many shades of green in
their leaves – even in the same plant? We can
look for an answer to this question by trying to
separate the leaf pigments of any green  plant
through paper chromatography. A
chromatographic separation of the leaf pigments
shows that the colour that we see in leaves is
not due to a single pigment but due to four
pigments: Chlorophyll a (bright or blue green
in the chromatogram), chlorophyll b (yellow
green), xanthophylls (yellow) and carotenoids
(yellow to yellow-orange).  Let us now see what
roles various pigments play in photosynthesis.

Pigments are substances that have an ability
to absorb light, at specific wavelengths. Can you
guess which is the most abundant plant
pigment in the world? Let us study the graph
showing the ability of chlorophyll a pigment to
absorb lights of different wavelengths (Figure
11.3 a). Of course, you are familiar with the
wavelength of the visible spectrum of light as
well as the VIBGYOR.

From Figure 11.3a can you determine the
wavelength (colour of light) at which chlorophyll
a shows the maximum absorption? Does it
show another absorption peak at any other
wavelengths too? If yes, which one?

Now look at Figure 11.3b showing the
wavelengths at which maximum photosynthesis
occurs in a plant. Can you see that the
wavelengths at which there is maximum
absorption by chlorophyll a, i.e., in the blue and
the red regions, also shows higher rate of

Figure 11.3a Graph showing the absorption
photosynthesis. Hence, we can conclude that spectrum of chlorophyll a, b and
chlorophyll a is the chief pigment associated the carotenoids
with photosynthesis. But by looking at Figure Figure 11.3b Graph showing action

Reprint 2025-26



138 BIOLOGY

These graphs, together, show that most of the photosynthesis takes
place in the blue and red regions of the spectrum; some photosynthesis
does take place at the other wavelengths of the visible spectrum.  Let us
see how this happens. Though chlorophyll is the major pigment
responsible for trapping light, other thylakoid pigments like chlorophyll
b, xanthophylls and carotenoids, which are called accessory pigments,
also absorb light and transfer the energy to chlorophyll a. Indeed, they
not only enable a wider range of wavelength of incoming light to be utilised
for photosyntesis but also protect chlorophyll a from photo-oxidation.

11.5 WHAT IS LIGHT REACTION?

Light reactions or the ‘Photochemical’ phase
include light absorption, water splitting, oxygen

Primary acceptor release, and the formation of high-energy
chemical intermediates, ATP and NADPH.
Several protein complexes are involved in the
process. The pigments are organised into two
discrete photochemical light harvesting

Photon Reaction complexes (LHC) within the Photosystem I (PS
centre I) and Photosystem II (PS II).  These are named

in the sequence of their discovery, and not in the
sequence in which they function during the light

Pigment reaction. The LHC are  made up of hundreds of
molecules

pigment molecules bound to proteins. Each
photosystem has all the pigments (except one
molecule of chlorophyll a) forming a light
harvesting system also called antennae (Figure

Figure 11.4 The light harvesting complex
11.4). These pigments help to make
photosynthesis more efficient by absorbing

different wavelengths of light. The single chlorophyll a molecule forms the
reaction centre. The reaction centre is different in both the photosystems.
In PS I the reaction centre chlorophyll a has an absorption peak at 700
nm, hence is called P700, while in PS II it has absorption maxima at 680
nm, and is called P680.

11.6 THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT

In photosystem II the reaction centre chlorophyll a absorbs 680 nm
wavelength of red light causing electrons to become excited and jump
into an orbit farther from the atomic nucleus. These electrons are picked
up by an electron acceptor which passes them to an electrons transport

These electrons then are moved downhill again, LHC

H+ is called the Z scheme, due to its characterstic shape (Figure 11.5).
This shape is formed when all the carriers are placed in a sequence on a
redox potential scale.

11.6.1 Splitting of Water

You would then ask, How does PS II supply electrons continuously? The
electrons that were moved from photosystem II must be replaced. This is
achieved by electrons available due to splitting of water. The splitting of
water is associated with the PS II; water is split into 2H+, [O] and electrons.
This creates oxygen, one of the net products of photosynthesis. The
electrons needed to replace those removed from photosystem I are provided
by photosystem II.

2H2O →4H+ −

We need to emphasise here that the water splitting complex is associated
with the PS II, which itself is physically located on the inner side of the
membrane of the thylakoid. Then, where are the protons and O formed

2 

likely to be released – in the lumen? or on the outer side of the membrane?

11.6.2 Cyclic and Non-cyclic Photo-phosphorylation

Living organisms have the capability of extracting energy from oxidisable
substances and store this in the form of bond energy. Special substances like
ATP, carry this energy in their chemical bonds. The process through which

Reprint 2025-26



140 BIOLOGY

ATP is synthesised by cells (in mitochondria and
Photosystem I chloroplasts) is named phosphorylation. Photo-

phosphorylation is the synthesis of ATP from

e- ADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of
acceptor

light. When the two photosystems work in a
Light series, first PS II and then the PS I, a process called

non-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs. The
two photosystems are connected through an

Electron
transport electron transport chain, as seen earlier – in the
system Z scheme. Both ATP and NADPH + H+  are

synthesised by this kind of electron flow (Figure
11.5).

Chlorophyll When only PS I is functional, the electron is
P 700 circulated within the photosystem and the

phosphorylation occurs due to cyclic flow of
Figure 11.6 Cyclic photophosphorylation electrons (Figure 11.6). A possible location

where this could be happening is in the stroma
lamellae.  While the membrane or lamellae of the grana have both PS I
and PS II the stroma lamellae membranes lack PS II as well as NADP
reductase enzyme. The excited electron does not pass on to NADP+ but is
cycled back to the PS I complex through the electron transport chain
(Figure 11.6).  The cyclic flow hence, results only in the synthesis of ATP,
but not of NADPH + H+. Cyclic photophosphorylation also occurs when
only light of wavelengths beyond 680 nm are available for excitation.

11.6.3 Chemiosmotic Hypothesis

Let us now try and understand how actually ATP is synthesised in the
chloroplast. The chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain
the mechanism. Like in respiration, in photosynthesis too, ATP synthesis is
linked to development of a proton gradient across a membrane. This time
these are the membranes of thylakoid. There is one difference though, here
the proton accumulation is towards the inside of the membrane, i.e., in the
lumen. In respiration, protons accumulate in the intermembrane space of
the mitochondria when electrons move through the ETS (Chapter 12).

Let us understand what causes the proton gradient across the
membrane. We need to consider again the processes that take place during
the activation of electrons and their transport to determine the steps that
cause a proton gradient to develop (Figure 11.7).

(a) Since splitting of the water molecule takes place on the inner side of
the membrane, the protons or hydrogen ions that are produced by
the splitting of water accumulate within the lumen of the thylakoids.

ADP+iP
ATP



PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 141

Figure 11.7 ATP synthesis through chemiosmosis

(b) As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported
across the membrane.  This happens because the primary accepter of
electron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane
transfers its electron not to an electron carrier but to an H carrier.
Hence, this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while
transporting an electron.  When this molecule passes on its electron
to the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton
is released into the inner side or the lumen side of the membrane.

(c) The NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the
membrane.  Along with electrons that come from the acceptor of
electrons of PS I, protons are necessary for the reduction of NADP+ to
NADPH+ H+.  These protons are also removed from the stroma.

Hence, within the chloroplast, protons in the stroma decrease in
number, while in the lumen there is accumulation of protons.  This creates
a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane as well as a measurable
decrease in pH in the lumen.

Why are we so interested in the proton gradient?  This gradient is
important because it is the breakdown of this gradient that leads to the
synthesis of ATP.  The gradient is broken down due to the movement of
protons across the membrane to the stroma through the transmembrane

channel of the CF  of the ATP synthase. The ATP synthase enzyme consists
0

of two parts: one called the CF  is embedded in the thylakoid membrane
0

and forms a transmembrane channel that carries out facilitated diffusion
of protons across the membrane. The other portion is called CF  and

1

protrudes on the outer surface of the thylakoid membrane on the side
that faces the stroma. The break down of the gradient provides enough
energy to cause a conformational change in the CF  particle of the ATP

1

synthase, which makes the enzyme synthesise several molecules of energy-
packed ATP.

Chemiosmosis requires a membrane, a proton pump, a proton
gradient and ATP synthase. Energy is used to pump protons across a
membrane, to create a gradient or a high concentration of protons within
the thylakoid lumen. ATP synthase has a channel that allows diffusion of
protons back across the membrane; this releases enough energy to activate
ATP synthase enzyme that catalyses the formation of ATP.

Along with the NADPH produced by the movement of electrons, the
ATP will be used immediately in the biosynthetic  reaction taking place in
the stroma, responsible for fixing CO , and synthesis of sugars.

2

11.7 WHERE ARE THE ATP AND NADPH USED?

We learnt that the products of light reaction are ATP, NADPH and O . Of
2

these O  diffuses out of the chloroplast while ATP and NADPH are used to
2

drive the processes leading to the synthesis of food, more accurately, sugars.
This is the biosynthetic phase of photosynthesis. This process does not
directly depend on the presence of light but is dependent on the products
of the light reaction, i.e., ATP and NADPH, besides CO and H O. You may

2 2

wonder how this could be verified; it is simple: immediately after light
becomes unavailable, the biosynthetic process continues for some time,
and then stops. If then, light is made available, the synthesis starts again.

Can we, hence, say that calling the biosynthetic phase as the dark
reaction is a misnomer? Discuss this amongst yourselves.

Let us now see how the ATP and NADPH are used in the biosynthetic
phase. We saw earlier that CO  is combined with H O to produce (CH O)

2 2 2 n

or sugars. It was of interest to scientists to find out how this reaction
proceeded, or rather what was the first product formed when CO  is taken

2

into a reaction or fixed. Just after world war II, among the several efforts
to put radioisotopes to beneficial use, the work of Melvin Calvin is
exemplary. The use of radioactive 14C by him in algal photosynthesis
studies led to the discovery that the first CO  fixation product was a

2

3-carbon organic acid. He also contributed to working out the complete
biosynthetic pathway; hence it was called Calvin cycle after him. The
first product identified was 3-phosphoglyceric acid or in short PGA.
How many carbon atoms does it have?

Reprint 2025-26



PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 143

Scientists also tried to know whether all plants have PGA as the first
product of CO  fixation, or whether any other product was formed in

2

other plants. Experiments conducted over a wide range of plants led to
the discovery of another group of plants, where the first stable product of
CO  fixation was again an organic acid, but one which had 4 carbon

2

atoms in it. This acid was identified to be oxaloacetic acid or OAA.  Since
then CO  assimilation during photosynthesis  was said to be of two main

2

types: those plants in which the first product of CO  fixation is a C  acid
2 3

(PGA), i.e., the C  pathway, and those in which the first product was a C
3 4

acid (OAA), i.e., the C  pathway.  These two groups of plants showed
4

other associated characteristics that we will discuss later.

11.7.1 The Primary Acceptor of CO
2

Let us now ask ourselves a question that was asked by the scientists who
were struggling to understand the ‘dark reaction’. How many carbon atoms
would a molecule have which after accepting (fixing) CO , would have 3

2

carbons (of PGA)?
The studies very unexpectedly showed that the acceptor molecule

was a 5-carbon ketose sugar – ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).  Did any
of you think of this possibility?  Do not worry; the scientists also took
a long time and conducted many experiments to reach this conclusion.
They also believed that since the first product was a C  acid, the primary

3

acceptor would be a 2-carbon compound; they spent many years trying
to identify a 2-carbon compound before they discovered the 5-carbon
RuBP.

11.7.2 The Calvin Cycle

Calvin and his co-workers then worked out the whole pathway and showed
that the pathway operated in a cyclic manner; the RuBP was regenerated.
Let us now see how the Calvin pathway operates and where the sugar is
synthesised.  Let us at the outset understand very clearly that the Calvin
pathway occurs in all photosynthetic plants; it does not matter whether
they have C  or C  (or any other) pathways (Figure 11.8).

3 4

For ease of understanding, the Calvin cycle can be described under
three stages: carboxylation, reduction and regeneration.

1. Carboxylation – Carboxylation is the fixation of CO  into a stable organic
2

intermediate.  Carboxylation is the most crucial step of the Calvin cycle
where CO  is utilised for the carboxylation of RuBP.  This reaction is

2

catalysed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylase which results in the formation
of two molecules of 3-PGA.  Since this enzyme also has an oxygenation
activity it would be more correct to call it RuBP carboxylase-oxygenase
or RuBisCO.

11.8 THE C  PATHWAY
4

Plants that are adapted to dry tropical regions have the C  pathway
4

mentioned earlier. Though these plants have the C  oxaloacetic acid as
4

the first CO  fixation product they use the C  pathway or the Calvin cycle
2 3

as the main biosynthetic pathway. Then, in what way are they different
from C  plants? This is a question that you may reasonably ask.

3

C  plants are special: They have a special type of leaf anatomy, they
4

tolerate higher temperatures, they show a response to high light intensities,
they lack a process called photorespiration and have greater productivity
of biomass. Let us understand these one by one.

Study vertical sections of leaves, one of a C  plant and the other of a C
3 4

plant. Do you notice the differences? Do both have the same types of
mesophylls?  Do they have similar cells around the vascular bundle sheath?

The particularly large cells around the vascular bundles of the C
4

plants are called bundle sheath cells, and the leaves which have such
anatomy are said to have ‘Kranz’ anatomy. ‘Kranz’ means ‘wreath’ and
is a reflection of the arrangement of cells.  The bundle sheath cells may
form several layers around the vascular bundles; they are characterised
by having a large number of chloroplasts, thick walls impervious to
gaseous exchange and no intercellular spaces. You may like to cut a
section of the leaves of C  plants – maize or sorghum – to observe the

4

Kranz anatomy and the distribution of mesophyll cells.
It would be interesting for you to collect leaves of diverse species of

plants around you and cut vertical sections of the leaves. Observe under
the microscope – look for the bundle sheath around the vascular
bundles.  The presence of the bundle sheath would help you identify
the C  plants.

146 BIOLOGY

Now study the pathway shown in Figure 11.9. This pathway that has
been named the Hatch and Slack Pathway, is again a cyclic process.  Let
us study the pathway by listing the steps.

The primary CO  acceptor is a 3-carbon molecule phosphoenol
2

pyruvate (PEP) and is present in the mesophyll cells. The enzyme
responsible for this fixation is PEP carboxylase or PEPcase. It is important
to register that the mesophyll cells lack RuBisCO enzyme. The C  acid

4

OAA is formed in the mesophyll cells.
It then forms other 4-carbon compounds like malic acid or aspartic

acid in the mesophyll cells itself, which are transported to the bundle
sheath cells.  In the bundle sheath cells these C  acids are broken down

4

to release CO  and a 3-carbon molecule.
2

The 3-carbon molecule is transported back to the mesophyll where it
is converted to PEP again, thus, completing the cycle.

The CO  released in the bundle sheath cells enters the C  or the Calvin
2 3

pathway, a pathway common to all plants. The bundle sheath cells are

Figure 11.9 Diagrammatic representation of the Hatch and Slack Pathway

Reprint 2025-26



PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 147

rich in an enzyme Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase
(RuBisCO), but lack PEPcase.  Thus, the basic pathway that results in
the formation of the sugars, the Calvin pathway, is common to the C  and

3

C  plants.
4

Did you note that the Calvin pathway occurs in all the mesophyll
cells of the C  plants? In the C  plants it does not take place in the

3 4

mesophyll cells but does so only in the bundle sheath cells.

11.9 PHOTORESPIRATION

Let us try and understand one more process that creates an important
difference between C  and C  plants – Photorespiration. To understand

3 4

photorespiration we have to know a little bit more about the first step of
the Calvin pathway – the first CO  fixation step. This is the  reaction

2

where RuBP combines with CO  to form 2 molecules of 3PGA, that is
2

catalysed by RuBisCO.

RuBP + CO RuBisCo→2 × 3PGA
2

RuBisCO that is the most abundant enzyme in the world (Do you
wonder why?) is characterised by the fact that its active site can bind to
both CO  and O  – hence the name. Can you think how this could be

2 2

possible? RuBisCO has a much greater affinity for CO  when the CO : O
2 2 2

is nearly equal. Imagine what would happen if this were not so! This
binding is competitive. It is the relative concentration of O  and CO  that

2 2

determines which of the two will bind to the enzyme.
In C  plants some O  does bind to RuBisCO, and hence CO  fixation is

3 2 2

decreased. Here the RuBP instead of being converted to  2 molecules of
PGA binds with O  to form one molecule of phosphoglycerate and

2

phosphoglycolate (2 Carbon) in a pathway called photorespiration. In
the photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars, nor of
ATP. Rather it results in the release of CO  with the utilisation of ATP. In

2

the photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH.
The biological function of photorespiration is not known yet.

In C  plants photorespiration does not occur. This is because they
4

have a mechanism that increases the concentration of CO  at the enzyme
2

site.  This takes place when the C  acid from the mesophyll is broken
4

down in the bundle sheath cells to release CO  – this results in increasing
2

the intracellular concentration of CO . In turn, this ensures that the
2

RuBisCO functions as a carboxylase minimising the oxygenase activity.
Now that you know that the C  plants lack photorespiration, you

4

probably can understand why productivity and yields are better in these
plants. In addition, these plants show tolerance to higher temperatures.

Based on the above discussion can you compare plants showing the
C  and the C  pathway?  Use the table format given in table 11.1 and fill

11.10 FACTORS AFFECTING PHOTOSYNTHESIS

An understanding of the factors that affect photosynthesis is necessary.
The rate of photosynthesis is very important in determining the yield of
plants including crop plants.  Photosynthesis is under the influence of
several factors, both internal (plant) and external. The plant factors include
the number, size, age and orientation of leaves, mesophyll cells and
chloroplasts, internal CO  concentration and the amount of chlorophyll.

2

The plant or internal factors are dependent on the genetic predisposition
and the growth of the plant.

The external factors would include the availability of sunlight,
temperature, CO  concentration and water.  As a plant photosynthesises,

2

all these factors will simultaneously affect its rate. Hence, though several
factors interact and simultaneously affect photosynthesis or CO  fixation,

2

usually one factor is the major cause or is the one that limits the rate.
Hence, at any point the rate will be determined by the factor available at
sub-optimal levels.

When several factors affect any [bio] chemical process, Blackman’s
(1905) Law of Limiting Factors comes into effect. This states the following:

If a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, then its
rate will be determined by the factor which is nearest to its minimal
value: it is the factor which directly affects the process if its quantity is
changed.

For example, despite the presence of a green
leaf and optimal light and CO  conditions, the

2

plant may not photosynthesise if the temperature
is very low. This leaf, if given the optimal
temperature, will start photosynthesising.

11.10.1 Light
B C

We need to distinguish between light quality, light E

intensity and the duration of exposure to light,
while discussing light as a factor that affects A

photosynthesis. There is a linear relationship
between incident light and CO  fixation rates at

2

low light intensities. At higher light intensities,
gradually the rate does not show further increase
as other factors become limiting (Figure 11.10). D

What is interesting to note is that light saturation Light intensity

occurs at 10 per cent of the full sunlight. Hence,
except for plants in shade or in dense forests, light Figure 11.10 Graph of light intensity on the
is rarely a limiting factor in nature. Increase in rate of photosynthesis

Reprint 2025-26

Rate of photosynthesis



150 BIOLOGY

incident light beyond a point causes the breakdown of chlorophyll and a
decrease in photosynthesis.

11.10.2 Carbon dioxide Concentration

Carbon dioxide is the major limiting factor for photosynthesis.  The
concentration of CO  is very low in the atmosphere (between 0.03 and

2

0.04 per cent). Increase in concentration upto 0.05 per cent can cause an
increase in CO  fixation rates; beyond this the levels can become damaging

2

over longer periods.
The C  and C  plants respond differently to CO  concentrations.  At

3 4 2

low light conditions neither group responds to high CO  conditions.  At
2

high light intensities, both C  and C plants show increase in the rates of
3 4 

photosynthesis. What is important to note is that the C  plants show
4

saturation at about 360 µlL-1 while C  responds to increased CO
3 2

concentration and saturation is seen only beyond 450 µlL-1.  Thus, current
availability of CO  levels is limiting to the C  plants.

2 3

The fact that C  plants respond to higher CO  concentration by
3 2

showing increased rates of photosynthesis leading to higher productivity
has been used for some greenhouse crops such as tomatoes and bell
pepper. They are allowed to grow in carbon dioxide enriched atmosphere
that leads to higher yields.

11.10.3  Temperature

The dark reactions being enzymatic are temperature controlled. Though
the light reactions are also temperature sensitive they are affected to a
much lesser extent. The C  plants respond to higher temperatures and

4

show higher rate of photosynthesis while C  plants have a much lower
3

temperature optimum.
The temperature optimum for photosynthesis of different plants also

depends on the habitat that they are adapted to.  Tropical plants have a
higher temperature optimum than the plants adapted to temperate
climates.

11.10.4  Water

Even though water is one of the reactants in the light reaction, the effect of
water as a factor is more through its effect on the plant, rather than directly
on photosynthesis. Water stress causes the stomata to close hence reducing
the CO  availability. Besides, water stress also makes leaves wilt, thus,

2

reducing the surface area of the leaves and their metabolic activity as well.

PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 151

SUMMARY

Green plants make their own food by photosynthesis. During this process carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere is taken in by leaves through stomata and used for
making carbohydrates, principally glucose and starch.  Photosynthesis takes place
only in the green parts of the plants, mainly the leaves. Within the leaves, the
mesophyll cells have a large number of chloroplasts that are responsible for CO

2

fixation.  Within the chloroplasts, the membranes are sites for the light reaction,
while the chemosynthetic pathway occurs in the stroma.  Photosynthesis has two
stages: the light reaction and the carbon fixing reactions. In the light reaction the
light energy is absorbed by the pigments present in the antenna, and funnelled to
special chlorophyll a molecules called reaction centre chlorophylls. There are two
photosystems, PS I and PS II. PS I has a 700 nm absorbing chlorophyll a P700
molecule at its reaction centre, while PS II has a P680 reaction centre that absorbs
red light at 680 nm.  After absorbing light, electrons are excited and transferred
through PS II and PS I and finally to NAD forming NADH. During this process a
proton gradient is created across the membrane of the thylakoid. The breakdown
of the protons gradient due to movement through the F  part of the ATPase enzyme

0

releases enough energy for synthesis of ATP.  Splitting of water molecules is
associated with PS II resulting in the release of O , protons and transfer of electrons

2

to PS II.
In the carbon fixation cycle, CO  is added by the enzyme, RuBisCO, to a 5-

2

carbon compound RuBP that is converted to 2 molecules of 3-carbon PGA. This
is then converted to sugar by the Calvin cycle, and the RuBP is regenerated. During
this process ATP and NADPH synthesised in the light reaction are utilised. RuBisCO
also catalyses a wasteful oxygenation reaction in C  plants: photorespiration.

3

Some tropical plants show a special type of photosynthesis called C  pathway.
4

In these plants the first product of CO  fixation that takes place in the mesophyll,
2

is a 4-carbon compound.  In the bundle sheath cells the Calvin pathway is carried
out for the synthesis of carbohydrates.

Balance Sheet
You may wonder at the several questions raised above – they may

12.6 Amphibolic seem to be very disconnected.  But in reality, the process of breathing is
Pathway very much connected to the process of release of energy from food.  Let us

try and understand how this happens.
12.7 Respiratory

All the energy required for ‘life’ processes is obtained by oxidation of
Quotient

some macromolecules that we call ‘food’. Green plants and cyanobacteria
can prepare their own food; by the process of photosynthesis they trap
light energy and convert it into chemical energy that is stored in the bonds
of carbohydrates like glucose, sucrose and starch.  We must remember
that in green plants too, not all cells, tissues and organs photosynthesise;
only cells containing chloroplasts, that are most often located in the
superficial layers, carry out photosynthesis.  Hence, even in green plants
all other organs, tissues and cells that are non-green, need food for
oxidation. Hence, food has to be translocated to all non-green parts.
Animals are heterotrophic, i.e., they obtain food from plants

directly (herbivores) or indirectly (carnivores). Saprophytes like fungi are
dependent on dead and decaying matter.  What is important to recognise
is that ultimately all the food that is respired for life processes comes from
photosynthesis. This chapter deals with cellular respiration or the
mechanism of breakdown of food materials within the cell to release
energy, and the trapping of this energy for synthesis of ATP.

Photosynthesis, of course, takes place within the chloroplasts (in the
eukaryotes), whereas the breakdown of complex molecules to yield energy
takes place in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria  (also only in
eukaryotes).  The breaking of the C-C bonds of complex compounds
through oxidation within the cells, leading to release of considerable
amount of energy is called respiration.  The compounds that are oxidised
during this process are known as respiratory substrates. Usually
carbohydrates are oxidised to release energy, but proteins, fats and even
organic acids can be used as respiratory substances in some plants, under
certain conditions.  During oxidation within a cell, all the energy contained
in respiratory substrates is not released free into the cell, or in a single
step. It is released in a series of slow step-wise reactions controlled by
enzymes, and it is trapped as chemical energy in the form of ATP.  Hence,
it is important to understand that the energy released by oxidation in
respiration is not (or rather cannot be) used directly but is used to
synthesise ATP, which is broken down whenever (and wherever) energy
needs to be utilised. Hence, ATP acts as the energy currency of the cell.
This energy trapped in ATP is utilised in various energy-requiring
processes of the organisms, and the carbon skeleton produced during
respiration is used as precursors for biosynthesis of other molecules in
the cell.

12.1 DO PLANTS BREATHE?

Well, the answer to this question is not quite so direct.  Yes, plants require
O  for respiration to occur and they also give out CO .  Hence, plants have

2 2

systems in place that ensure the availability of O .  Plants, unlike animals,
2

have no specialised organs for gaseous exchange but they have stomata
and lenticels for this purpose. There are several reasons why plants can
get along without respiratory organs. First, each plant part takes care of
its own gas-exchange needs.  There is very little transport of gases from
one plant part to another.  Second, plants do not present great demands
for gas exchange.  Roots, stems and leaves respire at rates far lower than
animals do. Only during photosynthesis are large volumes of gases
exchanged and, each leaf is well adapted to take care of its own needs
during these periods. When cells photosynthesise, availability of O  is not

2

a problem in these cells since O  is released within the cell.  Third, the
2

RESPIRATION IN PLANTS 155

distance that gases must diffuse even in large, bulky plants is not great.
Each living cell in a plant is located quite close to the surface of the plant.
‘This is true for leaves’, you may ask, ‘but what about thick, woody stems
and roots?’ In stems, the ‘living’ cells are organised in thin layers inside
and beneath the bark. They also have openings called lenticels. The cells
in the interior are dead and provide only mechanical support. Thus, most
cells of a plant have at least a part of their surface in contact with air. This
is also facilitated by the loose packing of parenchyma cells in leaves, stems
and roots, which provide an interconnected network of air spaces.

The complete combustion of glucose, which produces CO  and H O
2 2

as end products, yields energy most of which is given out as heat.

C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O+ Energy

If this energy is to be useful to the cell, it should be able to utilise it to
synthesise other molecules that the cell requires.  The strategy that the
plant cell uses is to catabolise the glucose molecule in such a way that
not all the liberated energy goes out as heat.  The key is to oxidise glucose
not in one step but in several small steps enabling some steps to be just
large enough such that the energy released can be coupled to ATP
synthesis.  How this is done is, essentially, the story of respiration.

During the process of respiration, oxygen is utilised, and carbon
dioxide, water and energy are released as products. The combustion
reaction requires oxygen. But some cells live where oxygen may or may
not be available. Can you think of such situations (and organisms) where
O  is not available?   There are sufficient reasons to believe that the first

2

cells on this planet lived in an atmosphere that lacked oxygen.  Even
among present-day living organisms, we know of several that are adapted
to anaerobic conditions.  Some of these organisms are facultative
anaerobes, while in others the requirement for anaerobic condition is
obligate.  In any case, all living organisms retain the enzymatic machinery
to partially oxidise glucose without the help of oxygen.  This breakdown
of glucose to pyruvic acid is called glycolysis.

12.2 GLYCOLYSIS

The term glycolysis has originated from the Greek words, glycos for sugar,
and lysis for splitting.  The scheme of glycolysis was given by Gustav
Embden, Otto Meyerhof, and J. Parnas, and is often referred to as the
EMP pathway. In anaerobic organisms, it is the only process in respiration.
Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and is present in all living
organisms.  In this process, glucose undergoes partial oxidation to form
two molecules of pyruvic acid. In plants, this glucose is derived from
sucrose, which is the end product of photosynthesis, or from storage

and fructose by the enzyme, invertase, and these
two monosaccharides readily enter the glycolytic
pathway. Glucose and fructose are

RESPIRATION IN PLANTS 157

There are three major ways in which different cells handle pyruvic acid
produced by glycolysis.  These are lactic acid fermentation, alcoholic
fermentation and aerobic respiration. Fermentation takes place under
anaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes.
For the complete oxidation of glucose to CO  and H O, however, organisms

2 2

adopt Krebs’ cycle which is also called as aerobic respiration. This requires
O  supply.

12.3 FERMENTATION

In fermentation, say by yeast, the incomplete oxidation of glucose is
achieved under anaerobic conditions by sets of reactions where pyruvic
acid is converted to CO  and ethanol. The enzymes, pyruvic acid

2

decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase catalyse these reactions. Other
organisms like some bacteria produce lactic acid from pyruvic acid.  The
steps involved are shown in Figure 12.2. In animal cells also, like muscles
during exercise, when oxygen is inadequate for cellular respiration pyruvic
acid is reduced to lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase.  The reducing
agent is NADH+H+  which is reoxidised to NAD+

in both the processes.
In both lactic acid and alcohol

fermentation not much energy is released; less
than seven per cent of the energy in glucose is
released and not all of it is trapped as high
energy bonds of ATP.  Also, the processes are
hazardous – either acid or alcohol is produced.
What is the net ATPs that is synthesised
(calculate how many ATP are synthesised and
deduct the number of ATP utilised during
glycolysis) when one molecule of glucose is
fermented to alcohol or lactic acid?  Yeasts
poison themselves to death when the
concentration of alcohol reaches about 13 per
cent. What then would be the maximum
concentration of alcohol in beverages that
are naturally fermented? How do you think
alcoholic beverages of alcohol content greater
than this concentration are obtained?

synthesise a larger number of ATP molecules needed for cellular
metabolism?  In eukaryotes these steps take place within the mitochondria
and this requires O .Aerobic respiration is the process that leads to a

2  

complete oxidation of organic substances in the presence of oxygen, and
releases CO , water and a large amount of energy present in the substrate.

2

This type of respiration is most common in higher organisms. We will
look at these processes in the next section.

12.4 AEROBIC RESPIRATION

For aerobic respiration to take place within the mitochondria, the final
product of glycolysis, pyruvate is transported from the cytoplasm into
the mitochondria.  The crucial events in aerobic respiration are:

• The complete oxidation of pyruvate by the stepwise removal of all
the hydrogen atoms, leaving three molecules of CO .

2

• The passing on of the electrons removed as part of the hydrogen
atoms to molecular O  with simultaneous synthesis of ATP.

2 

What is interesting to note is that the first process takes place in the
matrix of the mitochondria while the second process is located on the
inner membrane of the mitochondria.

Pyruvate, which is formed by the glycolytic catabolism of carbohydrates
in the cytosol, after it enters mitochondrial matrix undergoes oxidative
decarboxylation by a complex set of reactions catalysed by pyruvic
dehydrogenase. The reactions catalysed by pyruvic dehydrogenase require
the participation of several coenzymes, including NAD+ and  Coenzyme A.

During this process, two molecules of NADH are produced from the
metabolism of two molecules of pyruvic acid (produced from one glucose
molecule during glycolysis).

The acetyl CoA then enters a cyclic pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle,
more commonly called as Krebs’ cycle after the scientist Hans Krebs who
first elucidated it.

12.4.1 Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle

The TCA cycle starts with the condensation of acetyl group with oxaloacetic
acid (OAA) and water to yield citric acid (Figure 12.3). The reaction is
catalysed by the enzyme citrate synthase and a molecule of CoA is released.
Citrate is then isomerised to isocitrate.  It is followed by two successive
steps of decarboxylation, leading to the formation of α-ketoglutaric acid

produced in the mitochondrial matrix
during citric acid cycle are oxidised by
an NADH dehydrogenase (complex I),
and electrons are then transferred to
ubiquinone located within the inner
membrane. Ubiquinone also receives
reducing equivalents via FADH  (complex

2

II) that is generated during oxidation of
succinate in the citric acid cycle. The
reduced ubiquinone (ubiquinol) is then
oxidised with the transfer of electrons to
cytochrome c via cytochrome bc

complex (complex III). Cytochrome c is a
small protein attached to the outer
surface of the inner membrane and acts
as a mobile carrier for transfer of
electrons between complex III and IV.
Complex IV refers to cytochrome c
oxidase complex containing cytochromes
a and a , and two copper centres.

When the electrons pass from one
carrier to another via complex I to IV in
the electron transport chain, they are
coupled to ATP synthase (complex V) for
the production of ATP from ADP and
inorganic phosphate. The number of ATP
molecules synthesised depends on the
nature of the electron donor. Oxidation
of one molecule of NADH gives rise to 3
molecules of ATP, while that of one
molecule of FADH  produces 2 molecules

of ATP. Although the aerobic process of
respiration takes place only in the
presence of oxygen, the role of oxygen is

limited to the terminal stage of the
process.  Yet, the presence of oxygen is

vital, since it drives the whole process by removing hydrogen from the
system. Oxygen acts as the final hydrogen acceptor. Unlike
photophosphorylation where it is the light energy that is utilised for the
production of proton gradient required for phosphorylation, in respiration
it is the energy of oxidation-reduction utilised for the same process. It is
for this reason that the process is called oxidative phosphorylation.

12.5 THE RESPIRATORY BALANCE SHEET

It is possible to make calculations of the net gain of ATP for every
glucose molecule  oxidised; but in reality this can remain only a
theoretical exercise. These calculations can be made only on certain
assumptions that:

• There is a sequential, orderly pathway functioning, with one
substrate forming the next and with glycolysis, TCA cycle and
ETS pathway following one after another.

• The NADH synthesised in glycolysis is transferred into the
mitochondria and undergoes oxidative phosphorylation.

• None of the intermediates in the pathway are utilised to synthesise
any other compound.

• Only glucose is being respired – no other alternative substrates
are entering in the pathway at any of the intermediary stages.

But this kind of assumptions are not really valid in a living system;
all pathways work simultaneously and do not take place one after
another; substrates enter the pathways and are withdrawn from it as
and when necessary; ATP is utilised as and when needed;  enzymatic
rates are controlled by multiple means.  Yet, it is useful to do this
exercise to appreciate the beauty and efficiency of the living system in
extraction and storing energy. Hence, there can be a net gain of 38 ATP
molecules during aerobic respiration of one molecule of glucose.

Reprint 2025-26



162 BIOLOGY

Now let us  compare  fermentation and aerobic respiration:

• Fermentation accounts for only a partial breakdown of glucose
whereas in aerobic respiration it is completely degraded to CO  and

2

H O.
2

• In fermentation there is a net gain of only two molecules of ATP for
each molecule of glucose degraded to pyruvic acid whereas many
more molecules of ATP are generated under aerobic conditions.

• NADH is oxidised to NAD+ rather slowly in fermentation, however
the reaction is very vigorous in case of aerobic respiration.

12.6 AMPHIBOLIC PATHWAY

Glucose is the favoured substrate for respiration.  All carbohydrates are
usually first converted into glucose before they are used for respiration.
Other substrates can also be respired, as has been mentioned earlier, but
then they do not enter the respiratory pathway at the first step. See Figure
12.6 to see the points of entry of different substrates in the respiratory
pathway. Fats would need to be broken down into glycerol and fatty acids
first. If fatty acids were to be respired they would first be degraded to
acetyl CoA and enter the pathway. Glycerol would enter the pathway
after being converted to PGAL. The proteins would be degraded by
proteases and the individual amino acids (after deamination) depending
on their structure would enter the pathway at some stage within the Krebs’
cycle or even as pyruvate or acetyl CoA.

Since respiration involves breakdown of substrates, the respiratory
process has traditionally been considered a catabolic process and the
respiratory pathway as a catabolic pathway.  But is this understanding
correct?  We have discussed above, at which points in the respiratory
pathway different substrates would enter if they were to be respired and
used to derive energy. What is important to recognise is that it is these very
compounds that would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for the
synthesis of the said substrates. Hence, fatty acids would be broken down
to acetyl CoA before entering the respiratory pathway when it is used as a
substrate. But when the organism needs to synthesise fatty acids, acetyl
CoA would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for it. Hence, the
respiratory pathway comes into the picture both during breakdown and
synthesis of fatty acids. Similarly, during breakdown and synthesis of
protein too, respiratory intermediates form the link. Breaking down
processes within the living organism is catabolism, and synthesis is
anabolism.  Because the respiratory pathway is involved in both anabolism
and catabolism, it would hence be better to consider the respiratory pathway
as an amphibolic pathway rather than as a catabolic one.

12.7 RESPIRATORY QUOTIENT

Let us now look at another aspect of respiration. As you know, during
aerobic respiration, O  is consumed and CO  is released. The ratio of the

2 2

volume of CO  evolved to the volume of O  consumed in respiration is
2 2

called the respiratory quotient (RQ) or respiratory ratio.

volumeof CO
R 2 evolved

Q =
volumeof O2 consumed

The respiratory quotient depends upon the type of respiratory
substrate used during respiration.

When carbohydrates are used as substrate and are completely
oxidised, the RQ will be 1, because equal amounts of CO  and O  are

2 2

evolved and consumed, respectively, as shown in the equation below :

When fats are used in respiration, the RQ is less than 1. Calculations
for a fatty acid, tripalmitin, if used as a substrate is shown:

2(C51H98O6 )+145O2 →102CO2 + 98H2O+ energy

        Tripalmitin

= 102CO
RQ 2 = 0.7

145O2

When proteins are respiratory substrates the ratio would be about
0.9.

What is important to recognise is that in living organisms, respiratory
substrates are often more than one; pure proteins or fats are never
used as respiratory substrates.

SUMMARY

Plants unlike animals have no special systems for breathing or gaseous exchange.
Stomata and lenticels allow gaseous exchange by diffusion. Almost all living cells
in a plant have their surfaces exposed to air.

The breaking of C-C bonds of complex organic molecules by oxidation leading
to the release of a lot of energy is called cellular respiration. Glucose is the
favoured substrate for respiration. Fats and proteins can also be broken down to
yield energy. The initial stage of cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm.
Each glucose molecule is broken through a series of enzyme catalysed reactions
into two molecules of pyruvic acid. This process is called glycolysis. The fate of the
pyruvate depends on the availability of oxygen and the organism. Under anaerobic
conditions either lactic acid fermentation or alcohol fermentation occurs.
Fermentation takes place under anaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes,
unicellular eukaryotes and in germinating seeds. In eukaryotic organisms aerobic
respiration occurs  in the presence of oxygen. Pyruvic acid is transported into the
mitochondria where it is converted into acetyl CoA with the release of CO . Acetyl

2

CoA then enters the tricarboxylic acid pathway or Krebs’ cycle operating in the
matrix of the mitochondria. NADH + H+ and FADH  are generated in the Krebs’

2

cycle. The energy in these molecules as well as that in the NADH + H+ synthesised
during glycolysis are used to synthesise ATP. This is accomplished through a

Reprint 2025-26



RESPIRATION IN PLANTS 165

system of electron carriers called electron transport system (ETS) located on the
inner membrane of the mitochondria. The electrons, as they move through the
system, release enough energy that are trapped to synthesise ATP. This is called
oxidative phosphorylation. In this process O  is the ultimate acceptor of electrons

2

and it gets reduced to water.
The respiratory pathway is an amphibolic pathway as it involves both anabolism

and catabolism. The respiratory quotient depends upon the type of respiratory
substance used during respiration.

there any relationship between the structure of a cell, a tissue, an organ
and the function they perform? Can the structure and the function of these
be altered? All cells of a plant are descendents of the zygote. The question
is, then, why and how do they have different structural and functional
attributes? Development is the sum of two processes: growth and
differentiation. To begin with, it is essential and sufficient to know that the
development of a mature plant from a zygote (fertilised egg) follow a precise
and highly ordered succession of events. During this process a complex
body organisation is formed that produces roots, leaves, branches, flowers,
fruits, and seeds, and eventually they die (Figure 13.1). The first step in the
process of plant growth is seed germination. The seed germinates when
favourable conditions for growth exist in the environment. In absence of
such favourable conditions the seeds do not germinate and goes into a
period of suspended growth or rest. Once favourable conditions return,
the seeds resume metabolic activities and growth takes place.

In this chapter, you shall also study some of the factors which
govern and control these developmental processes. These factors are both
intrinsic (internal) and extrinsic (external) to the plant.

13.1 GROWTH

Growth is regarded as one of the most fundamental and conspicuous
characteristics of a living being. What is growth? Growth can be defined
as an irreversible permanent increase in size of an organ or its parts or
even of an individual cell. Generally, growth is accompanied by metabolic
processes (both anabolic and catabolic), that occur at the expense of
energy. Therefore, for example, expansion of a leaf is growth. How would
you describe the swelling of piece of wood when placed in water?

13.1.1  Plant Growth Generally is Indeterminate

Plant growth is unique because plants retain the capacity for unlimited
growth throughout their life. This ability of the plants is due to the presence
of meristems at certain locations in their body. The cells of such meristems
have the capacity to divide and self-perpetuate. The product, however,
soon loses the capacity to divide and such cells make up the plant body.
This form of growth wherein new cells are always being added to the
plant body by the activity of the meristem is called the open form of growth.
What would happen if the meristem ceases to divide? Does this ever
happen?

In earlier classes, you have studied about the root apical meristem
and the shoot apical meristem. You know that they are responsible for

168 BIOLOGY

Shoot apical the primary growth of the plants and principally
meristem contribute to the elongation of the plants along

their axis. You also know that in dicotyledonous

vascular cambium and cork-cambium appear
later in life. These are the meristems that cause

G three phases, namely, meristematic, elongation

meristematic zone represent the phase of elongation. Increased
vacuolation, cell enlargement and new cell wall deposition are the
characteristics of the cells in this phase. Further away from the apex, i.e.,
more proximal to the phase of elongation, lies the portion of axis which is
undergoing the phase of maturation. The cells of this zone, attain their
maximal size in terms of wall thickening and protoplasmic modifications.
Most of the tissues and cell types you have studied in earlier classes
represent this phase.

13.1.4  Growth Rates

The increased growth per unit time is termed as growth rate. Thus, rate
of growth can be expressed mathematically. An organism, or a part of the
organism can produce more cells in a variety of ways.

Figure13.4 Diagrammatic representation of : (a) Arithmetic (b) Geometric growth and
(c) Stages during embryo development showing geometric and arithematic
phases

Reprint 2025-26



170 BIOLOGY

The growth rate shows an increase that may be
arithmetic or geometrical (Figure 13.4).

In arithmetic growth, following mitotic cell
division, only one daughter cell continues to divide
while the other differentiates and matures. The
simplest expression of arithmetic growth is
exemplified by a root elongating at a constant rate.
Look at Figure 13.5. On plotting the length of the
organ against time, a linear curve is obtained.
Mathematically, it is expressed as

L  = L  + rt
t 0

L  = length at time ‘t’
t

L  = length at time ‘zero’
0

r    = growth rate / elongation per unit time.

Let us now see what happens in geometrical
growth. In most systems, the initial growth is slow
(lag phase), and it increases rapidly thereafter – at

Figure 13.5 Constant linear growth, a plot an exponential rate (log or exponential phase). Here,
of length L against time t both the progeny cells following mitotic cell division

retain the ability to divide and continue to do so.
However, with limited nutrient supply, the growth
slows down leading to a stationary phase. If we plot
the parameter of growth against time, we get a typical
sigmoid or S-curve (Figure 13.6). A sigmoid curve
is a characteristic of living organism growing in a

Stationary phase natural environment. It is typical for all cells, tissues
and organs of a plant. Can you think of more similar
examples? What kind of a curve can you expect in

Quantitative comparisons between the growth of living system can

growth per unit time is called the absolute growth rate. (ii) The growth of
the given system per unit time expressed on a common basis, e.g., per
unit initial parameter is called the relative growth rate. In Figure 13.7
two leaves, A and B, are drawn that are of different sizes but shows
absolute increase in area in the given time to give leaves, A1 and B1. However,
one of them shows much higher relative growth rate. Which one and why?

13.1.5 Conditions for Growth

Why do you not try to write down what you think are necessary conditions
for growth? This list may have water, oxygen and nutrients as very essential
elements for growth. The plant cells grow in size by cell enlargement which
in turn requires water. Turgidity of cells helps in extension growth. Thus,
plant growth and further development is intimately linked to the water
status of the plant. Water also provides the medium for enzymatic activities
needed for growth. Oxygen helps in releasing metabolic energy essential
for growth activities. Nutrients (macro and micro essential elements) are
required by plants for the synthesis of protoplasm and act as source of
energy.

In addition, every plant organism has an optimum temperature range
best suited for its growth. Any deviation from this range could be
detrimental to its survival. Environmental signals such as light and gravity
also affect certain phases/stages of growth.

172 BIOLOGY

13.2 DIFFERENTIATION, DEDIFFERENTIATION AND

REDIFFERENTIATION

The cells derived from root apical and shoot-apical meristems and
cambium differentiate and mature to perform specific functions. This act
leading to maturation is termed as differentiation. During differentiation,
cells undergo few to major structural changes both in their cell walls and
protoplasm. For example, to form a tracheary element, the cells would
lose their protoplasm. They also develop a very strong, elastic,
lignocellulosic secondary cell walls, to carry water to long distances even
under extreme tension. Try to correlate the various anatomical features
you encounter in plants to the functions they perform.

Plants show another interesting phenomenon. The living differentiated
cells, that by now have lost the capacity to divide can regain the capacity
of division under certain conditions. This phenomenon is termed as
dedifferentiation. For example, formation of meristems – interfascicular
cambium and cork cambium from fully differentiated parenchyma cells.
While doing so, such meristems/tissues are able to divide and produce
cells that once again lose the capacity to divide but mature to perform
specific functions, i.e., get redifferentiated. List some of the tissues in a
woody dicotyledenous plant that are the products of redifferentiation.
How would you describe a tumour? What would you call the parenchyma
cells that are made to divide under controlled laboratory conditions during
plant tissue culture?

Recall, in Section 13.1.1, we have mentioned that the growth in plants
is open, i.e., it can be indeterminate or determinate. Now, we may say that
even differentiation in plants is open, because cells/tissues arising out of
the same meristem have different structures at maturity. The final
structure at maturity of a cell/tissue is also determined by the location of
the cell within. For example, cells positioned away from root apical
meristems differentiate as root-cap cells, while those pushed to the
periphery mature as epidermis. Can you add a few more examples of
open differentiation correlating the position of a cell to  its position in an
organ?

13.3  DEVELOPMENT

Development is a term that includes all changes that an organism goes
through during its life cycle from germination of the seed to senescence.
Diagrammatic representation of the sequence of processes which
constitute the development of a cell of a higher plant is given in Figure
13.8. It is also applicable to tissues/organs.

Plants follow different pathways in response to environment or phases
of life to form different kinds of structures. This ability is called plasticity,
e.g., heterophylly in cotton, coriander and larkspur. In such plants, the
leaves of the juvenile plant are different in shape from those in mature
plants. On the other hand, difference in shapes of leaves produced in air
and those produced in water in buttercup also represent the
heterophyllous development due to environment (Figure 13.9). This
phenomenon of heterophylly is an example of plasticity.

174 BIOLOGY

Thus, growth, differentiation and development are very closely related
events in the life of a plant. Broadly, development is considered as the
sum of growth and differentiation. Development in plants (i.e., both growth
and differentiation) is under the control of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
The former includes both intracellular (genetic) or intercellular factors
(chemicals such as plant growth regulators) while the latter includes light,
temperature, water, oxygen, nutrition, etc.

13.4 PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS

13.4.1 Characteristics

The plant growth regulators (PGRs) are small, simple molecules of diverse
chemical composition. They could be indole compounds (indole-3-acetic
acid, IAA); adenine derivatives (N6-furfurylamino purine, kinetin),
derivatives of carotenoids (abscisic acid, ABA); terpenes (gibberellic acid,
GA ) or gases (ethylene, C H ). Plant growth regulators are variously

3 2 4

described as plant growth substances, plant hormones or phytohormones
in literature.

The PGRs can be broadly divided into two groups based on their
functions in a living plant body. One group of PGRs are involved in growth
promoting activities, such as cell division, cell enlargement, pattern
formation, tropic growth, flowering, fruiting and seed formation. These
are also called plant growth promoters, e.g., auxins, gibberellins and
cytokinins. The PGRs of the other group play an important role in plant
responses to wounds and stresses of biotic and abiotic origin. They are
also involved in various growth inhibiting activities such as dormancy
and abscission. The PGR abscisic acid belongs to this group. The gaseous
PGR, ethylene, could fit either of the groups, but it is largely an inhibitor
of growth activities.

13.4.2  The Discovery of Plant Growth Regulators

Interestingly, the discovery of each of the five
major groups of PGRs have been accidental.
All this started with the observation of Charles
Darwin and his son Francis Darwin when they

The ‘bakanae’ (foolish seedling) disease of rice seedlings, was caused
by a fungal pathogen Gibberella fujikuroi. E. Kurosawa (1926) reported
the appearance of symptoms of the disease in rice seedlings when they
were treated with sterile filtrates of the fungus. The active substances
were later identified as gibberellic acid.

F. Skoog and his co-workers observed that from the internodal
segments of tobacco stems, the callus (a mass of undifferentiated cells)
proliferated only if, in addition to auxins the nutrients medium was
supplemented with one of the following: extracts of vascular tissues, yeast
extract, coconut milk or DNA. Miller et al. (1955), later identified and
crystallised the cytokinesis promoting active substance that they
termed kinetin.

During mid-1960s, three independent researches reported the
purification and chemical characterisation of three different kinds of
inhibitors: inhibitor-B, abscission II and dormin. Later all the three were
proved to be chemically identical. It was named abscisic acid (ABA).

H.H. Cousins (1910) confirmed the release of a volatile substance from
ripened oranges that hastened the ripening of stored unripened bananas.
Later this volatile substance was identified as ethylene, a gaseous PGR.

Let us study some of the physiological effects of these five categories
of PGRs in the next section.

13.4.3  Physiological Effects of Plant Growth Regulators

13.4.3.1 Auxins

Auxins (from Greek ‘auxein’ : to grow) was first isolated from human
urine. The term ‘auxin’ is applied to the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and
to other natural and synthetic compounds having certain growth
regulating properties. They are generally produced by the growing apices
of the stems and roots, from where they migrate to the regions of their
action. Auxins like IAA and indole butyric acid (IBA) have been isolated
from plants. NAA (naphthalene acetic acid) and 2, 4-D (2, 4-
dichlorophenoxyacetic) are synthetic auxins. All these auxins have been
used extensively in agricultural and horticultural practices.

They help to initiate rooting in stem cuttings, an application widely
used for plant propagation. Auxins promote flowering e.g. in pineapples.
They help to prevent fruit and leaf drop at early stages but promote the
abscission  of older mature leaves and fruits.

In most higher plants, the growing apical bud inhibits the growth of
the lateral (axillary) buds, a phenomenon called apical dominance.
Removal of shoot tips (decapitation) usually results in the growth of lateral
buds (Figure 13.11). It is widely applied in tea plantations and
hedge-making. Can you explain why?

Reprint 2025-26



176 BIOLOGY

Auxins also induce parthenocarpy, e.g., in
tomatoes. They are widely used as herbicides.
2, 4-D, widely used to kill dicotyledonous
weeds, does not affect mature
monocotyledonous plants. It is used to prepare
weed-free lawns by gardeners. Auxin also
controls xylem differentiation and helps in cell
division.

13.4.3.2 Gibberellins

Gibberellins are another kind of promotory

PGR. There are more than 100 gibberellins

reported from widely different organisms such

most intensively studied form. All GAs are

acidic. They produce a wide range of physiological responses in the plants.

Their ability to cause an increase in length of axis is used to increase the

length of grapes stalks. Gibberellins, cause fruits like apple to elongate

and improve its shape. They also delay senescence. Thus, the fruits can

be left on the tree longer so as to extend the market period. GA  is used to
3

speed up the malting process in brewing industry.

Sugarcane stores carbohydrate as sugar in their stems. Spraying

sugarcane crop with gibberellins increases the length of the stem, thus

increasing the yield by as much as 20 tonnes per acre.

Spraying juvenile conifers with GAs hastens the maturity period, thus

leading to early seed production. Gibberellins also promotes bolting

(internode elongation just prior to flowering) in beet, cabbages and many

plants with rosette habit.

13.4.3.3 Cytokinins

Cytokinins have specific effects on cytokinesis, and were discovered as

kinetin (a modified form of adenine, a purine) from the autoclaved herring

sperm DNA. Kinetin does not occur naturally in plants. Search for natural

substances with cytokinin-like activities led to the isolation of zeatin from

corn-kernels and coconut milk. Since the discovery of zeatin, several

naturally occurring cytokinins, and some synthetic compounds with cell

division promoting activity, have been identified. Natural cytokinins are

Reprint 2025-26



PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 177

synthesised in regions where rapid cell division occurs, for example, root

apices, developing shoot buds, young fruits etc. It helps to produce new

leaves, chloroplasts in leaves, lateral shoot growth and adventitious shoot

formation. Cytokinins help overcome the apical dominance. They promote

nutrient mobilisation which helps in the delay of leaf senescence.

13.4.3.4 Ethylene

Ethylene is a simple gaseous PGR. It is synthesised in large amounts

by tissues undergoing senescence and ripening fruits. Influences of

ethylene on plants include horizontal growth of seedlings, swelling of

the axis and apical hook formation in dicot seedlings. Ethylene promotes

senescence and abscission of plant organs especially of leaves and

flowers. Ethylene is highly effective in fruit ripening. It enhances the

respiration rate during ripening of the fruits. This rise in rate of

respiration is called respiratory climactic.

Ethylene breaks seed and bud dormancy, initiates germination in

peanut seeds, sprouting of potato tubers. Ethylene promotes rapid

internode/petiole elongation in deep water rice plants. It helps leaves/

upper parts of the shoot to remain above water. Ethylene also promotes

root growth and root hair formation, thus helping the plants to increase

their absorption surface.

Ethylene is used to initiate flowering and for synchronising fruit-set

in pineapples. It also induces flowering in mango. Since ethylene regulates

so many physiological processes, it is one of the most widely used PGR in

agriculture. The most widely used compound as source of ethylene is

ethephon. Ethephon in an aqueous solution is readily absorbed and

transported within the plant and releases ethylene slowly. Ethephon

hastens fruit ripening in tomatoes and apples and accelerates abscission

in flowers and fruits (thinning of cotton, cherry, walnut). It promotes female

flowers in cucumbers thereby increasing the yield.

13.4.3.5 Abscisic acid

As mentioned earlier, abscisic acid (ABA) was discovered for its role in

regulating abscission and dormancy. But like other PGRs, it also has

other wide ranging effects on plant growth and development. It acts as a

general plant growth inhibitor and an inhibitor of plant metabolism.

ABA inhibits seed germination. ABA stimulates the closure of stomata

and increases the tolerance of plants to various kinds of stresses.

Therefore, it is also called the stress hormone. ABA plays an important

Reprint 2025-26



178 BIOLOGY

role in seed development, maturation and dormancy. By inducing

dormancy, ABA helps seeds to withstand desiccation and other factors

unfavourable for growth. In most situations, ABA acts as an antagonist

to GAs.
We may summarise that for any and every phase of growth,

differentiation and development of plants, one or the other PGR has some
role to play. Such roles could be complimentary or antagonistic. These
could be individualistic or synergistic.

Similarly, there are a number of events in the life of a plant where
more than one PGR interact to affect that event, e.g., dormancy in seeds/
buds, abscission, senescence, apical dominance, etc.

Remember, the role of PGR is of only one kind of intrinsic control.
Along with genomic control and extrinsic factors, they play an important
role in plant growth and development. Many of the extrinsic factors such
as temperature and light, control plant growth and development via PGR.
Some of such events could be: vernalisation, flowering, dormancy, seed
germination, plant movements, etc.

We shall discuss briefly the role of light and temperature (both of them,
the extrinsic factors) on initiation of flowering.

SUMMARY

Growth is one of the most conspicuous events in any living organism. It is
an irreversible increase expressed in parameters such as size, area, length,
height, volume, cell number etc. It conspicuously involves increased
protoplasmic material. In plants, meristems are the sites of growth. Root
and shoot apical meristems sometimes alongwith intercalary meristem,
contribute to the elongation growth of plant axes. Growth is indeterminate
in higher plants. Following cell division in root and shoot apical meristem
cells, the growth could be arithmetic or geometrical. Growth may not be
and generally is not sustained at a high rate throughout the life of cell/
tissue/organ/organism. One can define three principle phases of growth
– the lag, the log and the senescent phase. When a cell loses the capacity
to divide, it leads to differentiation. Differentiation results in development
of structures that is commensurate with the function the cells finally has
to perform. General principles for differentiation for cell, tissues and organs
are similar. A differentiated cell may dedifferentiate and then redifferentiate.
Since differentiation in plants is open, the development could also be
flexible, i.e., the development is the sum of growth and differentiation.
Plant exhibit plasticity in development.

PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 179

Plant growth and development are under the control of both intrinsic
and extrinsic factors. Intercellular intrinsic factors are the chemical
substances, called plant growth regulators (PGR). There are diverse groups
of PGRs in plants, principally belonging to five groups: auxins, gibberellins,
cytokinins, abscisic acid and ethylene. These PGRs are synthesised in
various parts of the plant; they control different differentiation and
developmental events. Any PGR has diverse physiological effects on plants.
Diverse PGRs also manifest similar effects. PGRs may act synergistically
or antagonistically. Plant growth and development is also affected by light,
temperature, nutrition, oxygen status, gravity and such external factors.

of gases. Among vertebrates, fishes use gills whereas amphibians, reptiles,

respire through their moist skin (cutaneous respiration) also.

184 BIOLOGY

14.1.1 Human Respiratory System

We have a pair of external nostrils opening out above the upper lips.
It leads to a nasal chamber through the nasal passage. The nasal
chamber opens into the pharynx, a portion of which is the common
passage for food and air. The pharynx opens through the larynx region
into the trachea. Larynx is a cartilaginous box which helps in sound
production and hence called the sound box. During swallowing glottis
can be covered by a thin elastic cartilaginous flap called epiglottis  to
prevent the entry of food into the larynx. Trachea is a straight tube
extending up to the mid-thoracic cavity, which divides at the level of
5th thoracic vertebra into a right and left primary bronchi. Each bronchi
undergoes repeated divisions to form the secondary and tertiary bronchi
and bronchioles ending up in very thin terminal bronchioles. The
tracheae, primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi, and initial
bronchioles are supported by incomplete cartilaginous rings. Each
terminal bronchiole gives rise to a number of very thin, irregular-walled
and vascularised bag-like structures called alveoli. The branching
network of bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli comprise the lungs (Figure
14.1). We have two lungs which are covered by a double layered pleura,
with pleural fluid between them. It reduces friction on the lung-surface.
The outer pleural membrane is in close contact with the thoracic

lining whereas the inner pleural membrane is in contact with the lung
surface. The part starting with the external nostrils up to the terminal
bronchioles constitute the conducting part whereas the alveoli and their
ducts form the respiratory or exchange part of the respiratory system.
The conducting part transports the atmospheric air to the alveoli, clears
it from foreign particles, humidifies and also brings the air to body
temperature. Exchange part is the site of actual diffusion of O  and CO

2 2

between blood and atmospheric air.
The lungs are situated in the thoracic chamber which is anatomically

an air-tight chamber. The thoracic chamber is formed dorsally by the
vertebral column, ventrally by the sternum, laterally by the ribs and on
the lower side by the dome-shaped diaphragm. The anatomical setup of
lungs in thorax is such that any change in the volume of the thoracic
cavity will be reflected in the lung (pulmonary) cavity. Such an
arrangement is essential for breathing, as we cannot directly alter the
pulmonary volume.

Respiration involves the following steps:

(i) Breathing or pulmonary ventilation by which atmospheric air
is drawn in and CO  rich alveolar air is released out.

2

(ii) Diffusion of gases (O  and CO ) across alveolar membrane.
2 2

(iii) Transport of gases by the blood.

(iv) Diffusion of O  and CO  between blood and tissues.
2 2

(v) Utilisation of O  by the cells for catabolic reactions and resultant
2

release of CO  (cellular respiration as dealt in the Chapter 12).
2

14.2 MECHANISM OF BREATHING

Breathing involves two stages : inspiration during which atmospheric
air is drawn in and expiration by which the alveolar air is released out.
The movement of air into and out of the lungs is carried out by creating a
pressure gradient between the lungs and the atmosphere. Inspiration
can occur if the pressure within the lungs (intra-pulmonary pressure) is
less than the atmospheric pressure, i.e., there is a negative pressure in
the lungs with respect to atmospheric pressure. Similarly, expiration takes
place when the intra-pulmonary pressure is higher than the atmospheric
pressure. The diaphragm and a specialised set of muscles – external and
internal intercostals between the ribs, help in generation of such gradients.
Inspiration is initiated by the contraction of diaphragm which increases
the volume of thoracic chamber in the antero-posterior axis. The
contraction of external inter-costal muscles lifts up the ribs and the

Reprint 2025-26



186 BIOLOGY

sternum causing an increase in the volume
of the thoracic chamber in the  dorso-ventral
axis. The overall increase in the thoracic
volume causes a similar increase in
pulmonary volume. A n increase in
pulmonary volume decreases the intra-
pulmonary pressure to less than the
atmospheric pressure which forces the air
from outside to move into the lungs, i.e.,
inspiration (Figure 14.2a). Relaxation of the
diaphragm and the inter-costal muscles
returns the diaphragm and sternum to their
normal positions and reduce the thoracic
volume and thereby the pulmonary volume.
This leads to an increase in intra-pulmonary
pressure to slightly above the atmospheric
pressure causing the expulsion of air from
the lungs, i.e., expiration (Figure 14.2b). We
have the ability to increase the strength of
inspiration and expiration with the help of
additional muscles in the abdomen. On an
average, a healthy human breathes 12-16
times/minute. The volume of air involved in
breathing movements can be estimated by
using a spirometer which helps in clinical
assessment of pulmonary functions.

14.2.1 Respiratory Volumes and
Capacities

Tidal Volume (TV): Volume of air inspired or
expired during a normal respiration. It is
approx. 500 mL., i.e., a healthy man can
inspire or expire approximately 6000 to 8000

This averages 2500 mL to 3000 mL.

Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV):
A person can expire by a forcible expiration.
This averages 1000 mL to 1100 mL.

Reprint 2025-26



BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES 187

Residual Volume (RV): Volume of air remaining in the lungs even after a
forcible expiration. This averages 1100 mL to 1200 mL.

By adding up a few respiratory volumes described above, one can
derive various pulmonary capacities, which can be used in clinical
diagnosis.

Inspiratory Capacity (IC): Total volume of air a person can inspire
after a normal expiration. This includes tidal volume and inspiratory
reserve volume ( TV+IRV).

Expiratory Capacity (EC): Total volume of air a person can expire after
a normal inspiration. This includes tidal volume and expiratory reserve
volume (TV+ERV).

Functional Residual Capacity (FRC): Volume of air that will remain in
the lungs after a normal expiration. This includes ERV+RV.

Vital Capacity (VC): The maximum volume of air a person can breathe in
after a forced expiration. This includes ERV, TV and IRV or the maximum
volume of air a person can breathe out after a forced inspiration.

Total Lung Capacity (TLC): Total volume of air accommodated in the
lungs at the end of a forced inspiration. This includes RV, ERV, TV and
IRV or vital capacity + residual volume.

14.3 EXCHANGE OF GASES

Alveoli are the primary sites of exchange of gases. Exchange of gases also
occur between blood and tissues. O  and CO  are exchanged in these

2 2

sites by simple diffusion mainly based on pressure/concentration
gradient. Solubility of the gases as well as the thickness of the membranes
involved in diffusion are also some important factors that can affect the
rate of diffusion.

Pressure contributed by an individual gas in a mixture of gases is
called partial pressure and is represented as pO  for oxygen and pCO  for

2 2

carbon dioxide. Partial pressures of these two gases in the atmospheric
air and the two sites of diffusion are given in Table 14.1 and in
Figure 14.3. The data given in the table clearly indicates a concentration
gradient for oxygen from alveoli to blood and blood to tissues. Similarly,

14.4 TRANSPORT OF GASES

Blood is the medium of transport for O  and CO . About 97 per cent of O  is
2 2 2

transported by RBCs in the blood. The remaining 3 per cent of O  is carried
2

in a dissolved state through the plasma. Nearly 20-25 per cent of CO  is
2

transported by RBCs whereas 70 per cent of it is carried as bicarbonate.
About 7 per cent of CO  is carried in a dissolved state through plasma.

2

14.4.1 Transport of Oxygen

Haemoglobin is a red coloured iron containing pigment present in the
RBCs. O  can bind with haemoglobin in a reversible manner to form

2

oxyhaemoglobin. Each haemoglobin molecule can carry a maximum of
four molecules of O . Binding of oxygen with haemoglobin is primarily

2

related to partial pressure of O . Partial pressure of CO , hydrogen ion
2 2

concentration and temperature are the other factors which can interfere
with this binding. A sigmoid curve is obtained when percentage saturation
of haemoglobin with O  is plotted against the

2

pO . This curve is called the Oxygen
2

dissociation curve (Figure 14.5) and is highly
useful in studying the effect of factors like
pCO , H+ concentration, etc., on binding of O

2 2 100
with haemoglobin. In the alveoli, where there
is high pO , low pCO , lesser H+ concentration

2 2 80
and lower temperature, the factors are
all favourable for the formation of

oxyhaemoglobin, whereas in the tissues,
where low pO , high pCO , high H+

concentration and higher temperature exist,
the conditions are favourable for dissociation

conditions.

CO  is carried by haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobin (about
2

20-25 per cent). This binding is related to the partial pressure of CO .
2

pO  is a major factor which could affect this binding. When pCO  is high
2 2

and pO  is low as in the tissues, more binding of carbon dioxide occurs

whereas, when the pCO  is low and pO  is high as in the alveoli, dissociation

of CO  from carbamino-haemoglobin takes place, i.e., CO  which is bound
2 2

to haemoglobin from the tissues is delivered at the alveoli. RBCs contain
a very high concentration of the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase and minute
quantities of the same is present in the plasma too. This enzyme facilitates
the following reaction in both directions.

At the tissue site where partial pressure of CO  is high due to
2

catabolism, CO  diffuses into blood (RBCs and plasma) and forms HCO –
2 3

and H+,. At the alveolar site where pCO  is low, the reaction proceeds in
2

the opposite direction leading to the formation of CO  and H O. Thus,
2 2

CO  trapped as bicarbonate at the tissue level and transported to the
2

alveoli is released out as CO (Figure 14.4). Every 100 ml of deoxygenated
2 

blood delivers approximately 4 ml of CO  to the alveoli.

14.5 REGULATION OF RESPIRATION

Human beings have a significant ability to maintain and moderate the
respiratory rhythm to suit the demands of the body tissues. This is done
by the neural system. A specialised centre present in the medulla region
of the brain called respiratory rhythm centre is primarily responsible for
this regulation. Another centre present in the pons region of the brain
called pneumotaxic centre can moderate the functions of the respiratory
rhythm centre. Neural signal from this centre can reduce the duration of
inspiration and thereby alter the respiratory rate. A chemosensitive area
is situated adjacent to the rhythm centre which is highly sensitive to CO

2

and hydrogen ions. Increase in these substances can activate this centre,
which in turn can signal the rhythm centre to make necessary adjustments
in the respiratory process by which these substances can be eliminated.
Receptors associated with aortic arch and carotid artery also can recognise
changes in CO  and H+ concentration and send necessary signals to the

2

rhythm centre for remedial actions. The role of oxygen in the regulation of
respiratory rhythm is quite insignificant.

14.6 DISORDERS OF RESPIRATORY SYSTEM

Asthma is a difficulty in breathing causing wheezing due to inflammation
of bronchi and bronchioles.

Emphysema is a chronic disorder in which alveolar walls are damaged
due to which respiratory surface is decreased. One of the major causes of
this is cigarette smoking.

Occupational Respiratory Disorders: In certain industries, especially
those involving grinding or stone-breaking, so much dust is produced
that the defense mechanism of the body cannot fully cope with the
situation. Long exposure can give rise to inflammation leading to fibrosis
(proliferation of fibrous tissues) and thus causing serious lung damage.
Workers in such industries should wear protective masks.

SUMMARY

Cells utilise oxygen for metabolism and produce energy along with substances
like carbon dioxide which is harmful. Animals have evolved different mechanisms
for the transport of oxygen to the cells and for the removal of carbon dioxide from
there. We have a well developed respiratory system comprising two lungs and
associated air passages to perform this function.

The first step in respiration is breathing by which atmospheric air is taken in
(inspiration) and the alveolar air is released out (expiration). Exchange of O  and

2

CO  between deoxygenated blood and alveoli, transport of these gases throughout
2

the body by blood, exchange of O  and CO  between the oxygenated blood and
2 2

tissues and utilisation of O  by the cells (cellular respiration) are the other steps
2

involved.
Inspiration and expiration are carried out by creating pressure gradients

between the atmosphere and the alveoli with the help of specialised muscles –
intercostals and diaphragm. Volumes of air involved in these activities can be
estimated with the help of spirometer and are of clinical significance.

Exchange of O  and CO  at the alveoli and tissues occur by diffusion. Rate of
2 2

diffusion is dependent on the partial pressure gradients of O  (pO ) and CO  (pCO ),
2 2 2 2

their solubility as well as the thickness of the diffusion surface. These factors in
our body facilitate diffusion of O  from the alveoli to the deoxygenated blood as

2

well as from the oxygenated blood to the tissues. The factors are favourable for the
diffusion of CO  in the opposite direction, i.e., from tissues to alveoli.

2

Oxygen is transported mainly as oxyhaemoglobin. In the alveoli where pO  is
2

higher, O  gets bound to haemoglobin which is easily dissociated at the tissues
2

where pO  is low and pCO  and H+ concentration are high. Nearly 70 per cent of
2 2

carbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate (HCO –) with the help of the enzyme
3

carbonic anhydrase. 20-25 per cent of carbon dioxide is carried by haemoglobin
as carbamino-haemoglobin. In the tissues where pCO  is high, it gets bound to

2

blood whereas in the alveoli where pCO is low and pO  is high, it gets removed
2 2

from the blood.
Respiratory rhythm is maintained by the respiratory centre in the medulla

region of brain. A pneumotaxic centre in the pons region of the brain and a
chemosensitive area in the medulla can alter respiratory mechanism.

BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION

15.1 Blood You have learnt that all living cells have to be provided with nutrients, O
2

and other essential substances. Also, the waste or harmful substances
15.2 Lymph (Tissue

produced, have to be removed continuously for healthy functioning of
Fluid)

tissues. It is therefore, essential to have efficient mechanisms for the
15.3 Circulatory movement of these substances to the cells and from the cells. Different

Pathways groups of animals have evolved different methods for this transport. Simple

15.4 Double organisms like sponges and coelenterates circulate water from their

Circulation surroundings through their body cavities to facilitate the cells to exchange
these substances. More complex organisms use special fluids within their

15.5 Regulation of bodies to transport such materials. Blood is the most commonly used body
Cardiac fluid by most of the higher organisms, including humans, for this
Activity purpose. Another body fluid, lymph, also helps in the transport of

15.6 Disorders of certain substances. In this chapter, you will learn about the composition
Circulatory and properties of blood and lymph (tissue fluid) and the mechanism of
System circulation of blood is also explained herein.

15.1 BLOOD

Blood is a special connective tissue consisting of a fluid matrix, plasma,
and formed elements.

15.1.1 Plasma

Plasma is a straw coloured, viscous fluid constituting nearly 55 per cent of
the blood. 90-92 per cent of plasma is water and proteins contribute 6-8
per cent of it. Fibrinogen, globulins and albumins are the major proteins.

Reprint 2025-26



194 BIOLOGY

Fibrinogens are needed for clotting or coagulation of blood. Globulins
primarly are involved in defense mechanisms of the body and the albumins
help in osmotic balance. Plasma also contains small amounts of minerals
like Na+, Ca++, Mg++, HCO –, Cl–, etc. Glucose, amino acids, lipids, etc., are

3

also present in the plasma as they are always in transit in the body. Factors
for coagulation or clotting of blood are also present in the plasma in an
inactive form. Plasma without the clotting factors is called serum.

15.1.2 Formed Elements

Erythrocytes, leucocytes and platelets are collectively called formed
elements (Figure 15.1) and they constitute nearly 45 per cent of the blood.

Erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBC) are the most abundant of all
the cells in blood. A healthy adult man has, on an average, 5 millions to
5.5 millions of RBCs mm–3 of blood. RBCs are formed in the red bone
marrow in the adults. RBCs are devoid of nucleus in most of the mammals
and are biconcave in shape. They have a red coloured, iron containing
complex protein called haemoglobin, hence the colour and name of these
cells. A healthy individual has 12-16 gms of haemoglobin in every
100 ml of blood. These molecules play a significant role in transport of
respiratory gases. RBCs have an average life span of 120 days after which
they are destroyed in the spleen (graveyard of RBCs).

Leucocytes are also known as white blood cells (WBC) as they are
colourless due to the lack of haemoglobin. They are nucleated and are
relatively lesser in number which averages 6000-8000 mm–3 of blood.
Leucocytes are generally short lived. We have two main categories of WBCs
– granulocytes and agranulocytes. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils
are different types of granulocytes, while lymphocytes and monocytes
are the agranulocytes. Neutrophils are the most abundant cells (60-65
per cent) of the total WBCs and basophils are the least (0.5-1 per cent)
among them. Neutrophils and monocytes (6-8 per cent) are phagocytic
cells which destroy foreign organisms entering the body. Basophils secrete
histamine, serotonin, heparin, etc., and are involved in inflammatory
reactions. Eosinophils (2-3 per cent) resist infections and are also

BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 195

associated with allergic reactions. Lymphocytes (20-25 per cent) are of
two major types – ‘B’ and ‘T’ forms. Both B and T lymphocytes are
responsible for immune responses of the body.

Platelets also called thrombocytes, are cell fragments produced from
megakaryocytes (special cells in the bone marrow). Blood normally
contains 1,500,00-3,500,00 platelets mm–3. Platelets can release a variety
of substances most of which are involved in the coagulation or clotting of
blood. A reduction in their number can lead to clotting disorders which
will lead to excessive loss of blood from the body.

15.1.3 Blood Groups

As you know, blood of human beings differ in certain aspects though it
appears to be similar. Various types of grouping of blood has been done.
Two such groupings – the ABO and Rh – are widely used all over the
world.

15.1.3.1 ABO grouping

ABO grouping is based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens
(chemicals that can induce immune response) on the RBCs namely A
and B. Similarly, the plasma of different individuals contain two natural
antibodies (proteins produced in response to antigens). The distribution
of antigens and antibodies in the four groups of blood, A, B, AB and O
are given in Table 15.1. You probably know that during blood transfusion,
any blood cannot be used; the blood of a donor has to be carefully matched
with the blood of a recipient before any blood transfusion to avoid severe
problems of clumping (destruction of RBC). The donor’s compatibility is
also shown in the Table 15.1.

TABLE 15.1  Blood Groups and Donor Compatibility

Blood Group Antigens on Antibodies Donor’s Group
RBCs in Plasma

A A anti-B A, O

B B anti-A B, O

AB A, B nil AB, A, B, O

O nil anti-A, B O

From the above mentioned table it is evident that group ‘O’ blood can
be donated to persons with any other blood group and hence ‘O’ group
individuals are called ‘universal donors’. Persons with ‘AB’ group can
accept blood from persons with AB as well as the other groups of blood.
Therefore, such persons are called ‘universal recipients’.

Reprint 2025-26



196 BIOLOGY

15.1.3.2 Rh grouping

Another antigen, the Rh antigen similar to one present in Rhesus monkeys
(hence Rh), is also observed on the surface of RBCs of majority (nearly 80
per cent) of humans. Such individuals are called Rh positive (Rh+ve)
and those in whom this antigen is absent are called Rh negative (Rh-ve).
An Rh-ve person, if exposed to Rh+ve blood, will form specific antibodies
against the Rh antigens. Therefore, Rh group should also be matched
before transfusions. A special case of Rh incompatibility (mismatching)
has been observed between the Rh-ve blood of a pregnant mother with
Rh+ve blood of the foetus. Rh antigens of the foetus do not get exposed to
the Rh-ve blood of the mother in the first pregnancy as the two bloods are
well separated by the placenta. However, during the delivery of the first
child, there is a possibility of exposure of the maternal blood to small
amounts of the Rh+ve blood from the foetus. In such cases, the mother
starts preparing antibodies against Rh antigen in her blood. In case of
her subsequent pregnancies, the Rh antibodies from the mother (Rh-ve)
can leak into the blood of the foetus (Rh+ve) and destroy the foetal RBCs.
This could be fatal to the foetus or could cause severe anaemia and
jaundice to the baby. This condition is called erythroblastosis foetalis.
This can be avoided by administering anti-Rh antibodies to the mother
immediately after the delivery of the first child.

15.1.4 Coagulation of Blood

You know that when you cut your finger or hurt yourself, your wound
does not continue to bleed for a long time; usually the blood stops flowing
after sometime. Do you know why? Blood exhibits coagulation or clotting
in response to an injury or trauma. This is a mechanism to prevent
excessive loss of blood from the body. You would have observed a dark
reddish brown scum formed at the site of a cut or an injury over a period
of time. It is a clot or coagulam formed mainly of a network of threads
called fibrins in which dead and damaged formed elements of blood are
trapped. Fibrins are formed by the conversion of inactive fibrinogens in
the plasma by the enzyme thrombin. Thrombins, in turn are formed from
another inactive substance present in the plasma called prothrombin. An
enzyme complex, thrombokinase, is required for the above reaction. This
complex is formed by a series of linked enzymic reactions (cascade
process) involving a number of factors present in the plasma in an inactive
state. An injury or a trauma stimulates the platelets in the blood to release
certain factors which activate the mechanism of coagulation. Certain
factors released by the tissues at the site of injury also can initiate
coagulation. Calcium ions play a very important role in clotting.

BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 197

15.2 LYMPH (TISSUE FLUID)

As the blood passes through the capillaries  in tissues, some water along
with many small water soluble substances move out into the spaces
between the cells of tissues leaving the larger proteins and most of the
formed elements in the blood vessels. This fluid released out is called the
interstitial fluid or tissue fluid. It has the same mineral distribution as
that in plasma. Exchange of nutrients, gases, etc., between the blood and
the cells always occur through this fluid. An elaborate network of vessels
called the lymphatic system collects this fluid and drains it back to the
major veins. The fluid present in the lymphatic system is called the lymph.
Lymph is a colourless fluid containing specialised lymphocytes which
are responsible for the immune responses of the body. Lymph is also an
important carrier for nutrients, hormones, etc. Fats are absorbed through
lymph in the lacteals present in the intestinal villi.

15.3 CIRCULATORY PATHWAYS

The circulatory patterns are of two types – open or closed. Open
circulatory system is present in arthropods and molluscs in which blood
pumped by the heart passes through large vessels into open spaces or
body cavities called sinuses. Annelids and chordates have a closed
circulatory system in which the blood pumped by the heart is always
circulated through a closed network of blood vessels. This pattern is
considered to be more advantageous as the flow of fluid can be  more
precisely regulated.

All vertebrates possess a muscular chambered heart. Fishes have a
2-chambered heart with an atrium and a ventricle. Amphibians and the
reptiles (except crocodiles) have a 3-chambered heart with two atria and a
single ventricle, whereas crocodiles, birds and mammals possess a
4-chambered heart with two atria and two ventricles. In fishes the heart
pumps out deoxygenated blood which is oxygenated by the gills and
supplied to the body parts from where deoxygenated blood is returned to
the heart (single circulation). In amphibians and reptiles, the left atrium
receives oxygenated blood from the gills/lungs/skin and the right atrium
gets the deoxygenated blood from other body parts. However, they get mixed
up in the single ventricle which pumps out mixed blood (incomplete double
circulation). In birds and mammals, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood
received by the left and right atria respectively passes on to the ventricles of
the same sides. The ventricles pump it out without any mixing up, i.e., two
separate circulatory pathways are present in these organisms, hence, these
animals have double circulation. Let us study the human circulatory
system.

Reprint 2025-26



198 BIOLOGY

15.3.1 Human Circulatory System

Human circulatory system, also called the blood vascular system consists
of a muscular chambered heart, a network of closed branching blood
vessels and blood, the fluid which is circulated.

Heart, the mesodermally derived organ, is situated in the thoracic
cavity, in between the two lungs, slightly tilted to the left. It has the size of
a clenched fist. It is protected by a double walled membranous bag,
pericardium, enclosing the pericardial fluid. Our heart has four
chambers, two relatively small upper  chambers called atria and two larger
lower chambers called ventricles. A thin, muscular wall called the inter-
atrial septum separates the right and the left atria, whereas a thick-walled,
the inter-ventricular septum, separates the left and the right ventricles
(Figure 15.2). The atrium and the ventricle of the same side are also
separated by a thick fibrous tissue called the atrio-ventricular septum.
However, each of these septa are provided with an opening through which
the two chambers of the  same side are connected. The opening between
the right atrium and the right ventricle is guarded by a valve formed of
three  muscular flaps or cusps, the tricuspid valve, whereas a bicuspid
or mitral valve guards the opening between the left atrium and the left
ventricle. The openings of the right and the left ventricles into the

Figure 15.2 Section of a human heart

BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 199

pulmonary artery and the aorta respectively are provided with the
semilunar valves. The valves in the heart allows the flow of blood only in
one direction, i.e., from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles
to the pulmonary artery or aorta. These valves prevent any backward
flow.

The entire heart is made of cardiac muscles. The walls of ventricles
are much thicker than that of the atria. A specialised cardiac musculature
called the nodal tissue is also distributed in the heart (Figure 15.2). A
patch of this tissue is present in the right upper corner of the right atrium
called the sino-atrial node (SAN). Another mass of this tissue is seen in
the lower left corner of the right atrium close to the atrio-ventricular septum
called the atrio-ventricular node (AVN). A bundle of nodal fibres, atrio-
ventricular bundle (AV bundle) continues from the AVN which passes
through the atrio-ventricular septa to emerge on the top of the inter-
ventricular septum and immediately divides into a right and left bundle.
These branches give rise to minute fibres throughout the ventricular
musculature of the respective sides and are called purkinje fibres.  The
nodal musculature has the ability to generate action potentials without
any external stimuli, i.e., it is autoexcitable. However, the number of action
potentials that could be generated in a minute vary at different parts of
the nodal system. The SAN can generate the maximum number of action
potentials, i.e., 70-75 min–1, and is responsible for initiating and
maintaining the rhythmic contractile activity of the heart. Therefore, it is
called the pacemaker. Our heart normally beats 70-75 times in a minute
(average 72 beats min–1).

15.3.2 Cardiac Cycle

How does the heart function? Let us take a look. To begin with, all the
four chambers of heart are in a relaxed state, i.e., they are in  joint
diastole. As the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are open, blood from the
pulmonary veins and vena cava flows into the left and the right ventricle
respectively through the left and right atria. The semilunar valves are
closed at this stage. The SAN now generates an action potential which
stimulates both the atria to undergo a simultaneous contraction – the
atrial systole. This increases the flow of blood into the ventricles by about
30 per cent. The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by
the AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through
the entire ventricular musculature. This causes the ventricular muscles
to contract,  (ventricular systole), the atria undergoes relaxation
(diastole), coinciding with the ventricular systole. Ventricular systole
increases the ventricular pressure causing the closure of tricuspid and

Reprint 2025-26



200 BIOLOGY

bicuspid valves due to attempted backflow of blood into the atria. As
the ventricular pressure increases further, the semilunar valves guarding
the pulmonary artery (right side) and the aorta (left side) are forced open,
allowing the blood in the ventricles to flow through these vessels into
the circulatory pathways. The ventricles now relax (ventricular diastole)
and the ventricular pressure falls causing the closure of semilunar valves
which prevents the backflow of blood into the ventricles. As the
ventricular pressure declines further, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves
are pushed open by the pressure in the atria exerted by the blood which
was being emptied into them by the veins. The blood now once again
moves freely to the ventricles. The ventricles and atria are now again in
a relaxed (joint diastole) state, as earlier. Soon the SAN generates a new
action potential and the events described above are repeated in that
sequence and the process continues.

This sequential event in the heart which is cyclically repeated is called
the cardiac cycle and it consists of systole and diastole of both the atria
and ventricles. As mentioned earlier, the heart beats 72 times  per minute,
i.e., that many cardiac cycles are performed per minute. From this it could
be deduced that the duration of a cardiac cycle is 0.8 seconds. During a
cardiac cycle, each ventricle pumps out approximately 70 mL of blood
which is called the stroke volume. The stroke volume multiplied by the
heart rate (no. of beats per min.) gives the cardiac output. Therefore, the
cardiac output can be defined as the volume of blood pumped out by each
ventricle per minute and averages 5000 mL or 5 litres in a healthy individual.
The body has the ability to alter the stroke volume as well as the heart rate
and thereby the cardiac output. For example, the cardiac output of an
athlete will be much higher than that of an ordinary man.

During each cardiac cycle two prominent sounds are produced which
can be easily heard through a stethoscope. The first heart sound (lub) is
associated with the closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves whereas
the second heart sound (dub) is associated with the closure of the
semilunar valves. These sounds are of clinical diagnostic significance.

15.3.3 Electrocardiogram (ECG)

You are probably familiar with this scene from a typical hospital television
show: A patient is hooked up to a monitoring machine that shows voltage
traces on a screen and makes the sound “... pip... pip... pip.....
peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee” as the patient goes into cardiac arrest. This type
of machine (electro-cardiograph) is used to obtain an electrocardiogram
(ECG). ECG is a graphical representation of the electrical activity of the
heart during a cardiac cycle. To obtain a standard ECG (as shown in the

Reprint 2025-26



BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 201

Figure 15.3), a patient is connected to the
machine  with three electrical leads (one to each
wrist and to the left ankle) that continuously
monitor the heart activity. For a detailed
evaluation of the heart’s function, multiple
leads are attached to the chest region. Here,
we will talk only about a standard ECG.

Each peak in the ECG is identified with a
letter from P to T that corresponds to a specific Figure 15.3 Diagrammatic presentation of a
electrical activity of the heart. standard ECG

The P-wave represents the electrical
excitation (or depolarisation) of the atria,
which leads to the contraction of both the atria.

The QRS complex represents the depolarisation of the ventricles,
which initiates the ventricular contraction. The contraction starts shortly
after Q and marks the beginning of the systole.

The T-wave represents the return of the ventricles from excited to normal
state (repolarisation). The end of the T-wave marks the end of systole.

Obviously, by counting the number of QRS complexes that occur in a
given time period, one can determine the heart beat rate of an individual.
Since the ECGs obtained from different individuals have roughly the same
shape for a given lead configuration, any deviation from this shape indicates
a possible abnormality or disease. Hence, it is of a great clinical significance.

15.4 DOUBLE CIRCULATION

The blood flows strictly by a fixed route through Blood Vessels—the
arteries and veins. Basically, each artery and vein consists of three layers:
an inner lining of squamous endothelium, the tunica intima, a middle
layer of smooth muscle and elastic fibres, the tunica media, and an
external layer of fibrous connective tissue with collagen fibres, the tunica
externa. The tunica media is comparatively thin in the veins (Figure
15.4).

As mentioned earlier, the blood pumped by the right ventricle enters
the pulmonary artery, whereas the left ventricle pumps blood  into the
aorta. The deoxygenated blood pumped into the pulmonary artery is
passed on to the lungs  from where the oxygenated blood is carried by
the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. This pathway constitutes the
pulmonary circulation. The oxygenated blood entering the aorta is
carried by a network of arteries, arterioles and capillaries to the tissues
from where the deoxygenated blood is collected by a system of venules,
veins and vena cava and emptied into the right atrium. This is the
systemic circulation (Figure 15.4).  The systemic circulation provides
nutrients, O  and other essential substances to the tissues and takes

2

CO  and other harmful substances away for elimination. A unique
2

vascular connection exists between the digestive tract and liver called

Reprint 2025-26



202 BIOLOGY

hepatic portal system. The hepatic portal vein carries blood from intestine
to the liver before it is delivered to the systemic circulation. A special
coronary system of blood vessels is present in our body exclusively for
the circulation of blood to and from the cardiac musculature.

Figure 15.4 Schematic plan of blood circulation in human

15.5 REGULATION OF CARDIAC ACTIVITY

Normal activities of the heart are regulated intrinsically, i.e., auto regulated
by specialised muscles (nodal tissue), hence the heart is called myogenic.
A special neural centre in the medulla oblangata can moderate the cardiac
function through autonomic nervous system (ANS). Neural signals through
the sympathetic nerves (part of ANS) can increase the rate of heart beat,
the strength of ventricular contraction and thereby the cardiac output.
On the other hand, parasympathetic neural signals (another component
of ANS) decrease the rate of heart beat, speed of conduction of action
potential and thereby the cardiac output. Adrenal medullary hormones
can also increase the cardiac output.

15.6 DISORDERS OF CIRCULATORY SYSTEM

High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): Hypertension is the term for
blood pressure that is higher than normal (120/80). In this measurement
120 mm Hg (millimetres of mercury pressure) is the systolic, or pumping,
pressure and  80 mm Hg is the diastolic, or resting, pressure. If repeated
checks of blood pressure of an individual is 140/90 (140 over 90) or

Reprint 2025-26



BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 203

higher, it shows hypertension. High blood pressure leads to heart diseases
and also affects vital organs like brain and kidney.

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Coronary Artery Disease, often referred
to as atherosclerosis, affects the vessels that supply blood to the heart
muscle. It is caused by deposits of calcium, fat, cholesterol and fibrous
tissues, which makes the lumen of arteries narrower.

Angina: It is also called ‘angina pectoris’. A symptom of acute chest pain
appears when no enough oxygen is reaching the heart muscle. Angina
can occur in men and women of any age but it is more common among
the middle-aged and elderly. It occurs due to conditions that affect the
blood flow.

Heart Failure: Heart failure means the state of heart when it is not pumping
blood effectively enough to meet the needs of the body. It is sometimes
called congestive heart failure because congestion of the lungs is one of
the main symptoms of this disease. Heart failure is not the same as cardiac
arrest (when the heart stops beating) or a heart attack (when the heart
muscle is suddenly damaged by an inadequate blood supply).

SUMMARY

Vertebrates circulate blood, a fluid connective tissue, in their body, to transport essential
substances to the cells and to carry waste substances from there. Another fluid, lymph
(tissue fluid) is also used for the transport of certain substances.

Blood comprises of a fluid matrix, plasma and formed elements. Red blood cells (RBCs,
erythrocytes), white blood cells (WBCs, leucocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes) constitute
the formed elements. Blood of humans are grouped into A, B, AB and O systems based
on the presence or absence of two surface antigens, A, B on the RBCs. Another blood
grouping is also done based on the presence or absence of another antigen called Rhesus
factor (Rh) on the surface of RBCs. The spaces between cells in the tissues contain a fluid
derived from blood called tissue fluid. This fluid called lymph is almost similar to blood
except for the protein content and the formed elements.

All vertebrates and a few invertebrates have a closed circulatory system. Our circulatory
system consists of a muscular pumping organ, heart, a network of vessels and a fluid, blood.
Heart has two atria and two ventricles. Cardiac musculature is auto-excitable. Sino-atrial node
(SAN) generates the maximum number of action protentials per minute (70-75/min) and
therefore, it sets the pace of the activities of the heart. Hence it is called the Pacemaker. The
action potential causes the atria and then the ventricles to undergo contraction (systole) followed
by their relaxation (diastole). The systole forces the blood to move from the atria to the ventricles
and to the pulmonary artery and the aorta. The cardiac cycle is formed by sequential events in
the heart which is cyclically repeated and is called the cardiac cycle. A healthy person shows 72
such cycles per minute. About 70 mL of blood is pumped out by each ventricle during a
cardiac cycle and it is called the stroke or beat volume. Volume of blood pumped out by each
ventricle of heart per minute is called the cardiac output and it is equal to the product of stroke
volume and heart rate (approx 5 litres). The electrical activity of the heart can be recorded from

204 BIOLOGY

the body surface by using electrocardiograph and the recording is called
electrocardiogram (ECG) which is of clinical importance.

We have a complete double circulation, i.e., two circulatory pathways, namely,
pulmonary and systemic are present. The pulmonary circulation starts by the
pumping of deoxygenated blood by the right ventricle which is carried to the lungs
where it is oxygenated and returned to the left atrium. The systemic circulation
starts with the pumping of oxygenated blood by the left ventricle to the aorta
which is carried to all the body tissues and the deoxygenated blood from there is
collected by the veins and returned to the right atrium. Though the heart is
autoexcitable, its functions can be moderated by neural and hormonal mechanisms.

A survey of animal kingdom presents a variety of excretory structures.
In most of the invertebrates, these structures  are simple tubular forms
whereas vertebrates have complex tubular organs called kidneys. Some
of these structures are mentioned here. Protonephridia or flame cells are
the excretory structures in Platyhelminthes (Flatworms, e.g., Planaria),
rotifers, some annelids and the cephalochordate – Amphioxus.
Protonephridia are primarily concerned with ionic and fluid volume
regulation, i.e., osmoregulation. Nephridia are the tubular excretory
structures of earthworms and other annelids. Nephridia help to remove
nitrogenous wastes and maintain a fluid and ionic balance. Malpighian
tubules are the excretory structures of most of the insects including
cockroaches. Malpighian tubules help in the removal of nitrogenous
wastes and osmoregulation. Antennal glands or green glands perform
the excretory function in crustaceans like prawns.

16.1 HUMAN EXCRETORY SYSTEM

In humans, the excretory system consists
of a pair of kidneys, one pair of ureters, a
urinary bladder and a urethra (Figure
16.1). Kidneys are reddish brown, bean
shaped structures situated between the
levels of last thoracic and third lumbar
vertebra close to the dorsal inner wall of
the abdominal cavity. Each kidney of an
adult human measures 10-12 cm in
length, 5-7 cm in width, 2-3 cm in
thickness with an average weight of 120-
170 g. Towards the centre of the inner
concave surface of the kidney is a notch
called hilum through which ureter, blood
vessels and nerves enter. Inner to the hilum
is a broad funnel shaped space called the
renal pelvis with projections called calyces.
The outer layer of kidney is a tough
capsule. Inside the kidney, there are two
zones, an outer cortex and an inner

Figure 16.1 Human Urinary system medulla. The medulla is divided into a few
conical masses (medullary pyramids)
projecting into the calyces (sing.: calyx).
The cortex extends in between the

medullary pyramids as renal columns called
Columns of Bertini (Figure 16.2).

Each kidney has nearly one million
complex tubular structures called nephrons
(Figure 16.3), which are the functional units.
Each nephron has two parts – the
glomerulus and the renal tubule.
Glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries formed by
the afferent arteriole – a fine branch of renal
artery. Blood from the glomerulus is carried
away by an efferent arteriole.

The renal tubule begins with a double
walled cup-like structure called Bowman’s
capsule, which encloses the glomerulus.
Glomerulus alongwith Bowman’s capsule, is
called the malpighian body or renal Figure 16.2 Longitudinal section (Diagrammatic)
corpuscle  (Figure 16.4). The tubule of Kidney

network – proximal convoluted tubule

Afferent arteriole (PCT). A hairpin shaped Henle’s loop is
the next part of the tubule which has a

Efferent descending and an ascending limb. The
arteriole ascending limb continues as another highly

coiled tubular region called distal
Bowman’s convoluted tubule (DCT). The DCTs of
capsule

many nephrons open into a straight tube
called collecting duct, many of which
converge and open into the renal pelvis
through medullary pyramids in the
calyces.

The Malpighian corpuscle, PCT and
DCT of the nephron are situated in the
cortical region of the kidney whereas the

Proximal loop of Henle dips into the medulla. In
convoluted tubule majority of nephrons, the loop of Henle is

too short and extends only very little into
Figure 16.4 Malpighian body (renal corpuscle) the medulla. Such nephrons are called

cortical nephrons. In some of the nephrons,
the loop of Henle is very long and runs deep into the medulla. These
nephrons are called juxta medullary nephrons.

The efferent arteriole emerging from the glomerulus forms a fine
capillary network around the renal tubule called the peritubular
capillaries. A minute vessel of this network runs parallel to the Henle’s
loop forming a ‘U’ shaped vasa recta.  Vasa recta is absent or highly
reduced in cortical nephrons.

16.2 URINE FORMATION

Urine formation involves three main processes namely, glomerular
filtration, reabsorption and secretion, that takes place in different parts of
the nephron.

The first step in urine formation is the filtration of blood, which is carried
out by the glomerulus and is called glomerular filtration. On an average,
1100-1200 ml of blood is filtered by the kidneys per minute which constitute
roughly 1/5th of the blood pumped out by each ventricle of the heart in a
minute. The glomerular capillary blood pressure causes filtration of blood
through 3 layers, i.e., the endothelium of glomerular blood vessels, the
epithelium of Bowman’s capsule and a basement membrane between these
two layers. The epithelial cells of Bowman’s capsule called podocytes are
arranged in an intricate manner so as to leave some minute spaces called
filtration slits or slit pores. Blood is filtered so finely through these
membranes, that almost all the constituents of the plasma except the
proteins pass onto the lumen of the Bowman’s capsule. Therefore, it is
considered as a process of ultra filtration.

Reprint 2025-26



EXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION 209

The amount of the filtrate formed by the kidneys per minute is called
glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR in a healthy individual is
approximately 125 ml/minute, i.e., 180 litres per day !

The kidneys have built-in mechanisms for the regulation of glomerular
filtration rate. One such efficient mechanism is carried out by juxta
glomerular apparatus (JGA). JGA is a special sensitive region formed by
cellular modifications in the distal convoluted tubule and the afferent
arteriole at the location of their contact. A fall in GFR can activate the JG
cells to release renin which can stimulate the glomerular blood flow and
thereby the GFR back to normal.

A comparison of the volume of the filtrate formed per day (180 litres
per day) with that of the urine released (1.5 litres), suggest that nearly 99
per cent of the filtrate has to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. This
process is called reabsorption. The tubular epithelial cells in different
segments of nephron perform this either by active or passive mechanisms.
For example, substances like glucose, amino acids, Na+, etc., in the filtrate
are reabsorbed actively whereas the nitrogenous wastes are absorbed by
passive transport. Reabsorption of water also occurs passively in the initial
segments of the nephron (Figure 16.5).

During urine formation, the tubular cells secrete substances like H+,
K+ and ammonia into the filtrate. Tubular secretion is also an important
step in urine formation as it helps in the maintenance of ionic and acid
base balance of body fluids.

16.3 FUNCTION OF THE TUBULES

Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): PCT is lined by simple cuboidal
brush border epithelium which increases the surface area for reabsorption.
Nearly all of the essential nutrients, and 70-80 per cent of electrolytes
and water are reabsorbed by this segment. PCT also helps to maintain
the pH and ionic balance of the body fluids by selective secretion of
hydrogen ions and ammonia into the filtrate and by absorption of
HCO – from it.

3

Henle’s Loop: Reabsorption is minimum in its ascending limb.
However, this region plays a significant role in the maintenance of high
osmolarity of medullary interstitial fluid. The descending limb of loop of
Henle is permeable to water but almost impermeable to electrolytes. This
concentrates the filtrate as it moves down. The ascending limb is
impermeable to water but allows transport of electrolytes actively or
passively. Therefore, as the concentrated filtrate pass upward, it gets
diluted due to the passage of electrolytes to the medullary fluid.

Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT): Conditional reabsorption of Na+

and water takes place in this segment. DCT is also capable of reabsorption
of HCO – and selective secretion of hydrogen and potassium ions and

3

210 BIOLOGY

Figure 16.5 Reabsorption and secretion of major substances at different parts of
the nephron (Arrows indicate direction of movement of materials.)

Collecting Duct: This long duct extends from the cortex of the kidney
to the inner parts of the medulla. Large amounts of water could be
reabsorbed from this region to produce a concentrated urine. This segment
allows passage of small amounts of urea into the medullary interstitium
to keep up the osmolarity. It also plays a role in the maintenance of pH
and ionic balance of blood by the selective secretion of H+ and K+ ions
(Figure 16.5).

16.4 MECHANISM OF CONCENTRATION OF THE FILTRATE

Mammals have the ability to produce a concentrated urine. The Henle’s
loop and vasa recta play a significant role in this. The flow of filtrate in
the two limbs of Henle’s loop is in opposite directions and thus forms a
counter current. The flow of blood through the two limbs of vasa recta is

Reprint 2025-26



EXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION 211

also in a counter current pattern. The proximity between the Henle’s loop
and vasa recta, as well as the counter current in them help in maintaining
an increasing osmolarity towards the inner medullary interstitium, i.e.,
from 300 mOsmolL–1 in the cortex to about 1200 mOsmolL–1 in the inner
medulla. This gradient is mainly caused by NaCl and urea. NaCl is
transported by the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is exchanged
with the descending limb of vasa recta. NaCl is returned to the interstitium
by the ascending portion of vasa recta. Similarly, small amounts of urea
enter the thin segment of the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is
transported back to the interstitium by the collecting tubule. The above
described transport of substances facilitated by the special arrangement
of Henle’s loop and vasa recta is called the counter current mechanism
(Figure. 16.6). This mechanism helps to maintain a concentration gradient

Figure 16.6 Diagrammatic representation of a nephron and vasa recta showing
counter current mechanisms

Reprint 2025-26



212 BIOLOGY

in the medullary interstitium. Presence of such interstitial gradient helps
in an easy passage of water from the collecting tubule thereby
concentrating the filtrate (urine). Human kidneys can produce urine nearly
four times concentrated than the initial filtrate formed.

16.5 REGULATION OF KIDNEY FUNCTION

The functioning of the kidneys is efficiently monitored and regulated by
hormonal feedback mechanisms involving the hypothalamus, JGA and
to a certain extent, the heart.

Osmoreceptors in the body are activated by changes in blood volume,
body fluid volume and ionic concentration. An excessive loss of fluid from
the body can activate these receptors which stimulate the hypothalamus
to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin from the
neurohypophysis. ADH facilitates water reabsorption from latter parts of
the tubule, thereby preventing diuresis. An increase in body fluid volume
can switch off the osmoreceptors and suppress the ADH release to complete
the feedback. ADH can also affect the kidney function by its constrictory
effects on blood vessels. This causes an increase in blood pressure. An
increase in blood pressure can increase the glomerular blood flow and
thereby the GFR.

The JGA plays a complex regulatory role. A fall in glomerular blood
flow/glomerular blood pressure/GFR can activate the JG cells to release
renin which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I and
further to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, being a powerful
vasoconstrictor, increases the glomerular blood pressure and thereby
GFR. Angiotensin II also activates the adrenal cortex to release
Aldosterone. Aldosterone causes reabsorption of Na+ and water from
the distal parts of the tubule. This also leads to an increase in blood
pressure and GFR. This complex mechanism is generally known as
the Renin-Angiotensin mechanism.

An increase in blood flow to the atria of the heart can cause the release
of Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF). ANF can cause vasodilation (dilation of
blood vessels) and thereby decrease the blood pressure. ANF mechanism,
therefore, acts as a check on the renin-angiotensin mechanism.

16.6 MICTURITION

Urine formed by the nephrons is ultimately carried to the urinary bladder
where it is stored till a voluntary signal is given by the central nervous
system (CNS). This signal is initiated by the stretching of the urinary bladder
as it gets filled with urine. In response, the stretch receptors on the walls
of the bladder send signals to the CNS. The CNS passes on motor messages

Reprint 2025-26



EXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION 213

to initiate the contraction of smooth muscles of the bladder and
simultaneous relaxation of the urethral sphincter causing the release of
urine. The process of release of urine is called micturition and the neural
mechanisms causing it is called the micturition reflex. An adult human
excretes, on an average, 1 to 1.5 litres of urine per day. The urine formed
is a light yellow coloured watery fluid which is slightly acidic (pH-6.0)
and has a characterestic odour. On an average, 25-30 gm of urea is
excreted out per day. Various conditions can affect the characteristics of
urine. Analysis of urine helps in clinical diagnosis of many metabolic
discorders as well as malfunctioning of the kidney. For example, presence
of glucose (Glycosuria) and ketone bodies (Ketonuria) in urine are
indicative of diabetes mellitus.

16.7 ROLE OF OTHER ORGANS IN EXCRETION

Other than the kidneys, lungs, liver and skin also help in the elimination
of excretory wastes.

Our lungs remove large amounts of CO  (approximately 200mL/
2

minute) and also significant quantities of water every day. Liver, the largest
gland in our body, secretes bile-containing substances like bilirubin,
biliverdin, cholesterol, degraded steroid hormones, vitamins and drugs.
Most of these substances ultimately pass out along with digestive wastes.

The sweat and sebaceous glands in the skin can eliminate certain
substances through their secretions. Sweat produced by the sweat
glands is a watery fluid containing NaCl, small amounts of urea, lactic
acid, etc. Though the primary function of sweat is to facilitate a cooling
effect on the body surface, it also helps in the removal of some of the
wastes mentioned above. Sebaceous glands eliminate certain
substances like sterols, hydrocarbons and waxes through sebum. This
secretion provides a protective oily covering for the skin. Do you know
that small amounts of nitrogenous wastes could be eliminated through
saliva too?

16.8 DISORDERS OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM

Malfunctioning of kidneys can lead to accumulation of urea in blood, a
condition called uremia, which is highly harmful and may lead to kidney
failure. In such patients, urea can be removed by a process called
hemodialysis. During the process of haemodialysis, the blood drained
from a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysing unit called artificial
kidney. Blood drained from a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysing
unit after adding an anticoagulant like heparin. The unit contains a coiled
cellophane tube surrounded by a fluid (dialysing fluid) having the same

Reprint 2025-26



214 BIOLOGY

composition as that of plasma except the nitrogenous wastes. The porous
cellophane membrance of the tube allows the passage of molecules based
on concentration gradient. As nitrogenous wastes are absent in the
dialysing fluid, these substances freely move out, thereby clearing the
blood. The cleared blood is pumped back to the body through a vein
after adding anti-heparin to it. This method is a boon for thousands of
uremic patients all over the world.

Kidney transplantation is the ultimate method in the correction of
acute renal failures (kidney failure). A functioning kidney is used in
transplantation from a donor, preferably a close relative, to minimise its
chances of rejection by the immune system of the host. Modern clinical
procedures have increased the success rate of such a complicated
technique.

Renal calculi: Stone or insoluble mass of crystallised salts (oxalates,
etc.) formed within the kidney.

Glomerulonephritis: Inflammation of glomeruli of kidney.

SUMMARY

Many nitrogen containing substances, ions, CO , water, etc., that accumulate in
2

the body have to be eliminated. Nature of nitrogenous wastes formed and their
excretion vary among animals, mainly depending on the habitat (availability of
water). Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the major nitrogenous wastes excreted.

Protonephridia, nephridia, malpighian tubules, green glands and the kidneys are
the common excretory organs in animals. They not only eliminate nitrogenous wastes
but also help in the maintenance of ionic and acid-base balance of body fluids.

In humans, the excretory system consists of one pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters,
a urinary bladder and a urethra. Each kidney has over a million tubular structures
called nephrons. Nephron is the functional unit of kidney and has two portions –
glomerulus and renal tubule. Glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries formed from afferent
arterioles, fine branches of renal artery. The renal tubule starts with a double walled
Bowman’s capsule and is further differentiated into a proximal convoluted tubule
(PCT), Henle’s loop (HL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The DCTs of many
nephrons join to a common collecting duct many of which ultimately open into the
renal pelvis through the medullary pyramids. The Bowman’s capsule encloses the
glomerulus to form Malpighian or renal corpuscle.

Urine formation involves three main processes, i.e., filtration, reabsorption and
secretion. Filtration is a non-selective process performed by the glomerulus using
the glomerular capillary blood pressure. About 1200 ml of blood is filtered by the
glomerulus per minute to form 125 ml of filtrate in the Bowman’s capsule per

Reprint 2025-26



EXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION 215

minute (GFR). JGA, a specialised portion of the nephrons, plays a significant role
in the regulation of GFR. Nearly 99 per cent reabsorption of the filtrate takes place
through different parts of the nephrons. PCT is the major site of reabsorption and
selective secretion. HL primarily helps to maintain osmolar gradient
(300 mOsmolL–1 -1200 mOsmolL–1) within the kidney interstitium. DCT and
collecting duct allow extensive reabsorption of water and certain electrolytes, which
help in osmoregulation: H+, K+ and NH  could be secreted into the filtrate by the

3

tubules to maintain the ionic balance and pH of body fluids.
A counter current mechanism operates between the two limbs of the loop of

Henle and those of vasa recta (capillary parallel to Henle’s loop). The filtrate gets
concentrated as it moves down the descending limb but is diluted by the ascending
limb. Electrolytes and urea are retained in the interstitium by this arrangement.
DCT and collecting duct concentrate the filtrate about four times, i.e., from 300
mOsmolL–1 to 1200 mOsmolL–1, an excellent mechanism of conservation of water.
Urine is stored in the urinary bladder till a voluntary signal from CNS carries out
its release through urethra, i.e., micturition. Skin, lungs and liver also assist in
excretion.

food through cytopharynx and in locomotion as well. Hydra can use its
tentacles for capturing its prey and also use them for locomotion. We use
limbs for changes in body postures and locomotion as well. The above
observations suggest that movements and locomotion cannot be studied
separately. The two may be linked by stating that all locomotions are
movements but all movements are not locomotions.

Methods of locomotion performed by animals vary with their habitats
and the demand of the situation. However, locomotion is generally for
search of food, shelter, mate, suitable breeding grounds, favourable
climatic conditions or to escape from enemies/predators.

17.1 TYPES OF MOVEMENT

Cells of the human body exhibit three main types of movements, namely,
amoeboid, ciliary and muscular.

Reprint 2025-26



218 BIOLOGY

Some specialised cells in our body like macrophages and leucocytes
in blood exhibit amoeboid movement. It is effected by pseudopodia formed
by the streaming of protoplasm (as in Amoeba). Cytoskeletal elements
like microfilaments are also involved in amoeboid movement.

Ciliary movement occurs in most of our internal tubular organs which
are lined by  ciliated epithelium. The coordinated movements of cilia in
the trachea help us in removing dust particles and some of the foreign
substances inhaled along with the atmospheric air. Passage of ova through
the female reproductive tract is also facilitated by the ciliary movement.

Movement of our limbs, jaws, tongue, etc, require muscular
movement. The contractile property of muscles are effectively used for
locomotion and other movements by human beings and majority of
multicellular organisms. Locomotion requires a perfect coordinated
activity of muscular, skeletal and neural systems. In this chapter, you
will learn about the types of muscles, their structure, mechanism of
their contraction and important aspects of the skeletal system.

17.2 MUSCLE

You have studied in Chapter 8 that the cilia and flagella are the outgrowths
of the cell membrane. Flagellar movement helps in the swimming of
spermatozoa, maintenance of water current in the canal system of sponges
and in locomotion of Protists like Euglena. Muscle is a specialised
tissue of mesodermal origin. About 40-50 per cent of the body
weight of a human adult is contributed by muscles. They have
special properties like excitability, contractility, extensibility and
elasticity. Muscles have been classified using different criteria,
namely location, appearance and nature of regulation of their
activities. Based on their location, three types of muscles are
identified : (i) Skeletal (ii) Visceral and (iii) Cardiac.

Skeletal muscles are closely associated with the skeletal components
of the body. They have a striped appearance under the microscope and
hence are called striated muscles. As their activities are under the
voluntary control of the nervous system, they are known as voluntary
muscles too. They are primarily involved in locomotory actions and
changes of body postures.

Visceral muscles are located in the inner walls of hollow visceral organs
of the body like the alimentary canal, reproductive tract, etc. They do not
exhibit any striation and are smooth in appearance. Hence, they are called
smooth muscles (nonstriated muscle). Their activities are not under the
voluntary control of the nervous system and are therefore known as
involuntary muscles. They assist, for example, in the transportation of food
through the digestive tract and gametes through the genital tract.

LOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 219

As the name suggests, Cardiac muscles are the muscles of heart.
Many cardiac muscle cells assemble in a branching pattern to form a
cardiac muscle. Based on appearance, cardiac muscles are striated. They
are involuntary in nature as the nervous system does not control their
activities directly.

Let us examine a skeletal muscle in detail to understand the structure
and mechanism of contraction. Each organised skeletal muscle in our
body is made of a number of muscle bundles or fascicles held together
by a common collagenous connective tissue layer called fascia. Each
muscle bundle  contains a number of muscle fibres (Figure 17.1). Each

muscle fibre is lined by the plasma membrane called sarcolemma
enclosing the sarcoplasm. Muscle fibre is a syncitium as the sarcoplasm
contains many nuclei. The endoplasmic reticulum, i.e., sarcoplasmic
reticulum of the muscle fibres is the store house of calcium ions. A
characteristic feature of the muscle fibre is the presence of a large number
of parallelly arranged filaments in the sarcoplasm called myofilaments or
myofibrils. Each myofibril has alternate dark and light bands on it. A
detailed study of the myofibril has established that the striated appearance
is due to the distribution pattern of two important proteins – Actin and
Myosin. The light bands contain actin and is called I-band or Isotropic
band, whereas the dark band called ‘A’ or Anisotropic band contains

myosin. Both the proteins are arranged as rod-like structures, parallel to
each other and also to the longitudinal axis of the myofibrils. Actin
filaments are thinner as compared to the myosin filaments, hence are
commonly called thin and thick filaments respectively. In the centre of
each ‘I’ band is an elastic fibre called ‘Z’ line which bisects it. The thin
filaments are firmly attached to the ‘Z’ line. The thick filaments in the
‘A’ band are also held together in the middle of this band by a thin fibrous
membrane called ‘M’ line. The ‘A’ and ‘I’ bands are arranged alternately
throughout the length of the myofibrils. The portion of the myofibril
between two successive ‘Z’ lines is considered as the functional unit of
contraction and is called a sarcomere (Figure 17.2). In a resting state, the
edges of thin filaments on either side of the thick filaments partially overlap
the free ends of the thick filaments leaving the central part of the thick
filaments. This central part of thick filament, not overlapped by thin
filaments is called the ‘H’ zone.

17.2.1 Structure of Contractile Proteins

Each actin (thin) filament is made of two ‘F’ (filamentous) actins
helically wound to each other. Each ‘F’ actin is a polymer of monomeric
‘G’ (Globular) actins. Two filaments of another protein, tropomyosin
also run close to the ‘F’ actins throughout its length. A complex protein
Troponin is distributed at regular intervals on the tropomyosin. In the
resting state a subunit of troponin masks the active binding sites for
myosin on the actin filaments (Figure 17.3a).

Each myosin (thick) filament is also a polymerised protein. Many
monomeric proteins called Meromyosins (Figure 17.3b) constitute one
thick filament. Each meromyosin has two important parts, a globular
head with a short arm and a tail, the former being called the heavy
meromyosin (HMM) and the latter, the light meromyosin (LMM). The HMM
component, i.e.; the head and short arm projects outwards at regular
distance and angle from each other from the surface of a polymerised myosin
filament and is known as cross arm. The globular head is an active ATPase
enzyme and has binding sites for ATP and active sites for actin.

17.2.2 Mechanism of Muscle Contraction

Mechanism of muscle contraction is best explained by the sliding filament
theory which states that contraction of a muscle fibre takes place by the
sliding of the thin filaments over the thick filaments.

Muscle contraction is initiated by a signal sent by the central nervous
system (CNS) via a motor neuron. A motor neuron along with the muscle
fibres connected to it constitute a motor unit. The junction between a
motor neuron and the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre is called the
neuromuscular junction or motor-end plate. A neural signal reaching this
junction releases a neurotransmitter (Acetyl choline) which generates an
action potential in the sarcolemma. This spreads through the muscle fibre
and causes the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase in
Ca++ level leads to the binding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on
actin filaments and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin.
Utilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head now binds to
the exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge (Figure 17.4).

cross bridge

This pulls the attached actin filaments towards the centre of ‘A’ band. The
‘Z’ line attached to these actins are also pulled inwards thereby causing a
shortening of the sarcomere, i.e., contraction. It is clear from the above
steps, that during shortening of the muscle, i.e., contraction, the ‘I’ bands
get reduced, whereas the ‘A’ bands retain the length (Figure 17.5). The
myosin, releasing the ADP and P  goes back to its relaxed state. A new

and breakage is repeated causing further sliding. The process continues
till the Ca++ ions are pumped back to the sarcoplasmic cisternae resulting
in the masking of actin filaments. This causes the return of ‘Z’ lines back
to their original position, i.e., relaxation. The reaction time of the fibres
can vary in different muscles. Repeated activation of the muscles can lead
to the accumulation of lactic acid due to anaerobic breakdown of glycogen
in them, causing fatigue. Muscle contains a red coloured oxygen storing
pigment called myoglobin. Myoglobin content is high in some of the
muscles which gives a reddish appearance. Such muscles are called the
Red fibres. These muscles also contain plenty of mitochondria which can
utilise the large amount of oxygen stored in them for ATP production.
These muscles, therefore, can also be called aerobic muscles. On the
other hand, some of the muscles possess very less quantity of myoglobin
and therefore, appear pale or whitish. These are the White fibres. Number
of mitochondria are also few in them, but the amount of sarcoplasmic
reticulum is high. They depend on anaerobic process for energy.

17.3 SKELETAL SYSTEM

Skeletal system consists of a framework of bones and a few cartilages.
This system has a significant role in movement shown by the body.
Imagine chewing food without  jaw bones and walking around without
the limb bones. Bone and cartilage are specialised connective tissues.
The former has a very hard matrix due to calcium salts in it and the latter
has slightly pliable matrix due to chondroitin salts. In human beings,
this system is made up of 206 bones and a few cartilages. It is grouped
into two principal divisions – the axial and the appendicular skeleton.

Axial skeleton comprises 80 bones distributed along the main
axis of the body. The skull, vertebral column, sternum and ribs
constitute axial skeleton. The skull (Figure 17.6) is composed of two

sets of bones – cranial and facial, that totals to 22 bones. Cranial bones
are 8 in number. They form the hard protective outer covering, cranium
for the brain. The facial region is made up of 14 skeletal elements which
form the front part of the skull. A single U-shaped bone called hyoid is
present at the base of the buccal cavity. Each middle ear contains three
tiny bones – Malleus, Incus and Stapes, collectively called Ear
Ossicles. The skull region articulates with the superior region of the

vertebral column with the help of two occipital Cervical vertebra
condyles (dicondylic skull).

Our vertebral column (Figure 17.7) is
formed by 26 serially arranged units called
vertebrae and is dorsally placed. It extends from
the base of the skull and constitutes the main
framework of the trunk. Each vertebra has a Thoracic

vertebra
central hollow portion (neural canal) through
which the spinal cord passes. First vertebra is
the atlas and it articulates with the occipital
condyles. The vertebral column is differentiated
into cervical (7), thoracic (12), lumbar (5), sacral Intervertebral Lumbar
(1-fused) and coccygeal (1-fused) regions disc vertebra

starting from the skull. The number of cervical
vertebrae are seven in almost all mammals Sacrum

including human beings. The vertebral column
protects the spinal cord, supports the head and Coccyx
serves as the point of attachment for the ribs
and musculature of the back. Sternum is a Figure 17.7  Vertebral column (right lateral view)
flat bone on the ventral midline of thorax.

There are 12 pairs of ribs. Each rib is a
thin flat bone connected dorsally to the
vertebral column and ventrally to the sternum.
It has two articulation surfaces on its dorsal
end and is hence called bicephalic. First
seven pairs of ribs are called true ribs.
Dorsally, they are attached to the thoracic
vertebrae and ventrally connected to the
sternum with the help of hyaline cartilage.
The 8th, 9th and 10th pairs of ribs do not
articulate directly with the sternum but join
the seventh rib with the help of hyaline
cartilage. These are called vertebrochondral
(false) ribs. Last 2 pairs (11th and 12th) of
ribs are not connected ventrally and are
therefore, called floating ribs. Thoracic
vertebrae, ribs and sternum together form
the rib cage (Figure 17.8).

The bones of the limbs along with their
girdles constitute the appendicular
skeleton. Each limb is made of 30 bones. Figure 17.8  Ribs and rib cage

The bones of the hand (fore limb) are

humerus, radius and ulna, carpals (wrist bones
– 8 in number), metacarpals (palm bones – 5
in number) and phalanges (digits – 14 in
number) (Figure 17.9). Femur (thigh bone –
the longest bone), tibia and fibula, tarsals (ankle
bones – 7 in number), metatarsals (5 in
number) and phalanges (digits – 14 in number)
are the bones of the legs (hind limb) (Figure
17.10). A cup shaped bone called patella cover
the knee ventrally (knee cap).

Pectoral and Pelvic girdle bones help in
the articulation of the upper and the lower limbs
respectively with the axial skeleton. Each
girdle is formed of two halves. Each half of
pectoral girdle consists of a clavicle and a
scapula (Figure 17.9). Scapula is a large
triangular flat bone situated in the dorsal part
of the thorax between the second and the
seventh ribs. The dorsal, flat, triangular body
of scapula has a slightly elevated ridge called

process called the acromion. The clavicle
articulates with this. Below the acromion is a
depression called the glenoid cavity which
articulates with the head of the humerus to
form the shoulder joint. Each clavicle is a long
slender bone with two curvatures. This bone
is commonly called the collar bone.

Pelvic girdle consists of two coxal bones
(Figure 17.10). Each coxal bone is formed by
the fusion of three bones – ilium, ischium and
pubis. At the point of fusion of the above bones
is a cavity called acetabulum to which the thigh
bone articulates. The two halves of the pelvic
girdle meet ventrally to form the pubic
symphysis containing fibrous cartilage.

this. Joints are points of contact between bones, or between bones and
cartilages. Force generated by the muscles is used to carry out movement
through joints, where the joint acts as a fulcrum. The movability at these
joints vary depending on different factors. Joints have been classified into
three major structural forms, namely, fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial.

Fibrous joints do not allow any movement. This type of joint is shown
by the flat skull bones which fuse end-to-end with the help of dense fibrous
connective tissues in the form of sutures, to form the cranium.

In cartilaginous joints, the bones involved are joined together with
the help of cartilages. The joint between the adjacent vertebrae in the
vertebral column is of this pattern and it permits limited movements.

Synovial joints are characterised by the presence of a fluid filled synovial
cavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bones. Such an arragement
allows considerable movement. These joints help in locomotion and many
other movements. Ball and socket joint (between humerus and pectoral
girdle), hinge joint (knee joint), pivot joint (between atlas and axis), gliding
joint (between the carpals) and saddle joint (between carpal and metacarpal
of thumb) are some examples.

17.5 DISORDERS OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEM

Myasthenia gravis: Auto immune disorder affecting neuromuscular
junction leading to fatigue, weakening and paralysis of skeletal muscle.

Muscular dystrophy: Progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle mostly
due to genetic disorder.

Tetany: Rapid spasms (wild contractions) in muscle due to low Ca++ in
body fluid.

Arthritis: Inflammation of joints.

Osteoporosis: Age-related disorder characterised by decreased bone mass
and increased chances of fractures. Decreased levels of estrogen is a
common cause.

Gout: Inflammation of joints due to accumulation of uric acid crystals.

SUMMARY

Movement is an essential feature of all living beings. Protoplasmic streaming, ciliary
movements, movements of fins, limbs, wings, etc., are some forms exhibited by
animals. A voluntary movement which causes the animal to change its place, is

Reprint 2025-26



228 BIOLOGY

called locomotion. Animals move generally in search of food, shelter, mate, breeding
ground, better climate or to protect themselves.

The cells of the human body exhibit amoeboid, ciliary and muscular
movements. Locomotion and many other movements require coordinated muscular
activities. Three types of muscles are present in our body. Skeletal muscles are
attached to skeletal elements. They appear striated and are voluntary in nature.
Visceral muscles, present in the inner walls of visceral organs are nonstriated and
involuntary. Cardiac muscles are the muscles of the heart. They are striated,
branched and involuntary. Muscles possess excitability, contractility, extensibility
and elasticity.

Muscle fibre is the anatomical unit of muscle. Each muscle fibre has many
parallelly arranged myofibrils. Each myofibril contains many serially arranged
units called sarcomere which are the functional units. Each sarcomere has a central
‘A’ band made of thick myosin filaments, and two half ‘I’ bands made of thin actin
filaments on either side of it marked by ‘Z’  lines. Actin and myosin are polymerised
proteins with contractility. The active sites for myosin on resting actin filament are
masked by a protein-troponin. Myosin head contains ATPase and has ATP binding
sites and active sites for actin. A motor neuron carries signal to the muscle fibre
which generates an action potential in it. This causes the release of Ca++ from
sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca++ activates actin which binds to the myosin head to
form a cross bridge. These cross bridges pull the actin filaments causing them to
slide over the myosin filaments and thereby causing contraction. Ca++ are then
returned to sarcoplasmic reticulum which inactivate the actin. Cross bridges are
broken and the muscles relax.

Repeated stimulation of muscles leads to fatigue. Muscles are classified as
Red and White fibres based primarily on the amount of red coloured myoglobin
pigment in them.

Bones and cartilages constitute our skeletal system. The skeletal system is
divisible into axial and appendicular. Skull, vertebral column, ribs and sternum
constitute the axial skeleton. Limb bones and girdles form the appendicular
skeleton. Three types of joints are formed between bones or between bone and
cartilage – fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial. Synovial joints allow considerable
movements and therefore, play a significant role in locomotion.

NEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 231

18.1 NEURAL SYSTEM

The neural system of all animals is composed of highly specialised cells called
neurons which can detect, receive and transmit different kinds of stimuli.

The neural organisation is very simple in lower invertebrates. For
example, in Hydra it is composed of a network of neurons. The neural
system is better organised in insects, where a brain is present along with
a number of ganglia and neural tissues. The vertebrates have a more
developed neural system.

18.2 HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEM

The human neural system is divided into two parts :
(i) the central neural system (CNS)
(ii) the peripheral neural system (PNS)

The CNS includes the brain and the spinal cord and is the site of
information processing and control. The PNS comprises of all the nerves
of the body associated with the CNS (brain and spinal cord). The nerve
fibres of the PNS are of two types :

(a) afferent fibres
(b) efferent fibres

The afferent nerve fibres transmit impulses from tissues/organs to
the CNS and the efferent fibres transmit regulatory impulses from the
CNS to the concerned peripheral tissues/organs.

The PNS is divided into two divisions called somatic neural system
and autonomic neural system. The somatic neural system relays
impulses from the CNS to skeletal muscles while the autonomic neural
system transmits impulses from the CNS to the involuntary organs and
smooth muscles of the body. The autonomic neural system is further
classified into sympathetic neural system and parasympathetic neural
system.
       Visceral nervous system is the part of the peripheral nervous system
that comprises the whole complex of nerves, fibres, ganglia, and plexuses
by which impulses travel from the central nervous system to the viscera
and from the viscera to the central nervous system.

18.3 NEURON AS STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL UNIT OF

NEURAL SYSTEM

A neuron is a microscopic structure composed of three major parts, namely,
cell body, dendrites and axon (Figure 18.1). The cell body contains cytoplasm
with typical cell organelles and certain granular bodies called Nissl’s granules.
Short fibres which branch repeatedly and project out of the cell body also

Reprint 2025-26



232 BIOLOGY

contain Nissl’s granules and are called dendrites. These
fibres transmit impulses towards the cell body.   The
axon is a long fibre, the distal end of which is branched.
Each branch terminates as a bulb-like structure called
synaptic knob which possess synaptic vesicles
containing chemicals called neurotransmitters. The
axons transmit nerve impulses away from the cell body
to a synapse or to a neuro-muscular junction. Based
on the number of axon and dendrites, the neurons are
divided into three types, i.e., multipolar (with one axon
and two or more dendrites; found in the cerebral cortex),
bipolar (with one axon and one dendrite, found in the
retina of eye) and unipolar (cell body with one axon
only; found usually in the embryonic stage). There are
two types of axons, namely, myelinated and non-
myelinated. The myelinated nerve fibres are enveloped
with Schwann cells, which form a myelin sheath
around the axon. The gaps between two adjacent
myelin sheaths are called nodes of Ranvier.
Myelinated nerve fibres are found in spinal and cranial
nerves. Unmyelinated nerve fibre is enclosed by a
Schwann cell that does not form a myelin sheath
around the axon, and is commonly found in
autonomous and the somatic neural systems.

18.3.1 Generation and Conduction of
Figure 18.1 Structure of a neuron Nerve Impulse

Neurons are excitable cells because their membranes are in a polarised
state. Do you know why the membrane of a neuron is polarised? Different
types of ion channels are present on the neural membrane. These ion
channels are selectively permeable to different ions. When a neuron is not
conducting any impulse, i.e., resting, the axonal membrane is

+
comparatively more permeable to potassium ions (K ) and nearly
impermeable to sodium ions (Na+). Similarly, the membrane is
impermeable to negatively charged proteins present in the axoplasm.
Consequently, the axoplasm inside the axon contains high concentration
of K+ and negatively charged proteins and low concentration of Na+. In
contrast, the fluid outside the axon contains a low concentration of K+, a
high concentration of Na+ and thus form a concentration gradient. These
ionic gradients across the resting membrane are maintained by the active
transport of ions by the sodium-potassium pump which transports 3

axonal membrane possesses a positive charge while its inner surface

becomes negatively charged and, therefore is, polarised. The electrical
potential difference across the resting plasma membrane is called as the
resting potential.

You might be curious to know about the mechanisms of generation
of nerve impulse and its conduction along an axon. When a stimulus is
applied at a site (Figure 18.2 e.g., point A) on the polarised membrane,
the membrane at the site A becomes freely permeable to Na+. This leads
to a rapid influx of Na+ followed by the reversal of the polarity at that site,
i.e., the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged and
the inner side becomes positively charged. The polarity of the membrane
at the site A is thus reversed and hence depolarised. The electrical potential
difference across the plasma membrane at the site A is called the
action potential, which is in fact termed as a nerve impulse. At sites
immediately ahead, the axon (e.g., site B) membrane has a positive charge
on the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface. As a
result, a current flows on the inner surface from site A to site B. On the
outer surface current flows from site B to site A (Figure 18.2) to complete
the circuit of current flow. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed, and
an action potential is generated at site B.  Thus, the impulse (action
potential) generated at site A arrives at site B. The sequence is repeated
along the length of the axon and consequently the impulse is conducted.
The rise in the stimulus-induced permeability to Na+ is extremely short-
lived. It is quickly followed by a rise in permeability to K+. Within a fraction
of a second, K+ diffuses outside the membrane and restores the resting
potential of the membrane at the site of excitation and the fibre becomes
once more responsive to further stimulation.

234 BIOLOGY

18.3.2 Transmission of Impulses

A nerve impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another through
junctions called synapses. A synapse is formed by the membranes of a
pre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron, which may or may not
be separated by a gap called synaptic cleft. There are two types of
synapses, namely, electrical synapses and chemical synapses. At electrical
synapses, the membranes of pre- and post-synaptic neurons are in very
close proximity. Electrical current can flow directly from one neuron into
the other across these synapses. Transmission of an impulse across
electrical synapses is very similar to impulse conduction along a single
axon. Impulse transmission across an electrical synapse is always faster
than that across a chemical synapse. Electrical synapses are rare in our
system.

At a chemical synapse, the membranes of the pre- and post-synaptic
neurons are separated by a fluid-filled space called synaptic cleft
(Figure 18.3). Do you know how the pre-synaptic neuron transmits an
impulse (action potential) across the synaptic cleft to the post-synaptic
neuron? Chemicals called neurotransmitters are involved in the
transmission of impulses at these synapses. The axon terminals contain
vesicles filled with these neurotransmitters. When an impulse (action
potential) arrives at the axon terminal, it stimulates the movement of the
synaptic vesicles towards the membrane where they fuse with the plasma

NEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 235

membrane and release their neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. The
released neurotransmitters bind to their specific receptors, present on
the post-synaptic membrane. This binding opens ion channels allowing
the entry of ions which can generate a new potential in the post-synaptic
neuron. The new potential developed may be either excitatory or
inhibitory.

18.4 CENTRAL NEURAL SYSTEM

The brain is the central information processing organ of our body, and
acts as the ‘command and control system’. It controls the voluntary
movements, balance of the body, functioning of vital involuntary organs
(e.g., lungs, heart, kidneys, etc.), thermoregulation, hunger and thirst,
circadian (24-hour) rhythms of our body, activities of several endocrine
glands and human behaviour.  It is also the site for processing of vision,
hearing, speech, memory, intelligence, emotions and thoughts.

The human brain is well protected by the skull. Inside the skull, the
brain is covered by cranial meninges consisting of an outer layer called
dura mater, a very thin middle layer called arachnoid and an inner layer
(which is in contact with the brain tissue) called pia mater. The brain can
be divided into three major parts: (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain, and
(iii) hindbrain (Figure 18.4).

Forebrain



236 BIOLOGY

18.4.1 Forebrain

The forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and hypothalamus
(Figure 18.4). Cerebrum forms the major part of the human brain. A deep
cleft divides the cerebrum longitudinally into two halves, which are termed
as the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The hemispheres are
connected by a tract of nerve fibres called corpus callosum. The layer of
cells which covers the cerebral hemisphere is called cerebral cortex and is
thrown into prominent folds. The cerebral cortex is referred to as the grey
matter due to its greyish appearance. The neuron cell bodies are
concentrated here giving the colour. The cerebral cortex contains motor
areas, sensory areas and large regions that are neither clearly sensory
nor motor in function. These regions called as the association areas are
responsible for complex functions like intersensory associations, memory
and communication. Fibres of the tracts are covered with the myelin sheath,
which constitute the inner part of cerebral hemisphere. They give an
opaque white appearance to the layer and, hence, is called the white matter.
The cerebrum wraps around a structure called thalamus, which is a major
coordinating centre for sensory and motor signaling. Another very
important part of the brain called hypothalamus lies at the base of the
thalamus. The hypothalamus contains a number of centres which control
body temperature, urge for eating and drinking. It also contains several
groups of neurosecretory cells, which secrete hormones called
hypothalamic hormones. The inner parts of cerebral hemispheres and a
group of associated deep structures like amygdala, hippocampus, etc.,
form a complex structure called the limbic lobe or limbic system. Along
with the hypothalamus, it is involved in the regulation of sexual behaviour,
expression of emotional reactions (e.g., excitement, pleasure, rage and
fear), and motivation.

18.4.2 Midbrain
The midbrain is located between the thalamus/hypothalamus of the
forebrain and pons of the hindbrain. A canal called the cerebral aqueduct
passess through the midbrain. The dorsal portion of the midbrain consists
mainly of four round swellings (lobes) called corpora quadrigemina.

18.4.3 Hindbrain
The hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla (also called
the medulla oblongata). Pons consists of fibre tracts that interconnect
different regions of the brain. Cerebellum has very convoluted surface in
order to provide the additional space for many more neurons. The medulla
of the brain is connected to the spinal cord. The medulla contains centres
which control respiration, cardiovascular reflexes and gastric secretions.

Three major regions make up the brain stem; mid brain, pons
and medulla oblongata. Brain stem forms the connections between
the brain and spinal cord.

NEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 237

SUMMARY

The neural system coordinates and integrates functions as well as metabolic
and homeostatic activities of all the organs. Neurons, the functional units of
neural system are excitable cells due to a differential concentration gradient of
ions across the membrane. The electrical potential difference across the resting
neural membrane is called the ‘resting potential’. The nerve impulse is conducted
along the axon membrane in the form of a wave of depolarisation and
repolarisation. A synapse is formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuron
and a post-synaptic neuron which may or may not be separated by a gap called
synaptic cleft. Chemicals involved in the transmission of impulses at chemical
synapses are called neurotransmitters.

Human neural system consists of two parts : (i) central neural system (CNS)
and (ii) the peripheral neural system. The CNS consists of the brain and spiral
cord. The brain can be divided into three major parts : (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain
and (iii) hindbrain. The forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and
hypothalamus. The cerebrum is longitudinally divided into two halves that are
connected by the corpus callosum. A very important part of the forebrain called
hypothalamus controls the body temperature, eating and drinking. Inner parts
of cerebral hemispheres and a group of associated deep structures form a complex
structure called limbic system which is concerned with olfaction, autonomic
responses, regulation of sexual behaviour, expression of emotional reactions,
and motivation. The midbrain receives and integrates visual, tactile and auditory
inputs. The hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla. The cerebellum
integrates information received from the semicircular canals of the ear and the
auditory system. The medulla contains centres, which control respiration,
cardiovascular reflexes, and gastric secretions. Pons consist of fibre tracts that
interconnect different regions of the brain.

Hormone Action chemical produced by endocrine glands and released into the blood and
transported to a distantly located target organ has current scientific
definition as follows: Hormones are non-nutrient chemicals which
act as intercellular messengers and are produced in trace amounts.
The new definition covers a number of new molecules in addition to the
hormones secreted by the organised endocrine glands. Invertebrates
possess very simple endocrine systems with few hormones whereas a large
number of chemicals act as hormones and provide coordination in the
vertebrates. The human endocrine system is described here.

basal part of diencephalon, forebrain
(Figure 19.1) and it regulates a wide
spectrum of body functions. It contains
several groups of neurosecretory cells

Figure 19.1 Location of endocrine glands
called nuclei which produce hormones.
These hormones regulate the synthesis
and secretion of pituitary hormones.
However, the hormones produced by
hypothalamus are of two types, the

releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) and
the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones).
For example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasing
hormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release of
gonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamus
inhibits the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones
originating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass through axons and are
released from their nerve endings. These hormones reach the pituitary
gland through a portal circulatory system and regulate the functions of
the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under the direct neural
regulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 19.2).

19.2.2 The Pituitary Gland Hypothalamus

The pituitary gland is located in a bony cavity Hypothalamic
neurons

called sella tursica and is attached to
hypothalamus by a stalk (Figure 19.2). It is
divided anatomically into an adenohypophysis
and a neurohypophysis. Adenohypophysis
consists of two portions, pars distalis and pars
intermedia. The pars distalis region of pituitary,
commonly called anterior pituitary, produces
growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH), Portal circulation

adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH),
luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH). Pars intermedia Posterior

pituitary
secretes only one hormone called melanocyte
stimulating hormone (MSH). However, in
humans, the pars intermedia is almost merged Anterior

pituitary
with pars distalis. Neurohypophysis (pars
nervosa) also known as posterior pituitary, stores Figure 19.2 Diagrammatic representation of

pituitary and its relationship with
and releases two hormones called oxytocin and hypothalamus
vasopressin, which are actually synthesised by
the hypothalamus and are transported axonally to neurohypophysis.

Over-secretion of GH stimulates abnormal growth of the body leading
to gigantism and low secretion of GH results in stunted growth resulting
in pituitary dwarfism. Excess secretion of growth hormone in adults
especially in middle age can result in severe disfigurement (especially of
the face) called Acromegaly, which may lead to serious complications,
and premature death if unchecked. The disease is hard to diagnose in
the early stages and often goes undetected for many years, until changes
in external features become noticeable. Prolactin regulates the growth of
the mammary glands and formation of milk in them. TSH stimulates the
synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. ACTH
stimulates the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones called
glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. LH and FSH stimulate gonadal
activity and hence are called gonadotrophins. In males, LH stimulates
the synthesis and secretion of hormones called androgens from testis.
In males, FSH and androgens regulate spermatogenesis. In females, LH
induces ovulation of fully mature follicles (graafian follicles) and maintains
the corpus luteum, formed from the remnants of the graafian follicles
after ovulation. FSH stimulates growth and development of the ovarian

242 BIOLOGY

follicles in females. MSH acts on the melanocytes
(melanin containing cells) and regulates pigmentation
of the skin. Oxytocin acts on the smooth muscles of
our body and stimulates their contraction. In females,
it stimulates a vigorous contraction of uterus at the
time of child birth, and milk ejection from the mammary
gland. Vasopressin acts mainly at the kidney and
stimulates resorption of water and electrolytes by the
distal tubules and thereby reduces loss of water
through urine (diuresis). Hence, it is also called as anti-
diuretic hormone (ADH).

An impairment affecting synthesis or release of ADH
results in a diminished ability of the kidney to conserve
water leading to water loss and dehydration. This
condition is known as Diabetes Insipidus.

19.2.3 The Pineal Gland

The pineal gland is located on the dorsal side of
forebrain. Pineal secretes a hormone called melatonin.
Melatonin plays a very important role in the regulation
of a 24-hour (diurnal) rhythm of our body. For
example, it helps in maintaining the normal rhythms
of sleep-wake cycle, body temperature. In addition,
melatonin also influences metabolism, pigmentation,
the menstrual cycle as well as our defense capability.

19.2.4 Thyroid Gland

The thyroid gland is composed of two lobes which are
located on either side of the trachea (Figure 19.3 a). Both
the lobes are interconnected with a thin flap of connective
tissue called isthmus. The thyroid gland is composed of
follicles and stromal tissues. Each thyroid follicle is
composed of follicular cells, enclosing a cavity. These
follicular cells synthesise two hormones,
tetraiodothyronine or thyroxine (T ) and

4

triiodothyronine (T ). Iodine is essential for the normal
3

rate of hormone synthesis in the thyroid. Deficiency of
iodine in our diet results in hypothyroidism and

retardation, low intelligence quotient, abnormal skin, deaf-mutism, etc. In
adult women, hypothyroidism may cause menstrual cycle to become
irregular. Due to cancer of the thyroid gland or due to development of
nodules of the thyroid glands, the rate of synthesis and secretion of the
thyroid hormones is increased to abnormal high levels leading to a condition
called hyperthyroidism which adversely affects the body physiology.

Exopthalmic goitre is a form of hyperthyroidism, characterised by
enlargement of the thyroid gland, protrusion of the eyeballs, increased
basal metabolic rate, and weight loss, also called Graves’ disease.

Thyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal
metabolic rate. These hormones also support the process of red blood cell
formation. Thyroid hormones control the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins
and fats. Maintenance of water and electrolyte balance is also influenced by
thyroid hormones. Thyroid gland also secretes a protein hormone called
thyrocalcitonin (TCT) which regulates the blood calcium levels.

19.2.5 Parathyroid Gland

In humans, four parathyroid glands are present on the back side of the
thyroid gland, one pair each in the two lobes of the thyroid gland (Figure
19.3 b). The parathyroid glands secrete a peptide hormone called
parathyroid hormone (PTH). The secretion of PTH is regulated by the
circulating levels of calcium ions.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases the Ca2+ levels in the blood. PTH
acts on bones and stimulates the process of bone resorption (dissolution/
demineralisation). PTH also stimulates reabsorption of Ca2+ by the renal
tubules and increases Ca2+ absorption from the digested food. It is, thus,
clear that PTH is a hypercalcemic hormone, i.e., it increases the blood
Ca2+ levels. Along with TCT, it plays a significant role in calcium balance
in the body.

19.2.6 Thymus

The thymus gland is a lobular structure located between lungs behind
sternum on the ventral side of aorta. The thymus plays a major role in
the development of the immune system. This gland secretes the peptide
hormones called thymosins. Thymosins play a major role in the
differentiation of T-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediated
immunity. In addition, thymosins also promote production of antibodies
to provide humoral immunity. Thymus is degenerated in old individuals
resulting in a decreased production of thymosins. As a result, the immune
responses of old persons become weak.

19.2.7 Adrenal Gland

Our body has one pair of adrenal glands, one above of each kidney (Figure
19.4 a). The gland is composed of two types of tissues. The centrally located
tissue is called the adrenal medulla, and outside this lies the adrenal
cortex (Figure 19.4 b).

Underproduction of hormones by the adrenal cortex alters
carbohydrate metabolism causing acute weakness and fatigue leading
to a disease called Addison’s disease.

Adrenal cortex
Adrenal gland

Adrenal medulla
Kidney

Figure 19.4  Diagrammatic representation of : (a) Adrenal gland above kidney (b) Section

showing two parts of adrenal gland

The adrenal medulla secretes two hormones called adrenaline or
epinephrine and noradrenaline or norepinephrine. These are
commonly called as catecholamines. Adrenaline and noradrenaline are
rapidly secreted in response to stress of any kind and during emergency
situations and are called emergency hormones or hormones of Fight
or Flight. These hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation,
piloerection (raising of hairs), sweating etc. Both the hormones increase
the heart beat, the strength of heart contraction and the rate of respiration.
Catecholamines also stimulate the breakdown of glycogen resulting in

Reprint 2025-26



CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION 245

an increased concentration of glucose in blood. In addition, they also
stimulate the breakdown of lipids and proteins.

The adrenal cortex can be divided into three layers, called zona
reticularis (inner layer), zona fasciculata (middle layer) and zona
glomerulosa (outer layer). The adrenal cortex secretes many hormones,
commonly called as corticoids. The corticoids, which are involved in
carbohydrate metabolism are called glucocorticoids. In our body, cortisol
is the main glucocorticoid. Corticoids, which regulate the balance of water
and electrolytes in our body are called mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone is
the main mineralocorticoid in our body.

Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and proteolysis;
and inhibit cellular uptake and utilisation of amino acids. Cortisol is also
involved in maintaining the cardio-vascular system as well as the kidney
functions. Glucocorticoids, particularly cortisol, produces anti-
inflammatory reactions and suppresses the immune response. Cortisol
stimulates the RBC production. Aldosterone acts mainly at the renal
tubules and stimulates the reabsorption of Na+ and water and excretion
of K+ and phosphate ions. Thus, aldosterone helps in the maintenance of
electrolytes, body fluid volume, osmotic pressure and blood pressure.
Small amounts of androgenic steroids are also secreted by the adrenal
cortex which play a role in the growth of axial hair, pubic hair and facial
hair during puberty.

19.2.8 Pancreas

Pancreas is a composite gland (Figure 19.1) which acts as both exocrine
and endocrine gland. The endocrine pancreas consists of ‘Islets of
Langerhans’. There are about 1 to 2 million Islets of Langerhans in a
normal human pancreas representing only 1 to 2 per cent of the pancreatic
tissue. The two main types of cells in the Islet of Langerhans are called
α-cells and β-cells. The α-cells secrete a hormone called glucagon, while
the β-cells secrete insulin.

Glucagon is a peptide hormone, and plays an important role in
maintaining the normal blood glucose levels. Glucagon acts mainly on
the liver cells (hepatocytes) and stimulates glycogenolysis resulting in an
increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia). In addition, this hormone
stimulates the process of gluconeogenesis which also contributes to
hyperglycemia. Glucagon reduces the cellular glucose uptake and
utilisation. Thus, glucagon is a hyperglycemic hormone.

Insulin is a peptide hormone, which plays a major role in the
regulation of glucose homeostasis. Insulin acts mainly on hepatocytes
and adipocytes (cells of adipose tissue), and enhances cellular glucose

Reprint 2025-26



246 BIOLOGY

uptake and utilisation. As a result, there is a rapid movement of glucose
from blood to hepatocytes and adipocytes resulting in decreased blood
glucose levels (hypoglycemia). Insulin also stimulates conversion of
glucose to glycogen (glycogenesis) in the target cells. The glucose
homeostasis in blood is thus maintained jointly by the two – insulin and
glucagons.

Prolonged hyperglycemia leads to a complex disorder called diabetes
mellitus which is associated with loss of glucose through urine and
formation of harmful compounds known as ketone bodies. Diabetic
patients are successfully treated with insulin therapy.

19.2.9 Testis

A pair of testis is present in the scrotal sac (outside abdomen) of male
individuals (Figure 19.1). Testis performs dual functions as a primary
sex organ as well as an endocrine gland. Testis is composed of
seminiferous tubules and stromal or interstitial tissue. The Leydig
cells or interstitial cells, which are present in the intertubular
spaces produce a group of hormones called androgens mainly
testosterone.

Androgens regulate the development, maturation and functions of
the male accessory sex organs like epididymis, vas deferens, seminal
vesicles, prostate gland, urethra etc. These hormones stimulate muscular
growth, growth of facial and axillary hair, aggressiveness, low pitch of
voice etc. Androgens play a major stimulatory role in the process of
spermatogenesis (formation of spermatozoa). Androgens act on the central
neural system and influence the male sexual behaviour (libido). These
hormones produce anabolic (synthetic) effects on protein and carbohydrate
metabolism.

19.2.10 Ovary

Females have a pair of ovaries located in the abdomen (Figure 19.1). Ovary
is the primary female sex organ which produces one ovum during each
menstrual cycle. In addition, ovary also produces two groups of steroid
hormones called estrogen and progesterone. Ovary is composed of
ovarian follicles and stromal tissues. The estrogen is synthesised and
secreted mainly by the growing ovarian follicles. After ovulation, the
ruptured follicle is converted to a structure called corpus luteum, which
secretes mainly progesterone.

Estrogens produce wide ranging actions such as stimulation of growth
and activities of female secondary sex organs, development of growing

Reprint 2025-26



CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION 247

ovarian follicles, appearance of female secondary sex characters (e.g., high
pitch of voice, etc.) and mammary gland development. Estrogens also
regulate female sexual behaviour.

Progesterone supports pregnancy. Progesterone also acts on the
mammary glands and stimulates the formation of alveoli (sac-like
structures which store milk) and milk secretion.

19.3 HORMONES OF HEART, KIDNEY AND GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT

Now you know about the endocrine glands and their hormones. However,
as mentioned earlier, hormones are also secreted by some tissues which
are not endocrine glands. For example, the atrial wall of our heart secretes
a very important peptide hormone called atrial natriuretic factor (ANF),
which decreases blood pressure. When blood pressure is increased, ANF
is secreted which causes dilation of the blood vessels. This reduces the
blood pressure.

The juxtaglomerular cells of kidney produce a peptide hormone called
erythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis (formation of RBC).

Endocrine cells present in different parts of the gastro-intestinal tract
secrete four major peptide hormones, namely gastrin, secretin,
cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). Gastrin
acts on the gastric glands and stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric
acid and pepsinogen. Secretin acts on the exocrine pancreas and
stimulates secretion of water and bicarbonate ions. CCK acts on both
pancreas and gall bladder and stimulates the secretion of pancreatic
enzymes and bile juice, respectively. GIP inhibits gastric secretion and
motility. Several other non-endocrine tissues secrete hormones called
growth factors. These factors are essential for the normal growth of tissues
and their repairing/regeneration.

19.4 MECHANISM OF HORMONE ACTION

Hormones produce their effects on target tissues by binding to specific
proteins called hormone receptors located in the target tissues only.
Hormone receptors present on the cell membrane of the target cells are
called membrane-bound receptors and the receptors present inside the
target cell are called intracellular receptors, mostly nuclear receptors
(present in the nucleus). Binding of a hormone to its receptor leads to the
formation of a hormone-receptor complex (Figure 19.5 a, b). Each
receptor is specific to one hormone only and hence receptors are specific.
Hormone-Receptor complex formation leads to certain biochemical
changes in the target tissue. Target tissue metabolism and hence

physiological functions are regulated by hormones. On the basis of their
chemical nature, hormones can be divided into groups :

(i) peptide, polypeptide, protein hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon,
pituitary hormones, hypothalamic hormones, etc.)

(ii) steroids (e.g., cortisol, testosterone, estradiol and progesterone)
(iii) iodothyronines (thyroid hormones)
(iv) amino-acid derivatives (e.g., epinephrine).

Hormones  which interact with membrane-bound receptors normally
do not enter the target cell, but generate second messengers (e.g., cyclic
AMP, IP , Ca++ etc) which in turn regulate cellular metabolism (Figure

3

19.5a). Hormones which interact with intracellular receptors (e.g., steroid
hormones, iodothyronines, etc.) mostly regulate gene expression or
chromosome function by the interaction of hormone-receptor complex
with the genome. Cumulative biochemical actions result in physiological
and developmental effects (Figure 19.5b).

SUMMARY

There are special chemicals which act as hormones and provide chemical
coordination, integration and regulation in the human body. These hormones
regulate metabolism, growth and development of our organs, the endocrine glands
or certain cells. The endocrine system is composed of hypothalamus, pituitary
and pineal, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid, thymus and gonads (testis
and ovary). In addition to these, some other organs, e.g., gastrointestinal tract,
kidney, heart etc., also produce hormones. The pituitary gland is divided into
three major parts, which are called as  pars distalis, pars intermedia and pars
nervosa. Pars distalis produces six trophic hormones. Pars intermedia secretes

Reprint 2025-26



250 BIOLOGY

only one hormone, while pars nervosa (neurohypophysis) secretes two hormones.
The pituitary hormones regulate the growth and development of somatic tissues
and activities of peripheral endocrine glands. Pineal gland secretes melatonin, which
plays a very important role in the regulation of 24-hour (diurnal) rhythms of our
body (e.g., rhythms of sleep and state of being awake, body temperature, etc.). The
thyroid gland hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal
metabolic rate, development and maturation of the central neural system,
erythropoiesis, metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats, menstrual cycle.
Another thyroid hormone, i.e., thyrocalcitonin regulates calcium levels in our blood
by decreasing it. The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) which
increases the blood Ca2+ levels and plays a major role in calcium homeostasis. The
thymus gland secretes thymosins which play a major role in the differentiation of
T-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediated immunity. In addition, thymosins
also increase the production of antibodies to provide humoral immunity. The
adrenal gland is composed of the centrally located adrenal medulla and the outer
adrenal cortex. The adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine.
These hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation, piloerection, sweating, heart
beat, strength of heart contraction, rate of respiration, glycogenolysis, lipolysis,
proteolysis. The adrenal cortex secretes glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.
Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, proteolysis, erythropoiesis,
cardio-vascular system, blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate and inhibit
inflammatory reactions by suppressing the immune response. Mineralocorticoids
regulate water and electrolyte contents of the body. The endocrine pancreas secretes
glucagon and insulin. Glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
resulting in hyperglycemia. Insulin stimulates cellular glucose uptake and
utilisation, and glycogenesis resulting in hypoglycemia. Insulin deficiency
and/or insulin resistance result in a disease called diabetes mellitus.

The testis secretes androgens, which stimulate the development, maturation
and functions of the male accessory sex organs, appearance of the male secondary
sex characters, spermatogenesis, male sexual behaviour, anabolic pathways and
erythropoiesis. The ovary secretes estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen stimulates
growth and development of female accessory sex organs and secondary sex
characters. Progesterone plays a major role in the maintenance of pregnancy as
well as in mammary gland development and lactation. The atrial wall of the heart
produces atrial natriuretic factor which decreases the blood pressure. Kidney
produces erythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis. The gastrointestinal tract
secretes gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin and gastric inhibitory peptide. These
hormones regulate the secretion of digestive juices and help in digestion.
