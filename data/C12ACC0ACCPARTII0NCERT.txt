it has certain special features which distinguish it from the other forms of
organisation. These are as follows:

• Body Corporate: A company is formed according to the provisions of
Law enforced from time to time. Generally, in India, the companies are
formed and registered under Companies Law except in the case of Banking
and Insurance companies for which a separate Law is provided for.

• Separate Legal Entity: A company has a separate legal entity which is
distinct and separate from its members. It can hold and deal with any
type of property. It can enter into contracts and even open a bank account
in its own name.

• Limited Liability: The liability of the members of the company is limited
to the extent of unpaid amount of the shares held by them. In the case of
the companies limited by guarantee, the liability of its members is limited
to the extent of the guarantee given by them in the event of the company
being wound up.

• Perpetual Succession: The company being an artificial person created by
law continues to exist irrespective of the changes in its membership. A
company can be terminated only through law. The death or insanity or
insolvency of any member of the company in no way affects the existence of
the company. Members may come and go but the company continues.

• Common Seal: The company being an artificial person, cannot sign its name
by itself. Therefore, every company is required to have its own seal which
acts as official signatures of the company. Any document which does not
carry the common seal of the company is not binding on the company.

• Transferability of Shares: The shares of a public limited company are
freely transferable. The permission of the company or the consent of any
member of the company is not necessary for the transfer of shares. But
the Articles of the company can prescribe the manner in which the transfer
of shares will be made.

• May Sue or be Sued: A company being a legal person can enter into
contracts and can enforce the contractual rights against others. It can
sue and be sued in its name if there is a breach of contract by the company.

1.2 Kinds of Companies

Companies can be classified either on the basis of the liability of its members
or on the basis of the number of members. On the basis of liability of its
members the companies can be classified into the following three categories:

(i) Companies Limited by Shares: In this case, the liability of its members
is limited to the extent of the nominal value of shares held by them. If
a member has paid the full amount of the shares, there is no liability
on his part whatsoever may be for the debts of the company. He need
not pay a single paise from his private property. However, if there is

Reprint 2025-26



Accounting for Share Capital 3

any liability involved, it can be enforced during the existence of the
company as well as during the winding up.

(ii) Companies Limited by Guarantee: In this case, the liability of its members
is limited to the amount they undertake to contribute in the event of
the company being wound up. Thus, the liability of the members will
arise only in the event of its winding up.

(iii) Unlimited Companies: When there is no limit on the liability of its
members, the company is called an unlimited company. When the
company’s property is not sufficient to pay off its debts, the private
property of its members can be used for the purpose. In other words,
the creditors can claim their dues from its members. Such companies
are not found in India even though permitted by the Companies Act.

On the basis of the number of members, companies can be divided into
three categories as follows:

(i) Public Company: A public company means a company which (a) is not
a private company; (b) is a company which is not a subsidiary of a
private company.

(ii) Private Company: A private company is one which by its articles of
association:
(a) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;
(b) A private company must have at least 2 persons, except in case

of one person company;
(c) Limits the number of its members to 200 (excluding its

employees);
(iii) One Person Company (OPC): Sec. 2 (62) of the companies Act, 2013,

defines OPC as a “company which has only one person as a member”.
Rule 3 of the Companies (Incorporation) Rules, 2014 provides that:
(a) Only a natural person being an Indian citizen and resident in

India can form one person company,
(b) It cannot carry out non-banking financial investment activities.
(c) Its paid up share capital is not more than Rs. 50 Lakhs
(d) Its average annual turnover of three years does not exceed

Rs. 2 Crores.
1.3 Share Capital of a Company
A company, being an artificial person, cannot generate its own capital which
has necessarily to be collected from several persons. These persons are known
as shareholders and the amount contributed by them is called share capital.
Since the number of shareholders is very very large, a separate capital account
cannot be opened for each one of them. Hence, innumerable streams of capital
contribution merge their identities in a common capital account called as
‘Share Capital Account’.

1.3.1 Categories of Share Capital
From accounting point of view the share capital of the company can be classified
as follows:
• Authorised Capital: Authorised capital is the amount of share capital which

a company is authorised to issue by its Memorandum of Association. The
company cannot raise more than the amount of capital as specified in the
Memorandum of Association. It is also called Nominal or Registered capital.
The authorised capital can be increased or decreased as per the procedure
laid down in the Companies Act. It should be noted that the company need
not issue the entire authorised capital for public subscription at a time.
Depending upon its requirement, it may issue share capital but in any
case, it should not be more than the amount of authorised capital.

• Issued Capital: It is that part of the authorised capital which is actually
issued to the public for subscription including the shares allotted to vendors
and the signatories to the company’s memorandum. The authorised capital
which is not offered for public subscription is known as ‘unissued capital’.
Unissued capital may be offered for public subscription at a later date.

• Subscribed Capital: It is that part of the issued capital which has been
actually subscribed by the public. When the shares offered for public
subscription are subscribed fully by the public the issued capital and
subscribed capital would be the same. It may be noted that ultimately,
the subscribed capital may be equal to or less than issued capital. In
case the number of shares subscribed is less than what is offered, the
company allots only the number of shares for which subscription has
been received. In case it is higher than what is offered, the allotment
will be equal to the offer. In other words, the fact of over subscription is
not reflected in the books.

• Called up Capital: It is that part of the subscribed capital which has been
called up on the shares, i.e., what the company has asked the shareholders
to pay. The company may decide to call the entire amount or part of the
face value of the shares, For example, if the face value (also called nominal
value) of a share allotted is Rs. 10 and the company has called up only Rs.
7 per share, in that scenario, the called up capital is Rs. 7 per share. The
remaining Rs. 3 may be collected from its shareholders as and when needed.

• Paid up Capital: It is that portion of the called up capital which has been
actually received from the shareholders. When the shareholders have paid
all the called amount, the called up capital is the same to the paid up
capital. If any of the shareholders has not paid amount on calls, such an
amount may be called as ‘calls in arrears’. Therefore, paid up capital is
equal to the called-up capital minus call in arrears.

• Uncalled Capital: That portion of the subscribed capital which has not yet
been called up. As stated earlier, the company may collect this amount
any time when it needs further funds.

Reprint 2025-26



Accounting for Share Capital 5

• Reserve Capital: A company may reserve a portion of its uncalled capital
to be called only in the event of winding up of the company. Such uncalled
amount is called ‘Reserve Capital’ of the company. It is available only
for the creditors on winding up of the company.

its capital as Rs. 40,00,000, divided into 4,00,000 shares of Rs. 10 each. The
company offered to the public for subscription of 2,00,000 shares of Rs. 10
each, to be received as Rs. 2 on application, Rs.3 on allotment, Rs.3 on first
call and the balance on final call. The company received applications for
2,50,000 shares. The company finalised the allotment of 2,00,000 shares
and rejected applications for 50,000 shares. The company did not make the
final call. The company received all the amount except on 2,000 shares where
call money has not been received. The above amounts will be shown in the
Notes to Accounts of the balance sheet of Sunrise Company Ltd. as follows:

1.4 Nature and Classes of Shares

Shares, refer to the units into which the total share capital of a company is
divided. Thus, a share is a fractional part of the share capital and forms the
basis of ownership interest in a company. The persons who contribute money
through shares are called shareholders.

The amount of authorised capital, together with the number of shares in
which it is divided, is stated in the Memorandum of Association but the classes
of shares in which the company’s capital is to be divided, along with their
respective rights and obligations, are prescribed by the Articles of Association
of the company. As per The Companies Act, a company can issue two types
of shares (1) preference shares, and (2) equity shares (also called ordinary
shares).

1.4.1 Preference Shares

According to Section 43 of The Companies Act, 2013, a preference share is one,
which fulfils the following conditions :

(a) That it carries a preferential right to dividend to be paid either as a
fixed amount payable to preference shareholders or an amount
calculated by a fixed rate of the nominal value of each share before
any dividend is paid to the equity shareholders.

(b) That with respect to capital it carries or will carry, on the winding up
of the company, the preferential right to the repayment of capital before
anything is paid to equity shareholders.

However, notwithstanding the above two conditions, a holder of the
preference share may have a right to participate fully or to a limited extent in
the surpluses of the company as specified in the Memorandum or Articles of
the company. Thus, the preference shares can be participating and non-
participating. Similarly, these shares can be cumulative or non-cumulative, and
redeemable or irredeemable.

1.4.2 Equity Shares
According to Section 43 of The Companies Act, 2013, an equity share is a share
which is not a preference share. In other words, shares which do not enjoy any
preferential right in the payment of dividend or repayment of capital, are termed
as equity/ordinary shares. The equity shareholders are entitled to share the
distributable profits of the company after satisfying the dividend rights of the
preference share holders. The dividend on equity shares is not fixed and it
may vary from year to year depending upon the amount of profits available

Reprint 2025-26

for distribution. The equity share capital may be (i) with voting rights; or (ii) with
differential rights as to voting, dividend or otherwise in accordance with such
rules and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed in the Articles of
Association of the company.

Test your Understanding – I

State which of the following statements are true :
(a) A company is an artificial person.
(b) Shareholders of a company are liable for the acts of the company.
(c) Every member of a company is entitled to take part in its management.
(d) Company’s shares are generally transferable.
(e) Share application account is a personal account.
(f) The director of a company must be a shareholder.
(g) Paid up capital can exceed called up capital.
(h) Capital reserves are created from capital profits.
(i) At the time of issue of shares, the maximum rate of securities

premium is 10%.
(j) The part of capital which is called up only on winding up is called

reserve capital.

1.5 Issue of Shares

A salient characteristic of the capital of a company is that the amount on its
shares can be gradually collected in easy instalments spread over a period of
time depending upon its growing financial requirement. The first instalment is
collected along with application and is thus, known as application money, the
second on allotment (termed as allotment money), and the remaining instalments
are termed as first call, second call and so on. The word final is suffixed to the
last instalment. However, this in no way which prevents a company from
calling the full amount on shares right at the time of application.

The important steps in the procedure of share issue are :
• Issue of Prospectus: The company first issues the prospectus to the

public. Prospectus is an invitation to the public that a new company has
come into existence and it needs funds for doing business. It contains
complete information about the company and the manner in which the
money is to be collected from the prospective investors.

• Receipt of Applications: When prospectus is issued to the public,
prospective investors intending to subscribe the share capital of the
company would make an application along with the application money

Reprint 2025-26



8 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

and deposit the same with a scheduled bank as specified in the
prospectus. The company has to get minimum subscription  within 120
days from the date of the issue of the prospectus. If the company fails to
receive the same within the said period, the company cannot proceed for
the allotment of shares and application money should be returned within
130 days of the date of issue of prospectus.

• Allotment of Shares: If minimum subscription has been received, the
company may proceed for the allotment of shares after fulfilling certain
other legal formalities. Letters of allotment are sent to those whom the
shares have been alloted, and letters of regret to those to whom no
allotment has been made. When allotment is made, it results in a valid
contract between the company and the applicants who now became the
shareholders of the company.

Minimum Subscription
The minimum amount that, in the opinion of directors, must be raised to meet the
needs of business operations of the company relating to:

 the price of any property purchased, or to be purchased, which has to be met
wholly or partly out of the proceeds of issue;

 preliminary expenses payable by the company and any commission payable
in connection with the issue of shares;

 the repayment of any money borrowed by the company for the above two
matters;

 working capital; and
 any other expenditure required for the usual conduct of business operations.

It is to be noted that ‘minimum subscription’ of capital cannot be less than 90%
of the issued amount according to SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection)
Guidelines, 2000 [6.3.8.1 and 6.3.8.2]. If this condition is not satisfied, the company
shall forthwith refund the entire subscription amount received. If a delay occurs
beyond 8 days from the date of closure of subscription list, the company shall be
liable to pay the amount with interest at the rate of 15% [Section 73(2)].

Shares of a company are issued either at par or at a premium. Shares are  to
be issued at par when their issue price is exactly equal to their nominal value
according to the terms and conditions of issue. When the shares of a company
are issued more than its nominal value (face value), the excess amount is
called premium.

Reprint 2025-26



Accounting for Share Capital 9

Irrespective of the fact that shares are issued at par or at a premium, the
share capital of a company as stated earlier, may be collected in instalments
payable at different stages.

1.6 Accounting Treatment

On application : The amount of money paid with various instalment represents
the contribution to share capital and should ultimately be credited to share
capital. However, for the sake of convenience, initially individual accounts are
opened for each instalment. All money received along with application is deposited
with a scheduled bank in a separate account opened for the purpose. The journal
entry is as follows:

Bank A/c Dr.
To Share Application A/c

(Amount received on application for — shares @ Rs. ______ per share)

On allotment : When minimum subscription has been received and certain legal
formalities on the allotment of shares have been duly compiled with, the directors
of the company proceed to make the allotment of shares.

The allotment of shares implies a contract between the company and the
applicants who now become the allottees and assume the status of shareholders
or members.

Allotment of Shares
(Implications from accounting point of view)

 It is customary to ask for some amount called “Allotment Money” from the
allottees on the shares allotted to them as soon as the allotment is made.

 With the acceptance to the offer made by the applicants, the amount of
application money received has to be transferred to share capital account as it
has formally become the part of the same.

 The money received on rejected applications should be fully returned to the
applicant within period prescribed by law/SEBI.

 In case lesser number of shares have to be allotted, than those applied for the
excess application money must be adjusted towards the amount due on allotment
from the allottees.

 The effect of the later two steps is to close the share application account
which is only a temporary account for share capital transactions.

called ‘Share Application and Allotment Account’ is opened in the books of a
company. The combined account is based on the reasoning that allotment
without application is impossible while application without allotment is
meaningless. These two stages of share capital are closely inter-related. When
a combined account is maintained, journal entries are recorded in the following
manner:

Applications Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA)

Initial Public Offers and Rights Issues etc. of securities (Shares, Debentures or Other
Financial Instruments) may be subscribed by paying Application Money by a banking
instrument (Cheque, Pay order / Draft, Debit to Bank Account or through Applications
Supported Blocked Amount (ASBA). ASBA is one of the methods for payment of
Application Money.

ASBA is a process developed by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)to
apply for subscribing to IPOs and Rights Issue etc. of securities. Under the method,
the applicant authorises the bank to block the bank account for the application
money, for subscribing the issue. The Bank debits the applicant’s account with
application money only if he / she is allotted securities (Shares / Debentures etc.) for
the amount payable on allotted securities. In case, securities are not allotted, the
bank removes the block (lien) on the amount.

Under ASBA based applications, Application Amount payable on the securities
applied is blocked by the bank i.e., it marks a lien on amount payable as Application
Money on Securities applied. After the company has allotted securities, bank debits
the applicant’s bank account by the amount payable on allotted securities and remove
the lien on the balance amount.

12 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

On Calls :  Calls play a vital role in making shares fully paid-up and for realising
the full amount of shares from the shareholders. In the event of shares not being
fully called up till the completion of allotment, the directors have the authority
to ask for the remaining amount on shares as and when they decide about the
same. It is also possible that the timing of the payment of calls by the shareholders
is determined at the time of share issue itself and given in the prospectus.

Two points are important regarding the calls on shares. First, the amount
on any call should not exceed 25% of the face value of shares. Second, there
must be an interval of at least one month between the making of two calls unless
otherwise provided by the articles of association of the company.

When a call is made and the amount of the same is received, the journal
entries are as given below:

1. For Call Amount Due
Share Call A/c Dr.

To Share Capital A/c
(Call money due on ___Shares @ Rs. ____ per share)

2. For Receipt of Call Amount
Bank A/c Dr.

To Share Call A/c
(Call money received)

The word/words First, Second, or Third must be added between the words
“Share” and ‘Call’ in the Share Call account depending upon the identity of the
call made. For example, in case of first call it will be termed as ‘Share First Call
Account’, in case of second call it will be ‘Share Second Call Account’ and so on.
Another point to be noted is that the words ‘and Final’ will also be added to the
last call, say, if second call is the last call it will be termed as ‘Second and Final
Call’ and if it is the third call which is the last call, it will be termed as ‘Third and
Final Call’. It is also possible that the whole balance after allotment may be
collected in one call only. In that case the first call itself, shall be termed as the
‘First and Final Call’.

The following points should be kept in mind while issuing the share capital for
public subscription :

1. The application money should be at least 5% of the face value of the share.
2. Calls are to be made as per the provisions of the articles of association.
3. Where there is no articles of association of its own, the following provisions

of Table A will apply:
(a) A period of one month must elapse between two calls;
(b) The amount of call should not exceed 25% of the face value of the share;

Reprint 2025-26



Accounting for Share Capital 13

(c) A minimum of 14 days’ notice is given to the shareholders to pay the
amount; and

(d) Calls must be made on a uniform basis on all shares within the same
class.

4. The procedure for accounting for the issue of both equity and preference shares
is the same. To differentiate between the two the words ‘Equity’ and ‘Preference’
is prefixed to each and every instalment.

1.6.1 Calls in Arrears
It may happen that shareholders do not pay the call amount on due date. When
any shareholder fails to pay the amount due on allotment or on any of the calls,
such amount is known as ‘Calls in Arrears’/‘Unpaid Calls’. Calls in Arrears
represent the debit balance of all the calls account. Such amount shall appear
as ‘Note to Accounts (Refer Chapter 3). However, where a company maintains
‘Calls in Arrears’ Account, it needs to pass the following additional journal entry:

Calls in Arrears A/c Dr.
To Share First Call Account A/c
To Share Second and Final Call Account A/c

(Calls in arrears brought into account)
The Articles of Association of a company may empower the directors to charge

interest at a stipulated rate on calls in arrears. If the articles are silent in this
regard, the rule contained in Table F shall be applicable which states that the
interest at a rate not exceeding 10% p.a. shall have to be paid on all unpaid
amounts on shares for the period intervening between the day fixed for payment
and the time of actual payment thereof.

On receipt of the call amount together with interest, the amount of interest
shall be credited to interest account while call money shall be credited to the
respective call account or to calls in arrears account. When the shareholder makes
the payment of calls in arrears together with interest, the entry will be as follows:

Bank A/c Dr.
To Calls in Arrears A/c
To Interest on Calls in Arrears A/c

(Calls in arrears received with interest)
Note: If nothing is specified, there is no need to take the interest on calls in arrears

1.6.2 Calls in Advance
Sometimes shareholders pay a part or the whole of the amount of the calls not
yet made. The amount so received from the shareholders is known as “Calls in
Advance”. The amount received in advance is a liability of the company and
should be credited to ‘Call in Advance Account.” The amount received will be
adjusted towards the payment of calls as and when they becomes due. Table F
of the Companies Act provides for the payment of interest on calls in advance at
a rate not exceeding 12% per annum.

The following journal entry is recorded for the amount of calls received in advance.
Bank A/c Dr.

To Calls in Advance A/c
(Amount received on call in advance)

On the due date of the calls, the amount of ‘Calls in Advance’ is adjusted by the
following entry :

Calls in Advance A/c Dr.
To Particular Call A/c

(Calls in advance adjusted with the call money due)

The balance in ‘Calls in Advance’ account is shown as a separate item under the
title Equity and Liabilities in the company’s balance sheet under the head ‘current
liabilities’, as sub-head ‘others current liabilities’. It is not added to the amount of
paid-up capital.

As ‘Calls in Advance’ is a liability of the company, it is under obligation, if
provided by the Articles, to pay interest on such amount from the date of its
receipt up to the date when appropriate call is due for payment. A stipulation is
generally made in the Articles regarding the rate at which interest is payable.
However, if Articles are silent on this account, Table F is applicable which provides
for interest on calls in advance at a rate not exceeding 12% per annum.

1.6.3 Over Subscription
There are instances when applications for more shares of a company are received
than the number offered to the public for subscription. This usually happens in
respect of shares issue of well-managed and financially strong companies and
is said to be a case of ‘Over Subscription’.

In such a condition, three alternatives are available to the directors to deal
with the situation: (1) they can accept some applications in full and totally reject
the others;  (2) they can make a pro-rata allotment to all; and  (3) they can adopt
a combination of the above two alternatives which happens to be the most
common course adopted in practice.

The problem of over subscription is resolved with the allotment of shares.
Therefore, from the accounting point of view, it is better to place the situation of
over subscription within the total frame of application and allotment, i.e. receipt
of application amount, amount due on allotment and its receipt from the
shareholders, and the same has been observed in the pattern of entries.
First Alternative : When the directors decide to fully accept some applications
and totally reject the others, the application money received on rejected
applications is fully refunded. For example, a company invited applications for
20,000 shares and received the applications for 25,000 shares. The directors
rejected the applications for 5,000 shares which are in excess of the required
number and refunded their application money in full. In this case, the journal
entries on application and allotment will be as follows :

The journal entries on application and allotment according to this alternative
are as follows:

1 Bank A/c Dr.
To Share Application A/c

(Money received on application for 25,000
shares @ Rs. _ per share)

2 Share Application A/c Dr.

4 Bank A/c Dr.

Reprint 2025-26



Accounting for Share Capital 25

Second Alternative : When the directors opt to make a proportionate allotment
to all applicants (called ‘pro-rata’ allotment), the excess application money
received is normally adjusted towards the amount due on allotment. In case,
the excess application money received is more than the amount due on allotment
of shares, such excess amount may either be refunded or credited to calls in
advance.

For example, in the event of applications for 20,000 shares being invited
and those received are for 25,000 shares, it is decieded to allot shares in the
ratio of 4:5 to all applicants. It is a case of pro-rata allotment and the excess
application money received on 5,000 shares would be adjusted towards the
amount due on the allotment of 20,000 shares. In this case, the journal
entries on application and allotment will be as follows.

1 Bank A/c Dr.

4 Bank A/c Dr.

Third Alternative : When the application for some shares are rejected outrightly;
and pro-rata allotment is made to the remaining applicants, the money on rejected
applications is refunded and the excess application money received from
applicants to whom pro-rata allotment has been made is adjusted towards the
amount due on the allotment of shares allotted.

For example, a company invited applications for 10,000 shares and received
applications for 15,000 shares. The directors decided to reject the applications
for 2,500 shares outright and to make a pro-rata allotment of 10,000 shares to
the applicants for the remaining 12,500 shares so that four shares are allotted

26 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

for every five shares applied. In this case, the money on applications for 2,500
shares rejected would be refunded fully and that on the remaining 2,500 shares
(12,500 shares – 10,000 shares) would be adjusted against the allotment amount
due on 10,000 shares allotted and credited to share allotment account, the

1.6.4 Under Subscription
Under subscription is a situation where number of shares applied for is less
than the number for which applications have been invited for subscription. For
example, a comapny offered 2 lakh shares for subscription to the public but the
applications were received for 1,90,000 shares, only. In such a situation, the
allotment will be confirmed to 1,90,000 shares and entries shall be made
accordingly. However, as stated earlier, it must be ensured that the company
has received the minimum subscriptions and the company will have to refund
the entire subscription amount received.

1.6.5 Issue of Shares at a Premium
It is quite common for the shares of financially strong and well-managed
companies to be issued at a premium, i.e. at an amount more than the nominal
or par value of shares. Thus, when a share of the nominal value of Rs. 100 is
issued at Rs. 105, it is said to have been issued at a premium of 5 per cent.

When the issue of shares is at a premium, the amount of premium may
technically be called at any stage of the issue of shares. However, premium is
generally called with the amount due on allotment, sometimes with the
application money and rarely with the call money. The premium amount is
credited to a separate account called ‘Securities Premium Account’ and is

1.6.6 Issue of Shares at a Discount
There are instances when the shares of a company are issued at a discount, i.e.
at an amount less than the nominal or par value of shares, the difference between
the nominal value and issue price representing discount on the issue of shares.
For example, when a share of the nominal value of Rs. 100 is issued at Rs. 98, it
is said to have been issued at a discount of two per cent.

As a general rule, a company cannot ordinarily issue shares at a discount. It
can do so only in cases such as ‘reissue of forfeited shares’ (to be discussed later)
and issue of sweat equity shares.

1.6.7 Issue of Shares for Consideration other than Cash
There are instances where a company enters into an arrangement with the
vendors from whom it has purchased assets, whereby the latter agrees to accept,
the payment in the form of fully paid shares of the company issued to them.
Normally, no such cash is received for issue of shares. These shares can also be
issued either at par, at premium or at discount, and the number of shares to be
issued  will depend upon the price at which the shares are issued and the amount
payable to the vendor.  The number of shares to be issued to the vendor will be
calculated as follows:

Number of shares to be issued= Amount Payable
    Issue Price

For example, Rahul Limited purchased building from Handa Limited for
Rs.5,40,000 and the payment is to be made by the issue of shares of Rs.100
each. The number of shares to be issued shall be worked out as follows in different
situations:

 (a)    When shares are issued at par, i.e., at Rs.100
Amount Payable

      Number of shares to be issued =
  Issue Price
Rs. 5,40,000

=
Rs. 100

= 5,400  shares

 (b)  When shares issued at premium of 20%, i.e., at Rs. 120 (100 + 20)
Amount Payable

    Number of shares to be issued =
  Issue Price

Rs. 5,40,000
=

Rs. 120
= 4,500  shares

1.7 Forfeiture of Shares

It may happen that some shareholders fail to pay one or more instalments,
viz. allotment money and/or call money. In such circumstances, the company
can forfeit their shares, i.e. cancel their allotment and treat the amount already
received thereon as forfeited to the company within the framework of the
provisions in its articles. These provisions are usually based on  Table F
which authorise the directors to forefeit the shares for non-payment of calls
made. For this purpose, they have to strictly follow the procedure laid down
in this regard. Following is the accounting treatment of shares issued at par,
premium or at a discount. When shares are forefeited all entries relating to
the shares forfeited except those relating to premium, already recorded in
the accounting records must be reversed. Accordingly, share capital account
is debited with the amount called-up in respect of shares are forfeited and
crediting the respective unpaid calls accounts’s or calls in arrears account
with the amount already received. Thus, the journal entry will be as follows:

(a) Forfeiture of Shares issued at Par:
Share Capital A/c..........(Called up amount) Dr.

To Share Forfeiture A/c...........(Paid up amount)
To Share Allotment A/c
To Share Calls A/c (individually)

(..... shares forfeited for non-payment of
allotment money and calls made)

Reprint 2025-26



38 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

It may be noted here that when the shares are forfeited, all entries relating to the
forfeited shares must be reversed except the entry relating to share premium received, if
any. Accordingly, the share capital is debited to the extent to called-up capital and credited
to (i) respective unpaid calls account i.e., calls in arrears and (ii) share forfeiture account
with the amount already received on shares.

The balance of shares forfeited account is shown as an addition to the total
paid-up capital of the company under the head ‘Share Capital’ under title
‘Equity and Liabilities’ of the Balance Sheet till the forfeited shares are reissued.

Forfeiture of Shares issued at a Premium: If shares were initially issued at a
premium and the premium amount has been fully realised, but some of the
shares are forfeited due to non-payment of call money, the accounting treatment
for forfeiture shall be on the same pattern as in the case of shares issued at par.
The important point to be noted in this context is that the securities premium
account is not to be debited at the time of forfeiture if the premium has been
received in respect of the forefeited shares and the amount of forfeiture shall be
excluding premium amount.

In case, however, if the premium amount has not been received, either wholly
or partially, in respect of the shares forfeited, the Securities Premium Reserve
Account will also be debited with the amount of premium not received along
with the Share Capital Account at the time forfeiture. This will usually be the
case when even the amount due on allotment has not been received. Thus, the
journal entry to record the forfeiture of shares issued at a premium on which
premium has not been fully received, will be :

Note : Premium amount on Jagdale’s shares will not be taken into account as it has
been received in full by the company.

1.7.1 Reissue of Forfeited Shares
The directors can either cancel or re-issue the forefeited shares. In most cases,
they reissue such shares which may be at par, at premium or at a discount.
Forfeited shares may be reissued as fully paid at a par, premium, discount. In
this context, it may be noted that the amount of discount allowed cannot exceed
the amount that had been received on forfeited shares at the time of initial issue,
and that the discount allowed on reissue of forfeited shares should be debited to
the ‘Forfeited Share Account’. The balance, if any, left in the Share-Forfeited
Account relating to reissued Shares, should be treated as capital profit and
transferred to Capital Reserve Account. For example, when a company forfeits
200 shares of Rs. 10 each on which Rs. 600 had been received, it can allow a
maximum discount of Rs. 600 on their reissue. Assuming that the company
reissues these shares for Rs. 1,800 as fully paid, the necessary journal entry
will be:

Bank A/c Dr. 1,800
Share Forfeiture A/c Dr. 200

To Share Capital A/c 2,000
(Reissue of 200 forfeited shares at Rs. 9 per
share as fully paid)

This shall leave a balance of Rs. 400 in share forfeited account which should
be transferred to Capital Reserve Account by recording the following journal
entry:

Share Forfeiture A/c Dr. 400
To Capital Reserve 400

(Profit on reissue of forfeited shares
transferred)

Reprint 2025-26



50 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

Another important point to be noted in this context is that the capital profit
arises only in respect of the forefited share reissued, and not on all forefeited shares.
Hence, when a part of the forfeited shares are reissued, the whole balance of share
forfeiture account cannot be transferred to the capital reserve. In such a situation,
it is only the proportionate amount of balance that relates to the forefeited shares
reissued which should be transferred to capital reserve, ensuring that the
remaining balance in share forefeiture account is proportionate to the amount
forefeited on shares not yet reissued.

Therefore,  refund of application money = (3,17,000 – 2,86,000) × Rs. 2.50

(2,00,000 shares @ Rs. 2.50)
Excess application money Rs. 2,15,000

2. Amount of Calls in Advance
As two allotees, each holding 4,000 shares, paid the full amount on allotment, amount
of calls-in-advance is thus :
8,000 shares × (Rs. 2.50 + Rs. 2.50) = Rs. 40,000

Buy-back of Shares : When a company purchase its own shares, it is called
‘Buy-back of Shares’. Section 68 of The Companies Act, 2013 provides that the

(b) Open Market
(c) Odd-lot shareholders
(d) Employees of the company

The company can buy back its own shares either from the free reserves, securities
premium or from the proceeds of any shares or other specified securities. In case
shares are bought back out of free reserves, the company must transfer a sum equal
to the nominal value of shares bought back to ‘Capital Redemption Reserve Account’.

The following procedures have been laid down for buy back of shares :
(a) The Articles of the Association must authorise the company for the buy back

of shares.
(b) A special resolution must be passed in the companies’ Annual General Body

meeting.
(c) The amount of buy back of shares in any financial year should not exceed

25% of the paid-up capital and free reserves.
(d) The debt-equity ratio should not be more than a ratio of 2:1 after the buy

back.
(e) All the shares of buy back should be fully paid-up.
(f) The buy-back of the shares should be completed within 12 months from

the date of passing the special resolution.
(g) The company should file a solvency declaration with the Registrar and SEBI

which must be signed by at least two directors of the company.

Summary

Company: An organisation consisting of individuals called ‘shareholders’ by virtue
of their holding the shares of a company, who can act as legal person as regards
its business through board of directors.
Share: Fractional part of the capital, and forms the basis of ownership in a company.
Shares are generally of two types, viz. equity shares and preference shares,
according to the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. Preference shares again
are of different types based on varying shades of rights attached to them.

Share Capital of a company is collected by issuing shares to either a select
group of persons through the route of private placements and/or offered to the
public for subscription. Thus, the issue of shares is basic to the capital of a
company. Shares are issued either for cash or for consideration other than
cash, the former being more common. Shares are said to be issued for
consideration other than cash when a company purchases business, or some
asset/assets, and the vendors have agreed to receive payment in the form of
fully paid shares of a company.
Stages of Share Issue: The issue of shares for cash is required to be made in strict
conformity with the procedure laid down by law for the same. When shares are
issued for cash, the amount on them can be collected at one or more of the following
stages:

(i) Application for shares
(ii) Allotment of shares
(iii) Call/Calls on shares.

Reprint 2025-26



66 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

Calls in Arrears: Sometimes, the full amount called on allotment and/or call (calls)
is not received from the allottees/shareholders. The amount not so received are
cumulatively called ‘Unpaid calls’ or ‘Calls in Arrears’. However, it is not mandatory
for a company to maintain a separate Calls-in-Arrears Account. There are also
instances where some shareholders consider it discreet to pay a part or whole of
the amount not yet called-up on the shares allotted to them. Any amount paid by
a shareholder in the excess of the amount due from him on allotment/call (calls) is
known as ‘Calls in Advance’ for which a separate account is maintained. A company
has the power to charge interest on calls in  arrears and is under an obligation to
pay interest on calls-in-advance if it accepts them in accordance with the provisions
of Articles of Association.
Over Subscription: It is possible for the shares of some companies to be over
subscribed which means that applications for more shares are received than the
number offered for subscription.

If the amount of minimum subscription is not received to the extent of 90%, the
issue dissolves. In case the applications received are less than the number of
shares offered to the public, the issue is termed as ‘under subscribed’.
Issue of Shares at Premium: Irrespective of the fact that shares have been issued
for consideration other than cash, they can be issued either at par or at premium.
The issue of shares at par implies that the shares have been issued for an amount
exactly equal to their face or nominal value. In case shares are issued  at a premium,
i.e. at an amount more than the nominal or par value of shares, the amount of
premium is credited to a separate account called ‘Securities Premium Reserve
Account’, the use of which is strictly regulated by law.
Issue of Shares at Discount: Shares can as well be issued at a discount, i.e. for an
amount less than the nominal or par value of shares provided the company fully
complies with the provisions laid down by law with regard to the same. Apart from
such compliance, shares of a company cannot ordinarily be issued at a discount.
According to the Companies Act, 2013, only sweat equity shares can be issued at
a discount. When shares are issued at a discount, the amount of discount is debited
to ‘Discount on Issue of Share Account’, which is in the nature of capital loss for
the company.
Forfeiture of Shares: Sometimes, shareholders fail to pay one or more instalments
on shares allotted to them. In such a case, the company has the authority to
forfeit shares of the defaulters. This is called ‘Forfeiture of Shares’. Forfeiture
means the cancellation of allotment due to breach of contract and to treat the
amount already received on such shares as forfeited to the company. The precise
accounting treatment of share forfeiture depends upon the conditions on which
the shares have been issued — at par, premium or discount. Generally speaking,
accounting treatment on forfeiture is to reverse the entries passed till the stage
of forfeiture, the amount already received on the shares being credited to Forfeiture
Shares Account.

Reprint 2025-26



Accounting for Share Capital 67

Reissue of Shares: The management of a company is vested with the power to
reissue the shares once forfeited by it, subject of course, to the terms and
conditions in the articles of association relating to the same. The shares can be
reissued even at a discount provided the amount of discount allowed does not
exceed the credit balance of Share forfeiture account relating to shares being
reissued. Therefore, discount allowed on the reissue of forfeited shares is debited
to Share forfeiture account.

Once all the forfeited shares have been reissued, any credit balance on
Share forfeiture account is transferred to Capital Reserve representing profit
on forfeiture of shares. In the event of all forfeited share not being reissued, the
credit amount on Share forfeiture account relating to shares yet to be reissued
is carried forward and the remaining balance on the account only is credited to
capital reserve account.

76 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

Bond:  Bond is also an instrument of acknowledgement of debt. Traditionally,
the Government issued bonds, but these days, bonds are also being issued by
semi-government and non-governmental organisations. The terms ‘debentures’
and ‘Bonds’ are now being used inter-changeably.

2.2 Distinction between Shares and Debentures

Ownership: A ‘share’ represents ownership of the company whereas a debenture
is only acknowledgement of Debt. A share is a part of the owned capital whereas
a debenture is a part of borrowed capital.
Return: The return on shares is known as dividend while the return on
debentures is called interest. The rate of return on shares may vary from year to
year depending upon the profits of the company but the rate of interest on
debentures is prefixed. The payment of dividend is an appropriation of profits,
whereas the payment of interest is a charge on profits and is to be paid even if
there is no profit.
Repayment:  Normally, the amount of shares is not returned during the life of
the company, whereas, generally, the debentures are issued for a specified period
and repayable on the expiry of that period.
Voting Rights:  Shareholders enjoy voting rights whereas debentureholders do
not normally enjoy any voting right.
Security :  Shares are not secured by any charge whereas the debentures are
generally secured and carry a fixed or floating charge over the assets of the
company.
Convertibility:  Shares cannot be converted into debentures whereas debentures
can be converted into shares if the terms of issue so provide, and in that case
these are known as convertible debentures.

2.3 Types of Debentures

A company may issue different kinds of debentures which can be classified as
under:

2.3.1 From the Point of view of Security
(a) Secured Debentures: Secured debentures refer to those debentures

where a charge is created on the assets of the company for the purpose
of payment in case of default. The charge may be fixed or floating.  A
fixed charge is created on a specific asset whereas a floating charge is

Reprint 2025-26



Issue and Redemption of Debentures 77

on the general assets of the company. The fixed charge is created
against those assets which are held by a company for use in operations
not meant for sale whereas floating charge involves all assets excluding
those assigned to the secured creditors.

(b) Unsecured Debentures: Unsecured debentures do not have a specific
charge on the assets of the company. However, a floating charge may
be created on these debentures by default. Normally, these kinds of
debentures are not issued.

2.3.2 From the Point of view of Tenure
(a) Redeemable Debentures: Redeemable debentures are those which

are payable on the expiry of the specific period either in lump sum
or in Instalments during the life time of the company. Debentures
can be redeemed either at par or at premium.

(b) Irredeemable Debentures: Irredeemable debentures are also known
as Perpetual Debentures because the company does not give any
undertaking for the repayment of money borrowed by issuing such
debentures.  These debentures are repayable on the winding-up of a
company or on the expiry of a long period.

2.3.3 From the Point of view of Convertibility
(a) Convertible Debentures: Debentures which are convertible into equity

shares or in any other security either at the option of the company or
the debentureholders are called convertible debentures. These
debentures are either fully convertible or partly convertible.

(b) Non-Convertible Debentures: The debentures which cannot be
converted into shares or in any other securities are called non-
convertible debentures. Most debentures issued by companies fall in
this category.

2.3.4 From Coupon Rate Point of view
(a) Specific Coupon Rate Debentures: These debentures are issued with

a specified rate of interest, which is called the coupon rate. The specified
rate may either be fixed or floating. The floating interest rate is usually
tagged with the bank rate.

(b) Zero Coupon Rate Debentures: These debentures do not carry a
specific rate of interest. In order to compensate the investors, such
debentures are issued at substantial discount and the difference
between the nominal value and the issue price is treated as the
amount of interest related to the duration of the debentures.

78 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

2.3.5 From the view Point of Registration

(a) Registered Debentures: Registered debentures are those debentures
in respect of which all details including names, addresses and
particulars of holding of the debentureholders are entered in a register
kept by the company. Such debentures can be transferred only by
executing a regular transfer deed.

(b) Bearer Debentures: Bearer debentures are the debentures which can
be transferred by way of delivery and the company does not keep
any record of the debentures Interest on debentures is paid to a
person who produces the interest coupon attached to such
debentures.

2.4 Issue of Debentures

The procedure for the issue of debentures is the same as that for the issue of
shares. The intending investors apply for debentures on the basis of the prospectus
issued by the company. The company may either ask for the entire amount to be
paid on application or by means of instalments on application, on allotment and
on various calls. Debentures can be issued at par, at a premium or at a discount.
They can also be issued for consideration other than cash or as a collateral
security.

2.4.2 Issue of Debentures at a Discount
When a debenture is issued at a price below its nominal value, it is said to be
issued at a discount. For example, the issue of Rs. 100 debentures at Rs. 95,
Rs. 5 being the amount of discount. The discount on issue of debentures can
be written off either by debiting it to or out of Securities Premium Reserve, if
any, during the life time of debentures.

balance sheet date or the period of operating cycle is shown under ‘Other
Current Assets’ and the part which is to be written off after 12 months of

When the number of debentures applied for is more than the number of
debentures offered to the public, the issue is said to be over subscribed. A
company, however, cannot allot more debentures than it has invited for
subscription. The excess money received on over subscription may, however, be
retained for adjustment towards allotment and the respective calls to be made.
But the money received from applicants to whom no debentures have been
allotted, will be refunded to them.

2.7 Issue of Debentures as a Collateral Security
A collateral security may be defined as a subsidiary or secondary or additional
security besides the primary security when a company obtains a loan or
overdraft from a bank or any other financial Institution. It may pledge or
mortgage some assets as a secured loan against the said loan. But the lending

Reprint 2025-26



94 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

institutions may insist on additional assets as collateral security so that the
amount of loan can be realised in full with the help of collateral security in
case the amount from the sale of principal security falls short of the loan
money. In such situation, the company may issue its own debentures to the
lenders in addition to some other assets already pledged. Such an issue of
debentures is known as ‘Debentures issued as Collateral Security’.

If the company fails to repay the loan along with interest, the lender is free to
receive his money from the sale of primary security and if the realisable value of
the primary security falls short to cover the entire amount, the lender has the
right to invoke the benefit of collateral security whereby debentures may either
be presented for redemption or sold in the open market.

Debentures issued as collateral security can be dealt within two ways in the
books of the company:

First Method
No entry is made in the books of accounts since no liability is created by such
issue. However, on the liability side of the balance sheet, below the item of loan,
a note to the effect that it has been secured by issue of debentures as a collateral
security is appended. For example, X Company has issued 9%, 10,000
debentures of Rs.100 each for a loan of Rs.10, 00,000 taken from a bank.  This
fact may be shown in the balance sheet as under:

2.8 Terms of Issue of Debentures

When a company issues debentures, it usually mentions the terms on which
they will be redeemed on their maturity. Redemption of debentures means
discharge of liability on account of debentures by repayment made to the
debenture holders.  Debentures can be redeemed either at par or at a premium.

Depending upon the terms and conditions of issue and redemption of
debentures, the following six situations are commonly found in practice.

(i) Issued at par and redeemable at par

(ii) Issued at discount and redeemable at par

(iii) Issued at a premium and redeemable at par

2.9 Interest  on  Debentures

When a company issues debentures, it is under an obligation to pay interest thereon
at fixed percentage (half yearly) periodically until debentures are repaid. This
percentage is usually as part of the name of debentures like 8% debentures, 10%
debentures, etc., and interest payable is calculated at the nominal value of
debentures.

Interest on debenture is a charge against the profit of the company and
must be paid whether the company has earned any profit or not. According
to Income Tax Act, 1961, a company must deduct income tax at a prescribed
rate from the interest payable on debentures if it exceeds the prescribed
limit. It is called Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and is to be deposited with
the tax authorities. Of course, the debentureholders can adjust this amount
against the tax due from them.

SECTION  II

2.11 Redemption of Debentures

Redemption of debentures refers to extinguishing or discharging the liability on
account of debentures in accordance with the terms of issue. In other words
redemption of debentures means repayment of the amount of debentures by
the company. There are four ways by which the debentures can be redeemed.
These are :
1. Payment in lump sum
2. Payment in instalments
3. Purchase in the open market
4. By conversion into shares or new debentures.

Methods of Redemption of Debentures

Payment in Payment in Purchase in Conversion  into Shares
Lump sum Instalments Open Market or New Debentures

Payment in lump sum :  The company redeems the debentures by paying the
amount in lump sum to the debentureholders at the maturity thereof as per
terms of issue.
Payment in instalments :  Under this method, normally redemption of
debentures is made in instalments on the specified date during the tenure of
the debentures.  The total amount of debenture liability is divided by the
number of years. It is to note that the actual debentures redeemable are
identified by means of drawing the requisite number of lots out of the debentures
outstanding for payment.
Purchase in open market:  When a  company purchases its own debentures
for the purposes of cancellation, such an act of purchasing and cancelling the
debentures constitutes redemption of debentures by purchase in the open
market.

Conversion into shares or new debentures : A company can redeem its
debentures by converting them into shares or new class of debentures. If
debentureholders find that the offer is beneficial to them, they can exercise their
right of converting their debentures into shares or new class of debentures.

Issue and Redemption of Debentures 111

These new shares or debentures can be issued at par, at a discount or at a
premium. It should be noted that only the actual proceeds of debentures are to
be taken into account for ascertaining the number of shares to be issued in lieu
of the debentures to be converted.  If debentures were originally issued at
discount, the actual amount realised from them at the time of issue would be
used as the basis for computing the actual number of shares to be issued. It
may be noted that this method is applicable only to convertible debentures.

The following factors should be taken into consideration by the company at
the time of redemption of debentures :

1. Time of redemption of debentures :- Generally, debentures are
redeemed on due date but a company may redeem its debentures before
maturity date, if its articles provides for such.

2. Sources of Redemption of debentures :- A company may source its
redemption of debentures either out of capital or out of profits.

As per the Act, all India financial institutions registered by Reserve Bank of
India, banking companies, NFBCs registered with Reserve bank of India, Housing
Finance companies registered to the National Housing bank and the companies
listed on stock exchange and unlisted companies are exempted from creating
Debenture Redemption Reserve and may redeem debentures out of capital.
Whereas for "other unlisted companies", the adequacy of Debenture Redemption
Reserve shall be ten percent of the value of the outstanding debentures.

However companies are required to invest or deposit a sum on or before
April 30 which shall not be less than 15% of the amount of debentures maturing
during the year ending on March 31 of the next year in anyone or more methods
of investments or deposits given below:

(i) Deposit with any scheduled bank, free from any charge or line;
(ii) Securities of the Central Government or of any State Government;
(iii) Securities mentioned in sub clauses (a) to (d) and (ee) of section 20 of

the Indian Trusts Act, 1982;
(iv) Bonds issued by any other company which is notified under sub-

clause (f) of section 20 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1982;
(v) The amount invested or deposited as above shall not be used for any

purpose other than for redemption of debentures maturing during
the year referred above;

In case the debentures are redeemed in lump sum a company will invest
15% of the of the value of debentures. However, if the debentures are to be
redeemed in installment, over a period, investment shall not be realised but
carried forward to meet the requirement of debenture Redemption Investment

for the next redemption. It must be at least 15% of the value of the debentures
to be redeemed in the next year. However, if debenture redemption investment is
more or less than 15% of the value of debentures to be redeemed, Debenture
Redemption Investment shall be realised to the extent they are excess and further
amount shall be invested to meet the shortfall in the investment. For example,
Kays Ltd. has 10,000, 60% debentures to be redeemed as follows:

On January 31, 2017 2,000 Debentures
January 31, 2018 3,000
January 31 , 2019 3,000
January 31 , 2020 2,000

The amount will be invested or realised during the above 4 years as:

(i) Kays Ltd., will invest Rs. 30,000 on or before April 30, 2016 for
redemption of 2,000 debentures on January 31, 2017.

(ii) It will further invest Rs. 15,000 on or before April 30, 2017 to make
the investment equal to Rs. 15,000 on or before April 30, 2017 to
make the investment equal to Rs. 45,000, i.e., 15% of Rs. 3,00,000
the debentures to be redeemed on January 31, 2018.

(iii) Investment in debenture redemption as on April 20, 2018 will be Rs.
45,000 which meets the criteria of investment being 15% of
debentures (Rs. 3,00,000) to be redeemed during the year. At the
time of redemption of debentures on January 31, 2019 it will realise
debentures redemption investments of Rs, 15,000. After realisation
of investments, balance investments will be Rs. 30,000 which is equal
to 15% Rs. 200,000.

(iv) At the time of redemption of 2,000 debentures on January 31, 2020
all the investments will be realised.

2.13 Redemption by Purchase in Open Market
When a company purchases its own debentures in the open market for the
purpose of immediate cancellation, the purchase and cancellation of such
debentures are termed as redemption by purchase in the open market. The
advantage of such an option is that a company can redeem the debentures at its
convenience whenever it has surplus funds. Secondly, the company can purchase
them when they are available in market at a discount.

When the debentures are purchased from the market at a discount and
cancelled, the journal entries are recorded as follows :
1. On purchase of own debentures for immediate cancellation

To Bank A/c
To Profit on Redemption of Debentures A/c

2. On transfer of Profit on Redemption

In case, the debentures are purchased from the market at a price which is above
the nominal value of debenture, the excess will be debited to loss on redemption
of debentures. The journal entry in that case will be

Summary

Debenture: Debenture is the acknowledgements of debt. It is a loan capital raised by the
company from general public. A person/holder of such a written acknowledgement is called
‘debenture holder’.
Bond: Bond is similar to debenture in terms of contents and texture. The only difference is
with respect of issue condition, i.e, bonds can be issued without pre-determined rate of
interest as it is in case of deep discount bonds.
Charge: Charge is an incumbrance to meet the obligation under trust deed on certain
assets which company agrees to mortgage either by way of first or second charge. First
charge implies the priority in repayment of loan. Those who hold first charge against any
specific asset will realise their claim from the net realisable value of such assets. Any
amount of surplus from such assets given under first charge will be utilised for setting the
claims for holder of second charge.
Types of Debenture: Debentures are of various types such as: secured and unsecured
debentures redeemable and perpetual debentures, convertible and non-convertible
debentures, zero coupon rate and specific rate, registered and bearer debentures.
Issue of Debenture: Debentures are said to be issued at par when the amount to be collected
on them is equal to their nominal or face value. If the issue price is more than nominal or
face value, it is said to be issued at a premium. If the issue price is less than the nominal
or face value, it is said to be issued on discount. The amount received as premium is
credited to ‘securities premium account’ whereas amount of discount allowed is debited to
“loss/discount on issue” and is written-off over the years
Issue of Debentures for consideration other than Cash: Sometimes debentures can be issued
to vendor or suppliers of patents, copyrights and for transfer of intellectual property rights
on preferential basis without receiving money in cash.
Purchase Consideration: Purchase consideration is amount paid by purchasing company in
consideration for purchase of assets/business firm, another enterprise/vendor.
Collateral Security: Any security in addition to primary security is called ‘collateral security’.
Redemption of Debenture: Means discharge of liability on account of debenture/bond by
repayment made to debenture holders Normally, the redemption takes place on the expiry of
period for which they have been issued, depending upon the terms and conditions of issue.

3.2 Nature of Financial Statements

The chronologically recorded facts about events expressed in monetary terms
for a defined period of time are the basis for the preparation of periodical financial
statements which reveal the financial position as on a date and the financial
results obtained during a period. The American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants states the nature of financial statements as, “the statements
prepared for the purpose of presenting a periodical review of report on progress
by the management and deal with the status of investment in the business and
the results achieved during the period under review. They reflect a combination
of recorded facts, accounting principles and personal judgements”.

The following points explain the nature of financial statements:
1. Recorded Facts: Financial statements are prepared on the basis of

facts in the form of cost data recorded in accounting books. The original
cost or historical cost is the basis of recording transactions. The figures
of various accounts such as cash in hand, cash at bank, trade
receivables, fixed assets, etc., are taken as per the figures recorded in
the accounting books. The assets purchased at different times and at
different prices are put together and shown at costs. As these are not
based on market prices, the financial statements do not show current
financial condition of the concern.

2. Accounting Conventions: Certain accounting conventions are followed
while preparing financial statements. The convention of valuing
inventory at cost or market price, whichever is lower, is followed. The
valuing of assets at cost less depreciation principle for balance sheet
purposes is followed. The convention of materiality is followed in dealing
with small items like pencils, pens, postage stamps, etc. These items
are treated as expenditure in the year in which they are purchased
even though they are assets in nature. The stationery is valued at cost
and not on the principle of cost or market price, whichever is less. The
use of accounting conventions makes financial statements comparable,
simple and realistic.

3. Postulates: Financial statements are prepared on certain basic
assumptions (pre-requisites) known as postulates such as going
concern postulate, money measurement postulate, realisation
postulate, etc. Going concern postulate assumes that the enterprise is
treated as a going concern and exists for a longer period of time. So the
assets are shown on historical cost basis. Money measurement
postulate assumes that the value of money will remain the same in
different periods. Though there is drastic change in purchasing power
of money, the assets purchased at different times will be shown at

the amount paid for them. While, preparing statement of profit and
loss the revenue is included in the sales of the year in which the sale
was undertaken even though the sale price may be received over a
number of years. The assumption is known as realisation postulate.

4. Personal Judgements: Under more than one circumstance, facts and
figures presented through financial statements are based on personal
opinion, estimates and judgements. The depreciation is provided taking
into consideration the useful economic life of fixed assets. Provisions
for doubtful debts are made on estimates and personal judgements.
In valuing inventory, cost or market value, whichever is less is being
followed. While deciding either cost of inventory or market value of
inventory, many personal judgements are to be made based on certain
considerations. Personal opinion, judgements and estimates are made
while preparing the financial statements to avoid any possibility of
over statement of assets and liabilities, income and expenditure,
keeping in mind the convention of conservatism.

Thus, financial statements are the summarised reports of recorded facts
and are prepared the following accounting concepts, conventions, accounting
policies, accounting standards and requirements of Law.

3.3 Objectives of Financial Statements
Financial statements are the basic sources of information to the shareholders
and other external parties for understanding the profitability and financial
position of any business concern. They provide information about the results of
the business concern during a specified period of time in terms of assets and
liabilities, which provide the basis for taking decisions. Thus, the primary
objective of financial statements is to assist the users in their decision-making.
The specific objectives include the following:

1. To provide information about economic resources and obligations of
a business: They are prepared to provide adequate, reliable and
periodical information about economic resources and obligations of a
business firm to investors and other external parties who have limited
authority, ability or resources to obtain information.

2. To provide information about the earning capacity of the business:
They are to provide useful financial information which can gainfully
be utilised to predict, compare and evaluate the business firm’s earning
capacity.

3. To provide information about cash flows: They are to provide
information useful to investors and creditors for predicting, comparing
and evaluating, potential cash flows in terms of amount, timing and
related uncertainties.

Reprint 2025-26



Financial Statements of a Company 147

4. To judge effectiveness of management: They supply information useful
for judging management’s ability to utilise the resources of a business
effectively.

5. Information about activities of business affecting the society: They
have to report the activities of the business organisation affecting the
society, which can be determined and described or measured and which
are important in its social environment.

6. Disclosing accounting policies: These reports have to provide the
significant policies, concepts followed in the process of accounting and
changes taken up in them during the year to understand these
statements in a better way.

3.4 Types of Financial Statements

The financial statements generally include two statements: balance sheet and
statement of profit and loss which are required for external reporting and also
for internal needs of the management like planning, decision-making and
control. Apart from these, there is also a need to know about movements of
funds and changes in the financial position of the company. For this purpose,
a cash flow statement is prepard.

Every company registered under The Companies Act 2013 shall prepare
its balance sheet, statement of profit and loss and notes to account thereto in
accordance with the manner prescribed in the revised Schedule III to the
Companies Act, 2013 to harmonise the disclosure requirement with the
accounting standards and to converge with new reforms.

 is expected to be realised/settled within twelve months or,
 if it is held primarily for trading or,
 is cash and cash equivalent or,
 if entity does not have on unconditional rights to defer settlement of

Important points:
 Preliminary expenses are to be written-off completely in the year in which

such expenses are incurred. They should be written-off first from
securities premium and the balance if any, from statement of profit &
loss.

 Borrowing costs such as discount on issue of debentures should be
written-off in the same year in which debuntures are issued.

Share application money pending allotment
Share application money not exceeding the issued capital and to the extent
non-refundable shall be classified as non-current. It will be shown on this face
of balance sheet as share application money pending allotment.

Borrowings
Total borrowings are categorised into long-term borrowings, short-term
borrowings and current maturities to long-term debt.

(i) Loans which are repayable in more than twelve months/operating cycle
are classified as long-term borrowings on the face of balance sheet.

(ii) Loans repayable on demand or whose original tenure is not more than
twelve months/operating cycle are classified as short-term borrowings
on the face of balance sheet.

Reprint 2025-26



Financial Statements of a Company 155

(iii) Current maturities to long-term loan include amount repayable within
twelve months/operating cycle under other current liabilities with Note
to Account.

Deferred tax assets/liabilities are always non-current. This is in accordance
with Schedule III of the Companies Act.

Trade payables
Sundry creditors have been replaced with the term Trade payables and are
classified as current and non-current. Trade payables to be settled beyond 12
months from the date of balance sheet or beyond the operating cycle are classified
under “other long-term liabilities” with Note to Account. For example, purchase
of goods and services in normal course of business. The balance of trade payables
are classified as current liabilities on the face of balance sheet.

Proposed Dividend
Proposed dividend is proposed by the Board of Directors and declared
(approved) by the shareholders in their Annual General Meeting. Board of
Directors propose the dividend after the annual accounts for the year have
been prepared. Annual General Meeting of the shareholders is held thereafter
meaning it is held in the next financial year.
Shareholders may reduce the amount of proposed dividend but cannot increase
it. Since declaration of proposed (final) dividend is contingent upon
shareholders approval, Proposed dividend is shown as contingent liability.
AS-4, Contingencies and Events Occurring after the Balance Sheet Date
prescribes that proposed dividend will be shown in the Notes to Accounts.
After the Proposed dividend is declared by the shareholders, it becomes a
liability for the company and is accounted in the books. As a consequence,
proposed dividend of previous year will be declared (approved) by the
shareholders in the current year and this declared (approved) proposed dividend
will be accounted during the year. Proposed dividend for the current year will
be relevant for the next financial year.
Briefly, proposed dividend of previous year will be accounted in the current
year after it is declared (approved) by the shareholders in their annual general
meeting.

Provisions
The amount of provision settled within 12 months from balance sheet date or
within operating cycle period from date of its recognition is classified as short
term provisions and shown under current liabilities on the face of balance
sheet. Others are depicted as long-term provisions under non-current liabilities
on the face of balance sheet.

assets are non-current. This may also be noted if the useful life of the asset is
less than 12 months, it will still fall under non-current.

Inventories
All inventories are always treated as current.

Trade receivables
Trade receivables realised beyond twelve months from reporting date/
operating cycle starting from the date of their recognition are classified as
“Other non-current assets” under the head non-current assets with Note to
Accounts. For example, sale of goods or services rendered in normal course
of business. Others are classified as current assets and shown on the face
of the balance sheet.

3.5 Uses and Importance of Financial Statements

The users of financial statements include management, investors, shareholders,
creditors, government, bankers, employees and public at large. Financial
statements provide the necessary information about the performance of the
management to these parties interested in the organisation and help in taking
appropriate economic decisions. It may be noted that the financial statements
constitute an integral part of the annual report of the company in addition to
the directors report, auditors report, corporate governance report, and
management discussion and analysis.

The various uses and importance of financial statements are as follows:
1. Report on stewardship function: Financial statements report the

performance of the management to the shareholders. The gaps between
the management performance and ownership expectations can be
understood with the help of financial statements.

2. Basis for fiscal policies: The fiscal policies, particularly taxation policies
of the government, are related with the financial performance of
corporate undertakings. The financial statements provide basic input
for industrial, taxation and other economic policies of the government.

Reprint 2025-26



Financial Statements of a Company 165

3. Basis for granting of credit: Corporate undertakings have to borrow
funds from banks and other financial institutions for different purposes.
Credit granting institutions take decisions based on the financial
performance of the undertakings. Thus, financial statements form
the basis for granting of credit.

4. Basis for prospective investors: The investors include both short-term
and long-term investors. Their prime considerations in their investment
decisions are security and liquidity of their investment with reasonable
profitability. Financial statements help the investors to assess long-
term and short-term solvency as well as the profitability of the
concern.

5. Guide to the value of the investment already made: Shareholders of
companies are interested in knowing the status, safety and return on
their investment. They may also need information to take decision
about continuation or discontinuation of their investment in the
business. Financial statements provide information to the shareholders
in taking such important decisions.

6. Aids trade associations in helping their members: Trade associations
may analyse the financial statements for the purpose of providing
service and protection to their members. They may develop standard
ratios and design uniform system of accounts.

7. Helps stock exchanges: Financial statements help the stock exchanges
to understand the extent of transparency in reporting on financial
performance and enables them to call for required information to protect
the interest of investors. The financial statements enable the Stock
brokers to judge the financial position of different concerns and take
decisions about the prices to be quoted.

3.6 Limitations of Financial Statements

Though utmost care is taken in the preparation of the financial statements
and provide detailed information to the users, they suffer from the following
limitations:

1. Do not reflect current situation: Financial statements are prepared
on the basis of historical cost. Since the purchasing power of money
is changing, the values of assets and liabilities shown in financial
statement do not reflect current market situation.

2. Assets may not realise: Accounting is done on the basis of certain
conventions. Some of the assets may not realise the stated values, if
the liquidation is forced on the company. Assets shown in the balance
sheet reflect merely unexpired or unamortised cost.

Reprint 2025-26



166 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

3. Bias: Financial statements are the outcome of recorded facts,
accounting concepts and conventions used and personal judgements
made in different situations by the accountants. Hence, bias may be
observed in the results, and the financial position depicted in financial
statements may not be realistic.

4. Aggregate information: Financial statements show aggregate
information but not detailed information. Hence, they may not help
the users in decision-making much.

5. Vital information missing: Balance sheet does not disclose information
relating to loss of markets, and cessation of agreements, which have
vital bearing on the enterprise.

6. No qualitative information: Financial statements contain only
monetary information but not qualitative information like industrial
relations, industrial climate, labour relations, quality of work, etc.

7. They are only interim reports: Statement of Profit and Loss discloses

sheet dates.
Significance of Financial Statements: The users of financial statements include
Shareholders, Investors, Creditors, Lenders, Customers, Management, Government,

provide data about general purpose needs of these members.
Limitations of Financial Statements: Financial statements are not free from
limitations. They provide only aggregate information to satisfy the general purpose
needs of the users. They are technical statements understood by only persons
having some accounting knowledge. They reflect historical information but not
current situation, which is essential in any decision making. In addition, one can
get idea about the organisation’s performance in terms of quantitative changes but
not in qualitative terms like labour relations, quality of work, employees satisfaction,
etc. The financial statements are neither complete nor accurate as the flow of
income and expenses are segregated using best judgement apart from accepted
concepts. Hence, these statements need proper analysis before their use in decision-
making.

Analysis of Financial Statements 4

You have learnt about the  financial statements
    (Income Statement and Balance Sheet) of
companies. Basically, these are summarised
financial reports which provide the operating results
and financial position of companies, and the detailed
information contained therein is useful for assessing
the operational efficiency and financial soundness
of a company. This requires proper analysis and
interpretation of such information for which a
number of techniques (tools) have been developed
by financial experts. In this chapter we will have an

without interpretation, and interpretation without analysis is difficult or even
impossible.

Financial statement analysis is a judgemental process which aims to estimate
current and past financial positions and the results of the operation of an
enterprise, with primary objective of determining the best possible estimates
and predictions about the future conditions. It essentially involves regrouping
and analysis of information provided by financial statements to establish
relationships and throw light on the points of strengths and weaknesses of a
business enterprise, which can be useful in decision-making involving comparison
with other firms (cross sectional analysis) and with firms’ own performance,
over a time period (time series analysis).

4.2 Significance of Analysis of Financial Statements

Financial analysis is the process of identifying the financial strengths and
weaknesses of the firm by properly establishing relationships between the various
items of the balance sheet and the statement of profit and loss. Financial analysis
can be undertaken by management of the firm, or by parties outside the firm,
viz., owners, trade creditors, lenders, investors, labour unions, analysts and
others. The nature of analysis will differ depending on the purpose of the analyst.
A technique frequently used by an analyst need not necessarily serve the purpose
of other analysts because of the difference in the interests of the analysts.
Financial analysis is useful and significant to different users in the following
ways:

(a) Finance manager: Financial analysis focusses on the facts and
relationships related to managerial performance, corporate efficiency,
financial strengths and weaknesses and creditworthiness of the company.
A finance manager must be well-equipped with the different tools of
analysis to make rational decisions for the firm. The tools for analysis
help in studying accounting data so as to determine the continuity of the
operating policies, investment value of the business, credit ratings and
testing the efficiency of operations. The techniques are equally important
in the area of financial control, enabling the finance manager to make
constant reviews of the actual financial operations of the firm to analyse
the causes of major deviations, which may help in corrective action
wherever indicated.

(b) Top management: The importance of financial analysis is not limited to
the finance manager alone. It has a broad scope which includes top
management in general and other functional managers. Management of
the firm would be interested in every aspect of the financial analysis. It is
their overall responsibility to see that the resources of the firm are

Reprint 2025-26



Analysis of Financial Statements 173

used most efficiently and that the firm’s financial condition is sound.
Financial analysis helps the management in measuring the success of
the company’s operations, appraising the individual’s performance and
evaluating the system of internal control.

(c) Trade payables: Trade payables, through an analysis of financial
statements, appraises not only the ability of the company to meet its
short-term obligations, but also judges the probability of its continued
ability to meet all its financial obligations in future. Trade payables are
particularly interested in the firm’s ability to meet their claims over a
very short period of time. Their analysis will, therefore, evaluate the firm’s
liquidity position.

(d) Lenders: Suppliers of long-term debt are concerned with the firm’s long-
term solvency and survival. They analyse the firm’s profitability over a
period of time, its ability to generate cash, to be able to pay interest and
repay the principal and the relationship between various sources of funds
(capital structure relationships). Long-term lenders  analyse the historical
financial statements to assess its future solvency and profitability.

(e) Investors: Investors, who have invested their money in the firm’s shares,
are interested about the firm’s earnings. As such, they concentrate on
the analysis of the firm’s present and future profitability. They are also
interested in the firm’s capital structure to ascertain its influences on
firm’s earning and risk. They also evaluate the efficiency of the
management and determine whether a change is needed or not. However,
in some large companies, the shareholders’ interest is limited to decide
whether to buy, sell or hold the shares.

(f) Labour unions: Labour unions analyse the financial statements to assess
whether it can presently afford a wage increase and whether it can absorb
a wage increase through increased productivity or by raising the prices.

(g) Others: The economists, researchers, etc., analyse the financial statements
to study the present business and economic conditions. The government
agencies need it for price regulations, taxation and other similar purposes.

4.3 Objectives of Analysis of Financial Statements

Analysis of financial statements reveals important facts concerning
managerial performance and the efficiency of the firm. Broadly speaking,
the objectives of the analysis are to apprehend the information contained
in financial statements with a view to know the weaknesses and strengths
of the firm and to make a forecast about the future prospects of the firm
thereby, enabling the analysts to take decisions regarding the operation of,

Reprint 2025-26



174 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

and further investment in the firm. To be more specific, the analysis is
undertaken to serve the following purposes (objectives):

• to assess the current profitability and operational efficiency of the
firm as a whole as well as its different departments so as to judge
the financial health of the firm.

• to ascertain the relative importance of different components of the
financial position of the firm.

• to identify the reasons for change in the profitability/financial position
of the firm.

• to judge the ability of the firm to repay its debt and assessing the
short-term as well as the long-term liquidity position of the firm.

Through the analysis of financial statements of various firms, an economist can
judge the extent of concentration of economic power and pitfalls in the financial
policies pursued. The analysis also provides the basis for many governmental
actions relating to licensing, controls, fixing of prices, ceiling on profits, dividend
freeze, tax subsidy and other concessions to the corporate sector.

4.4 Tools of Analysis of Financial Statements

The most commonly used techniques of financial analysis are as follows:
1. Comparative Statements: These are the statements showing the

profitability and financial position of a firm for different periods of time in
a comparative form to give an idea about the position of two or more periods.
It usually applies to the two important financial statements, namely,
balance sheet and statement of profit and loss prepared in a comparative
form. The financial data will be comparative only when same accounting
principles are used in preparing these statements. If this is not the case,
the deviation in the use of accounting principles should be mentioned as
a footnote. Comparative figures indicate the trend and direction of financial
position and operating results. This analysis is also known as ‘horizontal
analysis’.

2. Common Size Statements: These are the statements which indicate the
relationship of different items of a financial statement with a common item
by expressing each item as a percentage of that common item. The
percentage thus calculated can be easily compared with the results of
corresponding percentages of the previous year or of some other firms, as
the numbers are brought to common base. Such statements also allow an
analyst to compare the operating and financing characteristics of two
companies of different sizes in the same industry. Thus, common size
statements are useful, both, in intra-firm comparisons over different years
and also in making inter-firm comparisons for the same year or for several
years. This analysis is also known as ‘Vertical analysis’.

Analysis of Financial Statements 175

3. Trend Analysis: It is a technique of studying the operational results and
financial position over a series of years. Using the previous years’ data of a
business enterprise, trend analysis can be done to observe the percentage
changes over time in the selected data. The trend percentage is the
percentage relationship, in which each item of different years bear to the
same item in the base year. Trend analysis is important because, with its
long run view, it may point to basic changes in the nature of the business.
By looking at a trend in a particular ratio, one may find whether the ratio
is falling, rising or remaining relatively constant. From this observation, a
problem is detected or the sign of good or poor management is detected.

4. Ratio Analysis: It describes the significant relationship which exists
between various items of a balance sheet and a statement of profit and
loss of a firm. As a technique of financial analysis, accounting ratios measure
the comparative significance of the individual items of the income and
position statements. It is possible to assess the profitability, solvency and
efficiency of an enterprise through the technique of ratio analysis.

5. Cash Flow Analysis: It refers to the analysis of actual movement of cash
into and out of an organisation. The flow of cash into the business is called
as cash inflow or positive cash flow and the flow of cash out of the firm is
called as cash outflow or a negative cash flow. The difference between the
inflow and outflow of cash is the net cash flow. Cash flow statement is
prepared to project the manner in which the cash has been received and
has been utilised during an accounting year as it shows the sources of
cash receipts and also the purposes for which payments are made. Thus,
it summarises the causes for the changes in cash position of a business
enterprise between dates of two balance sheets.

In this chapter, we shall have a brief idea about the first three techniques,
viz., comparative statements, common size statements and trend analysis. The
ratio analysis and cash flow analysis is covered in detail in Chapters 5 and 6
respectively.

4.5 Comparative Statements
As stated earlier, these statements refer to the statement of profit and loss and
the balance sheet prepared by providing columns for the figures for both the
current year as well as for the previous year and for the changes during the
year, both in absolute and relative terms. As a result, it is possible to find out
not only the balances of accounts as on different dates and summaries of
different operational activities of different periods, but also the extent of their
increase or decrease between these dates. The figures in the comparative
statements can be used for identifying the direction of changes and also the
trends in different indicators of performance of an organisation.

The following steps may be followed to prepare the comparative statements:
Step 1 : List out absolute figures in rupees relating to two points of time (as
shown in columns 2 and 3 of Exhibit 4.1).
Step 2 : Find out change in absolute figures by subtracting the first year
(Col.2) from the second year (Col.3) and indicate the change as increase (+) or
decrease (–) and put it in column 4.
Step 3 : Preferably, also calculate the percentage change as follows and put it
in column 5.

4.6 Common Size Statement

Common Size Statement, also known as component percentage statement, is a
financial tool for studying the key changes and trends in the financial position
and operational result of a company. Here, each item in the statement is stated
as a percentage of the aggregate, or revenue from operations of which that
item is a part. For example, a common size balance sheet shows the percentage
of each asset to the total assets, and that of each liability to the total liabilities.
Similarly, in the common size  statement of profit and loss, the items of
expenditure are shown as a percentage of the revenue from operations. If
such a statement is prepared for successive periods, it shows the changes of
the respective percentages over a period of time.

Common size analysis is of immense use for comparing enterprises which
differ substantially in size as it provides an insight into the structure of financial
statements.  Inter-firm comparison or comparison of the company’s position
with the related industry as a whole is possible with the help of common size
statement analysis.

The following procedure may be adopted for preparing the common size
statements.

1. List out absolute figures in rupees at two points of time, say year 1,
and year 2 (Column 2 & 4 of Exhibit 4.2).

2. Choose a common base (as 100). For example, revenue from operations
may be taken as base (100) in case of statement of profit and loss  and
total assets or total liabilities (100) in case of balance sheet.

3. For all items of Col. 2 and 3 work out the percentage of that total.
Column 4 and 5 shows these percentages in Exhibit 4.2.

4.7 Limitations of Financial Analysis
Though financial analysis is quite helpful in determining financial strengths
and weaknesses of a firm, it is based on the information available in financial
statements. As such, the financial analysis also suffers from various limitations
of financial statements. Hence, the analyst must be conscious of the impact of
price level changes, window dressing of financial statements, changes in
accounting policies of a firm, accounting concepts and conventions, personal
judgement, etc. Some other limitations of financial analysis are:

1. Financial analysis does not consider price level changes.

2. Financial analysis may be misleading without the knowledge of the
changes in accounting procedure followed by a firm.

3. Financial analysis is just a study of reports of the company.

4. Monetary information alone is considered in financial analysis while
non-monetary aspects are ignored.

5. The financial statements are prepared on the basis of accounting
concept, as such, it does not reflect the current position.

Accounting Ratios 5

Financial statements aim at providing financial
information about a business enterprise to meet

the information needs of the decision-makers.
Financial statements prepared by a business
enterprise in the corporate sector are published and
are available to the decision-makers. These
statements provide financial data which require
analysis, comparison and interpretation for taking
decision by the external as well as internal users of
accounting information. This act is termed as
financial statement analysis. It is regarded as  an
integral and important part of accounting. As

the financial statements, it is termed as accounting ratio. For example, if the
gross profit of the business is Rs. 10,000 and the ‘Revenue from Operations’ are

10, 000
Rs. 1,00,000, it can be said that the gross profit is 10% × 100  of the

1, 00, 000
‘Revenue from Operations’. This ratio is termed as gross profit ratio. Similarly,
inventory turnover ratio may be 6 which implies that inventory turns into
‘Revenue from Operations’ six times in a year.

It needs to be observed that accounting ratios exhibit relationship, if any,
between accounting numbers extracted from financial statements. Ratios are
essentially derived numbers and their efficacy depends a great deal upon the
basic numbers from which they are calculated. Hence, if the financial statements
contain some errors, the derived numbers in terms of ratio analysis would also
present an erroneous scenario. Further, a ratio must be calculated using
numbers which are meaningfully correlated. A ratio calculated by using two
unrelated numbers would hardly serve any purpose. For example, the furniture
of the business is Rs. 1,00,000 and Purchases are Rs. 3,00,000. The ratio of
purchases to furniture is 3 (3,00,000/1,00,000) but it hardly has any relevance.
The reason is that there is no relationship between these two aspects.

5.2 Objectives of Ratio Analysis
Ratio analysis is indispensable part of interpretation of results revealed by the
financial statements. It provides users with crucial financial information and
points out the areas which require investigation. Ratio analysis is a technique
which involves regrouping of data by application of arithmetical relationships,
though its interpretation is a complex matter. It requires a fine understanding
of the way and the rules used for preparing financial statements. Once done
effectively, it provides a lot of information which helps the analyst:

1. To know the areas of the business which need more attention;
2. To know about the potential areas which can be improved with the

effort in the desired direction;
3. To provide a deeper analysis of the profitability, liquidity, solvency

and efficiency levels in the business;
4. To provide information for making cross-sectional analysis by

comparing the performance with the best industry standards; and
5. To provide information derived from financial statements useful for

making projections and estimates for the future.

5.3 Advantages of Ratio Analysis

The ratio analysis if properly done improves the user’s understanding of the
efficiency with which the business is being conducted. The numerical

Reprint 2025-26



196 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

relationships throw light on many latent aspects of the business. If properly
analysed, the ratios make us understand various problem areas as well as the
bright spots of the business. The knowledge of problem areas help management
take care of them in future. The knowledge of areas which are working better
helps you improve the situation further. It must be emphasised that ratios are
means to an end rather than the end in themselves. Their role is essentially
indicative and that of a whistle blower. There are many advantages derived
from ratio analysis. These are summarised as follows:

1. Helps to understand efficacy of decisions: The ratio analysis helps
you to understand whether the business firm has taken the right kind
of operating, investing and financing decisions. It indicates how far
they have helped in improving the performance.

2. Simplify complex figures and establish relationships: Ratios help in
simplifying the complex accounting figures and bring out their
relationships. They help summarise the financial information effectively
and assess the managerial efficiency, firm’s credit worthiness, earning
capacity, etc.

3. Helpful in comparative analysis: The ratios are not be calculated for
one year only. When many year figures are kept side by side, they help
a great deal in exploring the trends visible in the business. The
knowledge of trend helps in making projections about the business
which is a very useful feature.

4. Identification of problem areas: Ratios help business in identifying
the problem areas as well as the bright areas of the business. Problem
areas would need more attention and bright areas will need polishing
to have still better results.

5. Enables SWOT analysis: Ratios help a great deal in explaining the
changes occurring in the business. The information of change helps
the management a great deal in understanding the current threats
and opportunities and allows business to do its own SWOT (Strength-
Weakness-Opportunity-Threat) analysis.

6. Various comparisons: Ratios help comparisons with certain bench
marks to assess as to whether firm’s performance is better or otherwise.
For this purpose, the profitability, liquidity, solvency, etc., of a business,
may be compared: (i) over a number of accounting periods with itself
(Intra-firm Comparison/Time Series Analysis), (ii) with other business
enterprises (Inter-firm Comparison/Cross-sectional Analysis) and
(iii) with standards set for that firm/industry (comparison with standard
(or industry expectations).

5.4 Limitations of Ratio Analysis
Since the ratios are derived from the financial statements, any weakness in the
original financial statements will also creep in the derived analysis in the form of
ratio analysis. Thus, the limitations of financial statements also form the
limitations of the ratio analysis. Hence, to interpret the ratios, the user should
be aware of the rules followed in the preparation of financial statements and
also their nature and limitations. The limitations of ratio analysis which arise
primarily from the nature of financial statements are as under:

1. Limitations of Accounting Data: Accounting data give an unwarranted
impression of precision and finality. In fact, accounting data “reflect a
combination of recorded facts, accounting conventions and personal
judgements which affect them materially. For example, profit of the
business is not a precise and final figure. It is merely an opinion of the
accountant based on application of accounting policies. The soundness
of the judgement necessarily depends on the competence and integrity
of those who make them and on their adherence to Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles and Conventions”. Thus, the financial statements
may not reveal the true state of affairs of the enterprises and so the
ratios will also not give the true picture.

2. Ignores Price-level Changes: The financial accounting is based on
stable money measurement principle. It implicitly assumes that price
level changes are either non-existent or minimal. But the truth is
otherwise. We are normally living in inflationary economies where the
power of money declines constantly. A change in the price-level makes
analysis of financial statement of different accounting years meaningless
because accounting records ignore changes in value of money.

3. Ignore Qualitative or Non-monetary Aspects: Accounting provides
information about quantitative (or monetary) aspects of business.
Hence, the ratios also reflect only the monetary aspects, ignoring
completely the non-monetary (qualitative) factors.

4. Variations in Accounting Practices: There are differing accounting
policies for valuation of inventory, calculation of depreciation, treatment
of intangibles Assets definition of certain financial variables etc.,
available for various aspects of business transactions. These variations
leave a big question mark on the cross-sectional analysis. As there are
variations in accounting practices followed by different business
enterprises, a valid comparison of their financial statements is not
possible.

5. Forecasting: Forecasting of future trends based only on historical
analysis is not feasible. Proper forecasting requires consideration of
non-financial factors as well.

Now let us talk about the limitations of the ratios. The various limitations are:
1. Means and not the End: Ratios are means to an end rather than the

end by itself.
2. Lack of ability to resolve problems: Their role is essentially indicative

and of whistle blowing and not providing a solution to the problem.
3. Lack of standardised definitions: There is a lack of standardised

definitions of various concepts used in ratio analysis. For example,
there is no standard definition of liquid liabilities. Normally, it includes
all current liabilities, but sometimes it refers to current liabilities less
bank overdraft.

4. Lack of universally accepted standard levels: There is no universal
yardstick which specifies the level of ideal ratios. There is no standard
list of the levels universally acceptable, and, in India, the industry
averages are also not available.

5. Ratios based on unrelated figures: A ratio calculated for unrelated
figures would essentially be a meaningless exercise. For example,
creditors of Rs. 1,00,000 and furniture of Rs. 1,00,000 represent a
ratio of 1:1. But it has no relevance to assess efficiency or solvency.

Hence, ratios should be used with due consciousness of their limitations
while evaluating the performance of an organisation and planning the future
strategies for its improvement.

(a) The only purpose of financial reporting is to keep the managers informed

(b) Analysis of data provided in the financial statements is termed as financial

(e) Ratios help in comparisons of a firm’s results over a number of accounting

5.5 Types of Ratios
There is a two way classification of ratios: (1) traditional classification, and
(2) functional classification. The traditional classification has been on the
basis of financial statements to which the determinants of ratios belong. On
this basis the ratios are classified as follows:

Reprint 2025-26



Accounting Ratios 199

1. ‘Statement of Profit and Loss Ratios: A ratio of two variables from the
statement of profit and loss is known as statement of profit and loss
ratio. For example, ratio of gross profit to revenue from operations is
known as gross profit ratio. It is calculated using both figures from
the statement of profit and loss.

2. Balance Sheet Ratios: In case both variables are from the balance
sheet, it is classified as balance sheet ratios. For example, ratio of
current assets to current liabilities known as current ratio. It is
calculated using both figures from balance sheet.

3. Composite Ratios: If a ratio is computed with one variable from the
statement of profit and loss and another variable from the balance
sheet, it is called composite ratio. For example, ratio of credit revenue
from operations to trade receivables (known as trade receivables
turnover ratio) is calculated using one figure from the statement of
profit and loss (credit revenue from operations) and another figure
(trade receivables) from the balance sheet.

Although accounting ratios are calculated by taking data from financial
statements but classification of ratios on the basis of financial statements is
rarely used in practice. It must be recalled that basic purpose of accounting is
to throw light on the financial performance (profitability) and financial position
(its capacity to raise money and invest them wisely) as well as changes occurring
in financial position (possible explanation of changes in the activity level). As
such, the alternative classification (functional classification) based on the
purpose for which a ratio is computed, is the most commonly used classification
which is as follows:

1. Liquidity Ratios: To meet its commitments, business needs liquid
funds. The ability of the business to pay the amount due to
stakeholders as and when it is due is known as liquidity, and the
ratios calculated to measure it are known as ‘Liquidity Ratios’. These
are essentially short-term in nature.

2. Solvency Ratios: Solvency of business is determined by its ability to
meet its contractual obligations towards stakeholders, particularly
towards external stakeholders, and the ratios calculated to measure
solvency position are known as ‘Solvency Ratios’. These are essentially
long-term in nature.

3. Activity (or Turnover) Ratios:  This refers to the ratios that are
calculated for measuring the efficiency of operations of business based
on effective utilisation of resources. Hence, these are also known as
‘Efficiency Ratios’.

4. Profitability Ratios: It refers to the analysis of profits in relation to
revenue from operations or funds (or assets) employed in the business
and the ratios calculated to meet this objective are known as
‘Profitability Ratios’.

5.6 Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity ratios are calculated to measure the short-term solvency of the
business, i.e. the firm’s ability to meet its current obligations. These are
analysed by looking at the amounts of current assets and current liabilities in
the balance sheet. The two ratios included in this category are current ratio
and liquidity ratio.

5.6.1  Current Ratio
Current ratio is the proportion of current assets to current liabilities. It is
expressed as follows:

Current Assets
   Current Ratio  =  Current Assets : Current Liabilities or 

Current Liabilities
Current assets include current investments, inventories, trade receivables

(debtors and bills receivables), cash and cash equivalents, short-term loans and
advances and other current assets such as prepaid expenses, advance tax and
accrued income, etc.

Current liabilities include short-term borrowings, trade payables (creditors
and bills payables), other current liabilities and short-term provisions.

Illustration 1
Calulate Current Ratio from the following information:

Particulars (Rs.)
Inventories 50,000
Trade receivables 50,000
Advance tax 4,000
Cash and cash equivalents 30,000
Trade payables 1,00,000
Short-term borrowings (bank overdraft) 4,000

Solution:
Current Assets

Current Ratio =
Current Liabilities

Current Assets = Inventories + Trade receivables + Advance tax +
Cash and cash equivalents

= Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 4,000 + Rs. 30,000
= Rs. 1,34,000

Current Liabilities = Trade payables + Short-term borrowings
= Rs. 1,00,000 + Rs. 4,000
= Rs. 1,04,000

Current Ratio = =1.29 :1

Rs.1,04,000

Reprint 2025-26



Accounting Ratios 201

Significance: It provides a measure of degree to which current assets cover current
liabilities. The excess of current assets over current liabilities provides a measure
of safety margin available against uncertainty in realisation of current assets
and flow of funds. The ratio should be reasonable. It should neither be very high
or very low. Both the situations have their inherent disadvantages. A very high
current ratio implies heavy investment in current assets which is not a good
sign as it reflects under utilisation or improper utilisation of resources. A low
ratio endangers the business and puts it at risk of facing a situation where it
will not be able to pay its short-term debt on time. If this problem persists, it
may affect firm’s credit worthiness adversely. Normally, it is safe to have this
ratio within the range of 2:1.

5.6.2 Quick or Liquid Ratio

It is the ratio of quick (or liquid) asset to current liabilities. It is expressed as

Quick Assets
Quick ratio = Quick Assets : Current Liabilities  or  

Current Liabilities

The quick assets are defined as those assets which are quickly convertible
into cash. While calculating quick assets we exclude the inventories at the end
and other current assets such as prepaid expenses, advance tax, etc., from the
current assets. Because of exclusion of non-liquid current assets it is considered
better than current ratio as a measure of liquidity position of the business. It is
calculated to serve as a supplementary check on liquidity position of the business
and is therefore, also known as ‘Acid-Test Ratio’.

Quick Ratio = = 0.77 :1

Rs. 1,04,000

Significance: The ratio provides a measure of the capacity of the business to
meet its short-term obligations without any flaw. Normally, it is advocated to be

safe to have a ratio of 1:1 as unnecessarily low ratio will be very risky and a high
ratio suggests unnecessarily deployment of resources in otherwise less profitable
short-term investments.

current assets and current liabilities.

Solution:
Current Ratio = 3.5:1
Quick Ratio = 2:1
Let Current liabilities = x
Current assets = 3.5x
and Quick assets = 2x
Inventories = Current assets – Quick assets
24,000 = 3.5x – 2x
24,000 = 1.5x
x = Rs.16,000
Current Liabilities = Rs.16,000
Current Assets = 3.5x  =  3.5 × Rs. 16,000  =  Rs. 56,000.

The current ratio is 2 : 1. State giving reasons which of the following transactions
would improve, reduce and not change the current ratio:

(a) Payment of current liability;
(b) Purchased goods on credit;
(c) Sale of a Computer (Book value: Rs. 4,000) for Rs. 3,000 only;
(d) Sale of merchandise (goods) costing Rs. 10,000 for Rs. 11,000;
(e) Payment of unclaimed dividend.

Solution:
The given current ratio is 2 : 1. Let us assume that current assets are Rs.
50,000 and current liabilities are Rs. 25,000; Thus, the current ratio is 2 : 1.
Now we will analyse the effect of given transactions on current ratio.

(a) Assume that Rs. 10,000 of creditors is paid by cheque. This will reduce
the current assets to Rs. 40,000 and current liabilities to Rs. 15,000.
The new ratio will be 2.67 : 1 (Rs. 40,000/Rs.15,000). Hence, it has
improved.

(b) Assume that goods of Rs. 10,000 are purchased on credit. This will
increase the current assets to Rs. 60,000 and current liabilities to
Rs. 35,000. The new ratio will be 1.7:1 (Rs. 60,000/Rs. 35,000). Hence,
it has reduced.

(c) Due to sale of a computer (a fixed asset) the current assets will
increase to Rs. 53,000 without any change in the current liabilities.
The new ratio will be 2.12 : 1 (Rs. 53,000/Rs. 25,000). Hence, it has
improved.

(d) This transaction will decrease the inventories by Rs. 10,000 and
increase the cash by Rs. 11,000 thereby increasing the current
assets by Rs. 1,000 without any change in the current liabilities.
The new ratio will be 2.04 : 1 (Rs. 51,000/Rs. 25,000). Hence, it has
improved.

(e) Assume that `5,000 is given by way of unclaimed dividend. It will
reduce the current assets to ̀ 45,000 and unclaimed current liabilities
by `5,000. The new ratio will be 2:25:1 (`45,000/`20,000). Hence,
it has improved.

Accounting Ratios 205

repayment of principal amount at the end of the loan period. Solvency ratios
are calculated to determine the ability of the business to service its debt in
the long run. The following ratios are normally computed for evaluating
solvency of the business.

1. Debt-Equity Ratio;
2. Debt to Capital Employed Ratio;
3. Proprietary Ratio;
4. Total Assets to Debt Ratio;
5. Interest Coverage Ratio.

5.7.1 Debt-Equity Ratio
Debt-Equity Ratio measures the relationship between long-term debt and
equity. If debt component of the total long-term funds employed is small,
outsiders feel more secure. From security point of view, capital structure
with less debt and more equity is considered favourable as it reduces the
chances of bankruptcy.  Normally, it is considered to be safe if debt equity
ratio is 2 : 1. However, it may vary from industry to industry. It is computed
as follows:

Long − term Debts
Debt-Equity Ratio =

Shareholders’ Funds 

where:
Shareholders’ Funds (Equity) = Share capital + Reserves and Surplus +

Money received against share warrants +
Share application money pending allotment

Share Capital = Equity share capital + Preference share capital
or

Shareholders’ Funds (Equity) = Non-current sssets + Working capital –
Non-current liabilities

Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities

Significance: This ratio measures the degree of indebtedness of an enterprise
and gives an idea to the long-term lender regarding extent of security of the
debt. As indicated earlier, a low debt equity ratio reflects more security. A high
ratio, on the other hand, is considered risky as it may put the firm into
difficulty in meeting its obligations to outsiders. However, from the perspective
of the owners, greater use of debt (trading on equity) may help in ensuring
higher returns for them if the rate of earnings on capital employed is higher
than the rate of interest payable.

5.7.2 Debt to Capital Employed Ratio

The Debt to capital employed ratio refers to the ratio of long-term debt to the
total of external and internal funds (capital employed or net assets). It is
computed as follows:
Debt to Capital Employed Ratio = Long-term Debt/Capital Employed (or Net Assets)

Capital employed is equal to the long-term debt + shareholders’ funds.
Alternatively, it may be taken as net assets which are equal to the total assets
– current liabilities taking the data of Illustration 7, capital employed shall
work out to Rs. 5,00,000 + Rs. 15,00,000 = Rs. 20,00,000. Similarly, Net
Assets as Rs. 25,00,000 – Rs. 5,00,000 = Rs. 20,00,000 and the Debt to
capital employed ratio as Rs. 5,00,000/Rs. 20,00,000 = 0.25:1.
Significance: Like debt-equity ratio, it shows proportion of long-term debts in
capital employed. Low ratio provides security to lenders and high ratio helps
management in trading on equity. In the above case, the debt to Capital Employed
ratio is less than half which indicates reasonable funding by debt and adequate
security of debt.

It may be noted that Debt  to Capital Employed Ratio can also be computed
in relation to total assets. In that case, it usually refers to the ratio of total

Reprint 2025-26



Accounting Ratios 209

debts (long-term debts + current liabilities) to total assets, i.e., total of non-
current and current assets (or shareholders’, funds + long-term debts + current
liabilities), and is expressed as

Total Debts
Debt to Capital Employed Ratio =

Total Assets

5.7.3    Proprietary Ratio
Proprietary ratio expresses relationship of proprietor’s (shareholders) funds to
net assets and is calculated as follows :

Proprietary Ratio =  Shareholders’, Funds/Capital employed (or net assets)
Based on data of Illustration 7, it shall be worked out as follows:

Rs. 15,00,000/Rs. 20,00,000 = 0.75 : 1

Significance: Higher proportion of shareholders funds in financing the assets
is a positive feature as it provides security to creditors. This ratio can also be
computed in relation to total assets instead of net assets (capital employed). It
may be noted that the total of debt to capital employed ratio and proprietory
ratio is equal to 1. Take these ratios worked out on the basis of data of Illustration
7, the debt  to Capital Employed  ratio is 0.25 : 1 and the Proprietory Ratio
0.75 : 1 the total is 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. In terms of percentage it can be stated that
the 25% of the capital employed is funded by debts and 75% by owners’ funds.

5.7.4 Total Assets to Debt Ratio
This ratio measures the extent of the coverage of long-term debts by assets. It
is calculated as

Total assets to Debt Ratio  =  Total assets/Long-term debts
Taking the data of Illustration 8, this ratio will be worked out as follows:
Rs. 14,00,000/Rs. 1,50,000 = 9.33 : 1
The higher ratio indicates that assets have been mainly financed by

owners funds and the long-term loans is adequately covered by assets.
It is better to take the net assets (capital employed) instead of total

assets for computing this ratio also. It is observed that in that case, the
ratio is  the reciprocal of the debt to capital employed ratio.
Significance: This ratio primarily indicates the rate of external funds in
financing the assets and the extent of coverage of their debts are covered
by assets.

The debt equity ratio of X Ltd. is 0.5 : 1. Which of the following would
increase/decrease or not change the debt equity ratio?

(i) Further issue of equity shares
(ii) Cash received from debtors
(iii) Sale of goods on cash basis
(iv) Redemption of debentures
(v) Purchase of goods on credit.

Solution:

The change in the ratio depends upon the original ratio. Let us assume that
external funds are Rs. 5,00,000 and internal funds are Rs. 10,00,000.
Now we will analyse the effect of given transactions on debt equity ratio.

(i) Assume that Rs. 1,00,000 worth of equity shares are issued. This
will increase the internal funds to Rs. 11,00,000. The new ratio will
be 0.45 : 1 (5,00,000/11,00,000). Thus, it is clear that further
issue of equity shares decreases the debt-equity ratio.

(ii) Cash received from debtors will leave the internal and external funds
unchanged as this will only affect the composition of current assets.
Hence, the debt-equity ratio will remain unchanged.

(iii) This will also leave the ratio unchanged as sale of goods on cash basis
neither affect Debt nor equity.

(iv) Assume that Rs. 1,00,000 debentures are redeemed. This will decrease
the long-term debt to Rs. 4,00,000. The new ratio will be 0.4 : 1
(4,00,000/10,00,000). Redemption of debentures will decrease the
debit-equity ratio.

(v) This will also leave the ratio unchanged as purchase of goods on credit
neither affect Debt nor equity.

5.7.5 Interest Coverage Ratio

It is a ratio which deals with the servicing of interest on loan. It is a measure of
security of interest payable on long-term debts. It expresses the relationship
between profits available for payment of interest and the amount of interest
payable. It is calculated as follows:

Interest Coverage Ratio = Net Profit before Interest and Tax
   Interest on long-term debts

Significance: It reveals the number of times interest on long-term debts is covered
by the profits available for interest. A higher ratio ensures safety of interest on
debts.

Illustration 11
From the following details, calculate interest coverage ratio:
Net Profit after tax  Rs. 60,000; 15% Long-term debt 10,00,000; and Tax rate
40%.

Solution:
Net Profit after Tax = Rs. 60,000
Tax Rate = 40%
Net Profit before tax = Net profit after tax × 100/(100 – Tax rate)

= Rs. 60,000 × 100/(100 – 40)
= Rs. 1,00,000

Interest on Long-term Debt = 15% of Rs. 10,00,000  =  Rs. 1,50,000
Net profit before interest and tax = Net profit before tax + Interest

= Rs. 1,00,000 + Rs. 1,50,000 = Rs. 2,50,000
Interest Coverage Ratio = Net Profit before Interest and

Tax/Interest on long-term debt
= Rs. 2,50,000/Rs. 1,50,000
= 1.67 times.

5.8 Activity (or Turnover) Ratio

These ratios indicate the speed at which, activities of the business are being
performed. The activity ratios express the number of times assets employed,
or, for that matter, any constituent of assets, is turned into sales during an
accounting period. Higher turnover ratio means better utilisation of assets
and signifies improved efficiency and profitability, and as such are known as
efficiency ratios. The important activity ratios calculated under this category
are

1. Inventory Turnover;
2. Trade receivable Turnover;
3. Trade payable Turnover;
4. Investment (Net assets) Turnover
5. Fixed assets Turnover; and
6. Working capital Turnover.

5.8.1 Inventory Turnover Ratio
It determines the number of times inventory is converted into revenue from
operations during the accounting period under consideration. It expresses
the relationship between the cost of revenue from operations and average
inventory. The formula for its calculation is as follows:

Inventory Turnover Ratio  =  Cost of Revenue from Operations / Average Inventory

Where average inventory refers to arithmetic average of opening and
closing inventory, and the cost of revenue from operations means revenue
from operations less gross profit.

Significance : It studies the frequency of conversion of inventory of finished
goods into revenue from operations. It is also a measure of liquidity. It
determines how many times inventory is purchased or replaced during a
year. Low turnover of inventory may be due to bad buying, obsolete
inventory, etc., and is a danger signal. High turnover is good but it must
be carefully interpreted as it may be due to buying in small lots or selling
quickly at low margin to realise cash. Thus, it throws light on utilisation of
inventory of goods.

5.8.2 Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio
It expresses the relationship between credit revenue from operations and trade
receivable. It is calculated as follows :

Trade Receivable Turnover ratio = Net Credit Revenue from Operations/Average
Trade Receivable

Where Average Trade Receivable = (Opening Debtors and Bills Receivable + Closing
Debtors and Bills Receivable)/2

It needs to be noted that debtors should be taken before making any provision
for doubtful debts.

Significance: The liquidity position of the firm depends upon the speed with
which trade receivables are realised. This ratio indicates the number of times
the receivables are turned over and converted into cash in an accounting period.
Higher turnover means speedy collection from trade receivable. This ratio also
helps in working out the average collection period. The ratio is calculated by
dividing the days or months in a year by trade receivables turnover ratio.

5.9 Profitability Ratios

The profitability or financial performance is mainly summarised in the statement
of profit and loss. Profitability ratios are calculated to analyse the earning capacity
of the business which is the outcome of utilisation of resources employed in the
business. There is a close relationship between the profit and the efficiency with
which the resources employed in the business are utilised. The various ratios
which are commonly used to analyse the profitability of the business are:

1. Gross profit ratio
2. Operating ratio
3. Operating profit ratio
4. Net profit ratio
5. Return on Investment (ROI) or Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
6. Return on Net Worth (RONW)
7. Earnings per share
8. Book value per share
9. Dividend payout ratio

10. Price earning ratio.

5.9.1 Gross Profit Ratio
Gross profit ratio as a percentage of revenue from operations is computed to
have an idea about gross margin. It is computed as follows:

Gross Profit Ratio = Gross Profit/Net Revenue of Operations × 100
Significance: It indicates gross margin  on products sold. It also indicates the
margin available to cover operating expenses, non-operating expenses, etc.
Change in gross profit ratio may be due to change in selling price or cost of
revenue from operations or a combination of both. A low ratio may indicate
unfavourable purchase and sales policy. Higher gross profit ratio is always a
good sign.

= Rs.90,000

Gross Profit = Revenue from Operations – Cost of Revenue from
Operation

= Rs.1,00,000 – Rs.90,000
= Rs. 10,000

Gross Profit Ratio = Gross Profit/Net Revenue from Operations ×100
= Rs.10,000/Rs.1,00,000 × 100
= 10%.

5.9.2 Operating Ratio
It is computed to analyse cost of operation in relation to revenue from
operations. It is calculated as follows:

Operating Ratio = (Cost of Revenue from Operations + Operating Expenses)/
Net Revenue from Operations ×100

Operating expenses include office expenses, administrative expenses, selling
expenses, distribution expenses, depreciation and employee benefit expenses
etc.

Cost of operation is determined by excluding non-operating incomes and
expenses such as loss on sale of assets, interest paid, dividend received, loss
by fire, speculation gain and so on.

5.9.3 Operating Profit Ratio
It is calculated to reveal operating margin. It may be computed directly or as a
residual of operating ratio.

Operating Profit Ratio = 100 – Operating Ratio

Reprint 2025-26



Accounting Ratios 225

Alternatively, it is calculated as under:
Operating Profit Ratio =  Operating Profit/ Revenue from Operations × 100
Where Operating Profit =  Revenue from Operations – Operating Cost

Significance: Operating ratio is computed to express cost of operations excluding
financial charges in relation to revenue from operations. A corollary of it is
‘Operating Profit Ratio’. It helps to analyse the performance of business and
throws light on the operational efficiency of the business. It is very useful for
inter-firm as well as intra-firm comparisons. Lower operating ratio is a very
healthy sign.

5.9.4 Net Profit Ratio
Net profit ratio is based on all inclusive concept of profit. It relates revenue from
operations to net profit after operational as well as non-operational expenses
and incomes. It is calculated as under:

Net Profit Ratio     =    Net profit/Revenue from Operations × 100

Generally, net profit refers to profit after tax (PAT).
Significance: It is a measure of net profit margin in relation to revenue from
operations. Besides revealing profitability, it is the main variable in computation
of Return on Investment. It reflects the overall efficiency of the business, assumes
great significance from the point of view of investors.

Illustration 21
Gross profit ratio of a company was 25%. Its credit revenue from operations
was Rs. 20,00,000 and its cash revenue from operations was 10% of the total
revenue from operations. If the indirect expenses of the company were Rs.
50,000, calculate its net profit ratio.

Solution:
Cash Revenue from Operations = Rs.20,00,000 × 10/90

= Rs.2,22,222
Hence, total Revenue from Operations are = Rs.22,22,222
Gross profit = 0.25 × 22,22,222 = Rs. 5,55,555
Net profit = Rs.5,55,555 – 50,000

= Rs.5,05,555
Net profit ratio = Net profit/Revenue from Operations

× 100
= Rs.5,05,555/Rs.22,22,222 × 100
= 22.75%.

5.9.5 Return on Capital Employed or Investment
It explains the overall utilisation of funds by a business enterprise. Capital
employed means the long-term funds employed in the business and includes
shareholders’ funds, debentures and long-term loans. Alternatively, capital
employed may be taken as the total of non-current assets and working capital.
Profit refers to the Profit Before Interest and Tax (PBIT) for computation of
this ratio. Thus, it is computed as follows:

Return on Investment (or Capital Employed) = Profit before Interest and Tax/
Capital Employed × 100

Significance: It measures return on capital employed in the business. It reveals
the efficiency of the business in utilisation of funds entrusted to it by shareholders,
debenture-holders and long-term loans. For inter-firm comparison, return on
capital employed funds is considered a good measure of profitability. It also

helps in assessing whether the firm is earning a higher return on capital employed
as compared to the interest rate paid.

5.9.6 Return on Shareholders’ Funds
This ratio is very important from shareholders’ point of view in assessing whether
their investment in the firm generates a reasonable return or not. It should be
higher than the return on investment otherwise it would imply that company’s
funds have not been employed profitably.

A better measure of profitability from shareholders point of view is obtained
by determining return on total shareholders’ funds, it is also termed as Return
on Net Worth (RONW) and is calculated as under :

Profit after Tax
Return on Shareholders’ Fund = ×  100

Shareholders’ Funds

5.9.7 Earnings per Share
The ratio is computed as:

EPS =  Profit available for equity shareholders/Number of Equity Shares
In this context, earnings refer to profit available for equity shareholders which

is worked out as
Profit after Tax – Dividend on Preference Shares.

This ratio is very important from equity shareholders point of view and
also for the share price in the stock market. This also helps comparison with
other to ascertain its reasonableness and capacity to pay dividend.

5.9.8 Book Value per Share
This ratio is calculated as :

Book Value per share = Equity shareholders’ funds/Number of Equity Shares
Equity shareholder fund refers to Shareholders’ Funds – Preference Share

Capital. This ratio is again very important from equity shareholders point of
view as it gives an idea about the value of their holding and affects market price
of the shares.

5.9.9 Dividend Payout Ratio

This refers to the proportion of earning that are distributed to the shareholders.
It is calculated as –

Dividend per share
Dividend Payout Ratio = 

Earnings per share

This reflects company’s dividend policy and growth in owner’s equity.

5.9.10 Price / Earning Ratio
The ratio is computed as –

P/E Ratio =  Market Price of a share/earnings per share
For example, if the EPS of  X Ltd. is Rs. 10 and market price is Rs. 100, the price

earning ratio will be 10 (100/10). It reflects investors expectation about the growth
in the firm’s earnings and reasonableness of the market price of its shares. P/E
Ratio vary from industy to industry and company to company in the same industry
depending upon investors perception of their future.

From the following details, calculate Return on Investment:

Share Capital : Equity (Rs.10) Rs. 4,00,000 Current Liabilities Rs. 1,00,000
                       12% Preference Rs. 1,00,000 Fixed Assets Rs. 9,50,000
General Reserve Rs. 1,84,000 Current Assets Rs. 2,34,000
10% Debentures Rs. 4,00,000

Also calculate Return on Shareholders’ Funds, EPS, Book value per share
and P/E ratio if the market price of the share is Rs. 34 and the net profit after tax
was Rs. 1,50,000, and the tax had amounted to Rs. 50,000.

Solution:
Profit before interest and tax = Rs. 1,50,000 + Debenture interest + Tax

= Rs. 1,50,000 + Rs. 40,000 + Rs. 50,000
= Rs.2,40,000

Capital Employed = Equity Share Capital + Preference Share
Capital + Reserves + Debentures

= Rs. 4,00,000 + Rs. 1,00,000 + Rs. 1,84,000
+ Rs. 4,00,000 = Rs. 10,84,000

Return on Investment = Profit before Interest and Tax/
Capital Employed × 100

= Rs. 2,40,000/Rs. 10,84,000 × 100
= 22.14%

Shareholders’ Fund = Equity Share Capital + Preference Share Capital
+ General Reserve

= Rs. 4,00,000 + Rs. 1,00,000 + Rs. 1,84,000
= Rs. 6,84,000

Return on Shareholders’ Funds = Profit after tax/shareholders’ Funds × 100
= Rs. 1,50,000/Rs. 6,84,000 × 100
= 21.93%

EPS = Profit available for Equity Shareholders/

Preference Share Dividend = Rate of Dividend × Prefence Share Capital
= 12% of Rs. 1,00,000
= Rs. 12,000

Profit available to equity = Profit after Tax – Preference dividend on
      Shareholders preference shares

where, Dividend on Prefrence = Rate of Dividend × Preference Share Capital
shares = 12% of Rs. 1,00,000

= Rs.12,000
= Rs. 1,50,000 – Rs. 12,000 = Rs. 1,38,000

Revenue from Operations Rs. 3,00,000 and gross profit ratio is 20% of revenue from
operations.
Current liabilities = Rs. 40,000
Quick ratio = 0.75 : 1

Solution:
Cost of Revenue from Operations = Revenue from Operations – Gross Profit

= Rs. 3,00,000 – (Rs. 3,00,000 × 20%)
= Rs. 3,00,000 – Rs. 60,000
= Rs. 2,40,000

Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Revenue from Operations/ Average Inventory

Reprint 2025-26



230 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

Average Inventory = Cost of  Revenue from Operations/4
= Rs. 2,40,000/4   =   Rs. 60,000

Average Inventory = (Opening inventory + Closing inventory)/2
Rs. 60,000 = Opening inventory + (Opening inventory

+Rs.20,000)/2
Rs. 60,000 = Opening inventory + Rs. 10,000
Opening Inventory = Rs. 50,000
Closing Inventory = Rs. 70,000
Liquid Ratio = Liquid assets/current liabilities
0.75 = Liquid assets/Rs. 40,000
Liquid Assets = Rs. 40,000 × 0.75   =  Rs. 30,000
Current Assets = Liquid assets + Closing inventory

= Rs. 30,000 + Rs. 70,000 = Rs. 1,00,000

Solution:
Current liabilities = Rs. 20,000
For a ratio of 2 : 1, the current assets must be 2 × 20,000 = Rs. 40,000
Present level of current assets = Rs. 50,000

Summary

Ratio Analysis: An important tool of financial statement analysis is ratio
analysis. Accounting ratios represent relationship between two accounting
numbers.
Objective of Ratio Analysis: The objective of ratio analysis is to provide a
deeper analysis of the profitability, liquidity, solvency and activity levels in
the business. It is also to identify the problem areas as well as the strong
areas of the business.
Advantages of Ratio Analysis: Ratio analysis offers many advantages
including enabling financial statement analysis, helping understand efficacy
of decisions, simplifying complex figures and establish relationships, being
helpful in comparative analysis, identification of problem areas, enables
SWOT analysis, and allows various comparisons.
Limitations of Ratio Analysis: There are many limitations of ratio analysis.
Few are based because of the basic limitations of the accounting data on
which it is based. In the first set are included factors like Historical Analysis,
Ignores Price-level Changes, Ignore Qualitative or Non-monetary Aspects,
Limitations of Accounting Data, Variations in Accounting Practices, and
Forecasting. In the second set are included factor like means and not the
end, lack of ability to resolve problems, lack of standardised definitions,
lack of universally accepted standard levels, and ratios based on unrelated
figures.
Types of Ratios: There are many types of ratios, viz., liquidity, solvency,
activity and profitability ratios. The liquidity ratios include current ratio
and acid test ratio.  Solvency ratios are calculated to determine the ability
of the business to service its debt in the long run instead of in the short
run. They include debt equity ratio, total assets to debt ratio, proprietary

ratio and interest coverage ratio. The turnover ratios basically exhibit the
activity levels characterised by the capacity of the business to make more
sales or turnover and include Inventory Turnover, Trade Receivables
Turnover, Trade Payables Turnover, Working Capital Turnover, Fixed Assets
Turnover and Current assets Turnover. Profitability ratios are calculated
to analyse the earning capacity of the business which is the outcome of
utilisation of resources employed in the business. The ratios include Gross
Profit ratio, Operating ratio, Net Profit Ratio, Return on investment (Capital
employed), Earnings per Share, Book Value per Share, Dividend per Share
and Price/Earning ratio.

Cash Flow Statement 6

Tiill now you have learnt about the financial
statements being primarily inclusive of Position

Statement (showing the financial position of an
enterprise as on a particular date) and Income
Statement (showing the result of the operational
activities of an enterprise over a particular period).
There is also a third important financial statement
known as Cash flow statement, which shows inflows
and outflows of the cash and cash equivalents. This
statement is usually  prepared by companies which
comes as a tool in the hands of users of financial
information to know about the sources and uses of
cash and cash equivalents of an enterprise over a
period of time from various activities of an

equivalents of an enterprise by classifying cash flows into operating, investing
and financing activities. It requires that an enterprise should prepare a cash
flow statement and should present it for each accounting period for which
financial statements are presented. This chapter discusses this technique and
explains the method of preparing a cash flow statement for an accounting
period.

6.1 Objectives of Cash Flow Statement
A Cash flow statement shows inflow and outflow of cash and cash equivalents
from various activities of a company during a specific period. The primary objective
of cash flow statement is to provide useful information about cash flows (inflows
and outflows) of an enterprise during a particular period under various heads,
i.e., operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.

This information is useful in providing users of financial statements with a
basis to assess the ability of the enterprise to generate cash and cash equivalents
and the needs of the enterprise to utilise those cash flows. The economic decisions
that are taken by users require an evaluation of the ability of an enterprise to
generate cash and cash equivalents and the timing and certainty of their
generation.

6.2 Benefits of Cash Flow Statement
Cash flow statement provides the following benefits :

 A cash flow statement when used along with other financial statements
provides information that enables users to evaluate changes in net assets
of an enterprise, its financial structure (including its liquidity and
solvency) and its ability to affect the amounts and timings of cash flows
in order to adapt to changing circumstances and opportunities.

 Cash flow information is useful in assessing the ability of the enterprise
to generate cash and cash equivalents and enables users to develop
models to assess and compare the present value of the future cash
flows of different enterprises.

 It also enhances the comparability of the reporting of operating
performance by different enterprises because it eliminates the effects of
using different accounting treatments for the same transactions and
events.

 It also helps in balancing its cash inflow and cash outflow, keeping in
response to changing condition. It is also helpful in checking the
accuracy of past assessments of future cash flows and in examining
the relationship between profitability and net cash flow and impact of
changing prices.

Cash Flow Statement 243

6.3 Cash and Cash Equivalents

As stated earlier, cash flow statement shows inflows and outflows of cash and
cash equivalents from various activities of an enterprise during a particular
period. As per AS-3, ‘Cash’ comprises cash in hand and demand deposits with
banks, and  ‘Cash equivalents’ means short-term highly liquid investments that
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to
an insignificant risk of changes in value. An investment normally qualifies as
cash equivalents only when it has a short maturity, of say, three months or less
from the date of acquisition. Investments in shares are excluded from cash
equivalents unless they are in substantial cash equivalents. For example,
preference shares of a company acquired shortly before their specific redemption
date, provided there is only insignificant risk of failure of the company to repay
the amount at maturity. Similarly, short-term marketable securities which can
be readily converted into cash are treated as cash equivalents and is liquidable
immediately without considerable change in value.

6.4 Cash Flows
‘Cash Flows’  implies movement of cash in and out due to some non-cash items.
Receipt of cash from a non-cash item is termed as cash inflow while cash payment
in respect of such items as cash outflow. For example, purchase of machinery
by paying cash  is cash outflow while sale proceeds received from sale of
machinery is cash inflow. Other examples of cash flows include collection of
cash from trade receivables, payment to trade payables, payment to employees,
receipt of dividend, interest  payments, etc.

Cash  management includes the investment of excess cash in cash equivalents.
Hence, purchase of marketable securities or short-term investment which
constitutes cash equivalents is not considered while preparing cash flow
statement.

6.5 Classification of Activities for the Preparation of Cash Flow
Statement

You know that various activities of an enterprise result into cash flows (inflows
or receipts and outflows or payments) which is the subject matter of a cash flow
statement. As per AS-3, these activities are to be classified into three categories:
(1) operating, (2) investing, and (3) financing activities so as to show separately
the cash flows generated (or used) by (in) these activities. This helps the users of
cash flow statement to assess the impact of these activities on the financial
position of an enterprise and also on its cash and cash equivalents.

Reprint 2025-26



244 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

6.5.1  Cash from Operating Activities
Operating activities are the activities that constitute the primary or main activities
of an enterprise. For example, for a company manufacturing garments, operating
activities are procurement of raw material, incurrence of manufacturing expenses,
sale of garments, etc. These are the principal  revenue generating activities (or
the main activities) of the enterprise and these activities are not investing or
financing activities. The amount of cash from operations’ indicates the internal
solvency level of the company, and is regarded as the key indicator of the extent
to which the operations of the enterprise have generated sufficient cash flows to
maintain the operating capability of the enterprise, paying dividends, making of
new investments and repaying of loans without recourse to external source of
financing.

Cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from the main
activities of the enterprise. They generally result from the transactions and other
events that enter into the determination of net profit or loss. Examples of cash
flows from operating activities are:

Cash Inflows from operating activities

 cash receipts from sale of  goods and the rendering of services.
 cash receipts from royalties, fees, commissions and other revenues.

Cash Outflows from operating activities

 Cash payments to suppliers for goods and services.
 Cash payments to and on behalf of the employees.
 Cash payments to an insurance enterprise for premiums and claims,

annuities, and other policy benefits.
 Cash payments of income taxes unless they can be specifically identified

with financing and investing activities.
The net position is shown in case of operating cash flows.

An enterprise may hold securities and loans for dealing or for trading
purposes. In either case they represent Inventory specifically held for resale.
Therefore, cash flows arising from the purchase and sale of dealing or trading
securities are classified as operating activities. Similarly, cash advances and
loans made by financial enterprises are usually classified as operating activities
since they relate to main activity of that enterprise.

6.5.2 Cash from Investing Activities
As per AS-3, investing activities are the acquisition and  disposal of long-term
assets and other investments not included in cash  equivalents. Investing
activities relate to purchase and sale of long-term assets or fixed assets such

Reprint 2025-26



Cash Flow Statement 245

as machinery, furniture, land and building, etc. Transactions related to long-
term investment are also investing activities.

Separate disclosure of cash flows from investing activities is important
because they represent the extent to which expenditures have been made for
resources intended to generate future income and cash flows.  Examples of cash
flows arising from investing activities are:

Cash Outflows from investing activities

 Cash payments to acquire fixed assets including intangibles and
capitalised research and development.

 Cash payments to acquire shares, warrants or debt instruments of other
enterprises other than the instruments those held for trading purposes.

 Cash advances and loans made to third party (other than advances
and loans made by a financial enterprise wherein it is operating
activities).

Cash Inflows from Investing Activities

 Cash receipt from disposal of  fixed assets including intangibles.
 Cash receipt from the repayment of advances or loans made to third

parties (except in case of financial enterprise).
 Cash receipt from disposal of shares, warrants or debt instruments of

other enterprises except those held for trading purposes.
 Interest received in cash from loans and advances.
 Dividend received from investments in other enterprises.

6.5.3 Cash from Financing Activities
As the name suggests, financing activities relate to long-term funds or capital of
an enterprise, e.g., cash proceeds from issue of equity shares, debentures, raising
long-term bank loans, repayment of bank loan, etc. As per AS-3, financing
activities are activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the
owners’ capital   (including preference share capital in case of a company) and
borrowings of the enterprise. Separate disclosure of cash flows arising from
financing activities is important because it is useful in predicting claims on future
cash flows by providers of funds ( both capital and borrowings ) to the enterprise.
Examples of financing activities are:

Cash Inflows from financing activities

 Cash proceeds from issuing shares (equity or/and preference).
 Cash proceeds from issuing debentures, loans, bonds and other

short/ long-term borrowings.

Reprint 2025-26



246 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

Cash Outflows from financing activities

 Cash repayments of amounts borrowed.
 Interest paid on debentures and long-term loans and advances.
 Dividends paid on equity and preference capital.

It is important to mention here that a transaction may include cash flows
that are classified differently. For example, when the instalment paid in respect
of a fixed asset acquired on deferred payment basis includes both interest and
loan, the interest element is classified under financing activities and the loan
element is classified under investing activities. Moreover, same activity may be
classified differently for different enterprises. For example, purchase of shares is
an operating activity for a share brokerage firm while it is investing activity in
case of other enterprises.

6.5.4 Treatment of Some Peculiar Items
Extraordinary items

Extraordinary items are not the regular phenomenon, e.g., loss due to theft
or earthquake or flood. Extraordinary items are non-recurring in nature and
hence cash flows associated with extraordinary items should be classified and
disclosed separately as arising from operating, investing or financing activities.
This is done to enable users to understand their nature and effect on the
present and future cash flows of an enterprise.

Interest and Dividend

In case of a financial enterprise (whose main business is lending and borrowing),
interest paid,  interest received  and dividend received are classified as operating
activities while  dividend  paid is a financing activity.

In case of a non-financial enterprise, as per AS-3, it is considered more
appropriate that  payment of interest and dividends are classified as financing
activities whereas receipt of interest and dividends are classified as investing
activities.

Taxes on Income and Gains

Taxes may be income tax (tax on normal profit), capital gains tax (tax on
capital profits), dividend tax (tax on the amount distributed as dividend to
shareholders). AS-3 requires that cash flows arising from taxes on income
should be separately disclosed and should be classified as cash flows from
operating activities unless they can be specifically identified with financing
and investing activities. This clearly implies that:

 tax on operating profit should be classified as operating cash flows.
 dividend tax, i.e., tax paid on dividend should be classified as financing

activity along with dividend paid.
 Capital gains tax paid on sale of fixed assets should be classified under

investing activities.

Non-cash Transactions

As per AS-3, investing and financing transactions that do not require the use
of cash or cash equivalents should be excluded from a cash flow statement.
Examples of such transactions are – acquisition of machinery by issue of equity
shares or redemption of debentures by issue of equity shares. Such transactions
should be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements in a way that provide
all the relevant information about these investing and financing activities.
Hence, assets acquired by issue of shares are not disclosed in cash flow
statement due to non-cash nature of the transaction.

6.6 Ascertaining Cash Flow from Operating Activities

Operating activities are the main source of revenue and expenditure in an
enterprise. Therefore, the ascertainment of cash flows from operating activities
need special attention.

Reprint 2025-26



Cash Flow Statement 249

As per AS-3,  an enterprise should report cash flows from operating
activities either by using :

 Direct method whereby major classes of gross cash receipts and gross
cash payments are disclosed;

or
 Indirect method whereby net profit or loss is duly adjusted for the

effects of (1) transactions of a non-cash nature, (2) any deferrals or
accruals of past/future operating cash receipts, and (3) items of
income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows.
It is important to mention here that under indirect method, the starting
point is net profit/loss before taxation and extra ordinary items as
per Statement of Profit and Loss of the enterprise. Then this amount
is for non-cash items, etc., adjusted for ascertaining cash flows from
operating activities.

Accordingly, cash flow from operating activities can be determined using
either the Direct method or the Indirect method.The direct method provides
information which is useful in estimating future cash flows. But such
information is not available under the indirect method. However, in practice,
indirect method is mostly used by the companies for arriving at the net cash
flow from operating activities. The Chapter deals with preparing cash flow
statement using indirect method.

Proposed Dividend
As per AS-4, Contingencies and Events Occurring after the Balance
Sheet Date, Proposed dividend is shown in the Notes to Accounts. It
will be shown as contingent liability since it becomes a liability after
it is declared (approved) by the shareholders. It will be accounted in
the books of account after it is declared (approved) by the
shareholders in the Annual General Meeting. Since, previous year's
Proposed Dividend will be declared (approved) in the current year;
previous year's Proposed Dividend will be accounted as dividend
payable. Also, declared dividend is paid within 30 days of its
declaration therefore; it will be paid within the same financial year.

Briefly, proposed dividend of previous year after declaration
(approved) by the shareholders will be debited to surplus i.e., Balance
in Statement of Profit and Loss. While preparing cash flow statement,
previous year's proposed dividend will be added to Act Profit under
operating activities and will be shown under financial activity.

6.6.1  Indirect Method
Indirect method of ascertaining cash flow from operating activities begins with
the amount of net profit/loss. This is so because statement of profit and loss
incorporates the effects of all operating activities of an enterprise. However,
Statement of Profit and Loss is prepared on accrual basis (and not on cash
basis). Moreover, it also includes certain non-operating items such as interest
paid, profit/loss on sale of fixed assets, etc.) and non-cash items (such as
depreciation, goodwill written-off, divident declared, etc. Therefore, it becomes
necessary to adjust the amount of net profit/loss as shown by Statement of
Profit and Loss for arriving at cash flows from operating activities. Let us look
at the example :

Statement of Profit and Loss Account
for the year ended March 31, 2017

Particulars Note Figures in
(Rs.)

i) Revenue from Operations 1,00,000
ii) Other Income 1 2,000
iii) Total Revenues (i+ii) 1,02,000
iv) Expenses

Cost of Materials Consumed  30,000
Purchases of stock-in-trade 10,000
Employees Benefits Expenses 10,000
Finance Costs 5,000
Depreciation 5,000
Other Expenses 12,000

72,000
v) Profit before Tax (iii-iv) 30,000

Note: Other income includes profit on sale of land.

The above Statement of Profit and Loss shows the amount of net profit of
Rs. 30,000. This has to be adjusted for arriving cash flows from operating
activities. Let us take various items one by one.

1. Depreciation is a non-cash item and hence, Rs. 5,000 charged as
depreciation does not result in any cash flow. Therefore, this amount
must be added back to the net profit.

2. Finance costs of Rs. 5,000 is a cash outflow on account of financing
activity. Therefore, this amount must also be added back to net
profit while calculating cash flows from operating activities. This
amount of finance cost will be shown as an outflow under the head
of financing activities.

Reprint 2025-26



Cash Flow Statement 251

3. Other income includes profit on sale of land: It is cash inflow from
investing activity. Hence, this amount must be deducted from the
amount of net profit while calculating cash flows from operating
activities.

The above example gives you an idea as to how various adjustments are
made in the amount of net profit/loss. Other important adjustments relate to
changes in working capital which are necessary (i.e., items of current assets
and current liabilities) to convert net profit/loss which is based on accrual
basis into cash flows from operating activities. Therefore, the increase in
current assets and decrease in current liabilities are deducted from the operating
profit, and the decrease in current assets and increase in current liabilities
are added to the  operating profit so as to arrive at the exact amount of net
cash flow from operating activities.
As per AS-3, under indirect method, net cash flow from operating activities is
determined by adjusting net profit or loss for the effect of :
 Non-cash items such as depreciation, goodwill written-off, provisions,

deferred taxes, etc., which are to be added back.
 All other items for which the cash effects are investing or financing cash

flows. The treatment of such items depends upon their nature. All investing
and financing incomes are to be deducted from the amount of net profits
while all such expenses are to be added back. For example, finance cost
which is a financing cash outflow is to be added back while other income
such as interest received which is investing cash inflow is to be deducted
from the amount of net profit. Dividend declared is a financial activity
and is therefore added back to net profit and shown as out flow under
financial activity.

 Changes in current assets and liabilities during the period. Increase in
current assets and decrease in current liabilities are to be deducted while
increase in current liabilities and decrease in current assets are to be
added up.

Exhibit 6.4 shows the proforma of calculating cash flows from operating
activities as per indirect method.

2. While computing cash from operating activities, indicate whether the
following items will be added or subtracted from the net profit- if not to
be considered, write NC

Items: Treatment
(a) Increase in the value of creditors
(b) Increase in the value of patents
(c) Decrease in prepaid expenses
(d) Decrease in income received in advance
(e) Decrease in value of inventory
(f) Increase in share capital
(g) Increase in the value of trade receivables
(h) Increase in the amount of outstanding expenses
(i) Conversion of debentures into shares
(j) Decrease in the value of trade payables

(k) Increase in the value of trade receivables
(l) Decrease in the amount of accrued income.

Sometimes, neither the amount of net profit is specified nor the Statement of
profit and loss is given. In such a situation, the amount of net profit can be
worked out by comparing the balances of Statement of Profit and Loss given
in the comparative balance sheets for two years. The difference is treated as
the net profit for the year; and, then, by adjusting it with the amount of
provision for tax made during the year (as worked out by comparing the
provision for tax balances of two years given in balance sheets), the amount of
‘Net Profit before tax’ can be ascertained (see Illustration 7 and 8).

6.7 Ascertainment of Cash Flow from Investing and Financing Activities
The details of item leading inflows and outflows from investing and financing
activities have already been outlined. While preparing the cash flow statement,
all major items of gross cash receipts, gross cash payments, and net cash flows
from investing and financing activities must be shown separately under the
headings ‘Cash Flow from Investing Activities’ and ‘Cash Flow from Financing
Activities’ respectively.’

The ascertainment of net cash flows from investing and financing activities
have been briefly dealt with in Illustrations 5 and 6.

Cash Flow Statement 261

6.8 Preparation of Cash Flow Statement
As stated earlier cash flow statement provides information about change in the
position of Cash and Cash Equivalents of an enterprise, over an accounting
period. The activities contributing to this change are classified into operating,
investing and financing. The methology of working out the net cash flow (or
use) from all the three activities for an accounting period has been explained
in details and a brief format of Cash Flow Statement has also been given in
Exhibit 6.2. However, while preparing a cash flow statement, full details of
inflows and outflows are given under these heads including the net cash flow
(or use). The aggregate of the net ‘cash flows (or use) is worked out and is
shown as ‘Net Increase/Decrease in cash and Cash Equivalents’ to which the
amount of ‘cash and cash equivalent at the beginning’ is added and thus the
amount of ‘cash and cash equivalents at the end’ is arrived at as shown in
Exhibit 6.2. This figure will be the same as the total amount of cash in hand,
cash at bank and cash equivalants (if any) given in the balance sheet (see
Illustrations 7 to 10). Another point that needs to be noted is that when cash
flows from operating activities are worked out by an indirect method and
shown as such in the cash flow statement, the statement itself is termed as
‘Indirect method cash flow statement’. Thus, the Cash flow statements prepared
in Illustrations 7, 8 and 9 fall under this category as the cash flows from
operating activities have been worked out by indirect method. Similarly, if the
cash flows from operating activities are worked by direct method while preparing
the cash flow statement, it will be termed as ‘direct method Cash Flow
Statement’. Illustration 10 shows both types of Cash Flow Statement. However,
unless it is specified clearly as to which method is to be used, the cash flow
statement may preferably be prepared by an indirect method as is done by
most companies in practice.
