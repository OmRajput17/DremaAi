1.1 Introduction
In Class IX, you began your exploration of the world of real numbers and encountered
irrational numbers. We continue our discussion on real numbers in this chapter. We
begin with very important properties of positive integers in Sections 1.2, namely the
Euclid’s division algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
Euclid’s division algorithm, as the name suggests, has to do with divisibility of
integers. Stated simply, it says any positive integer a can be divided by another positive
integer b in such a way that it leaves a remainder r that is smaller than b. Many of you
probably recognise this as the usual long division process. Although this result is quite
easy to state and understand, it has many applications related to the divisibility properties
of integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF of
two positive integers.
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do something
with multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite number
can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way — this important fact is the
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state and
understand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics.
We use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, we
use it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as
2 , 3 and 5 . Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal
p
expansion of a rational number, say (q  0) , is terminating and when it is nonq
terminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominator
p
q of . You will see that the prime factorisation of q will completely reveal the nature
q
of the decimal expansion of p .

So let us begin our exploration.

MATHEMATICS

1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
In your earlier classes, you have seen that any natural number can be written as a
product of its prime factors. For instance, 2 = 2, 4 = 2 × 2, 253 = 11 × 23, and so on.
Now, let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any
natural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see.
Take any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 11 and 23. If we multiply
some or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish,
we can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many).
Let us list a few :
7 × 11 × 23 = 1771

3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 5313

2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 10626

23 × 3 × 73 = 8232

22 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 21252
and so on.
Now, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes.
What is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite
number of integers, or infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So,
if we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite
collection of numbers, all
the primes and all possible
products of primes. The
question is – can we
produce all the composite
numbers this way? What
do you think? Do you
think that there may be a
composite number which
is not the product of
powers of primes?
Before we answer this,
let us factorise positive
integers, that is, do the
opposite of what we have
done so far.
We are going to use
the factor tree with which
you are all familiar. Let us
take some large number,
say, 32760, and factorise
it as shown.

REAL NUMBERS

So we have factorised 32760 as 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of
primes, i.e., 32760 = 23 × 32 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of powers of primes. Let us try
another number, say, 123456789. This can be written as 32 × 3803 × 3607. Of course,
you have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes! (Try it out for several other natural
numbers yourself.) This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be
written as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called
the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance
to the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem.
Theorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) : Every composite
number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation
is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.

An equivalent version of Theorem 1.2 was probably
first recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid’s
Elements, before it came to be known as the
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. However, the
first correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss
in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.
Carl Friedrich Gauss is often referred to as the ‘Prince
of Mathematicians’ and is considered one of the three
greatest mathematicians of all time, along with
Archimedes and Newton. He has made fundamental
contributions to both mathematics and science.

Carl Friedrich Gauss
(1777 – 1855)

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can
be factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any
composite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a ‘unique’
way, except for the order in which the primes occur. That is, given any composite
number there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes, as long as we
are not particular about the order in which the primes occur. So, for example, we
regard 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 as the same as 3 × 5 × 7 × 2, or any other possible order in which
these primes are written. This fact is also stated in the following form:
The prime factorisation of a natural number is unique, except for the order
of its factors.

MATHEMATICS

In general, given a composite number x, we factorise it as x = p1 p2 ... pn, where
p 1 , p 2 ,..., p n are primes and written in ascending order, i.e., p 1  p 2
 . . .  pn. If we combine the same primes, we will get powers of primes. For example,
32760 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 = 23 × 32 × 5 × 7 × 13
Once we have decided that the order will be ascending, then the way the number
is factorised, is unique.
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic has many applications, both within
mathematics and in other fields. Let us look at some examples.
Example 1 : Consider the numbers 4n, where n is a natural number. Check whether
there is any value of n for which 4n ends with the digit zero.
Solution : If the number 4n, for any n, were to end with the digit zero, then it would be
divisible by 5. That is, the prime factorisation of 4n would contain the prime 5. This is
not possible because 4n = (2)2n; so the only prime in the factorisation of 4n is 2. So, the
uniqueness of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees that there are no
other primes in the factorisation of 4n. So, there is no natural number n for which 4n
ends with the digit zero.
You have already learnt how to find the HCF and LCM of two positive integers
using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in earlier classes, without realising it!
This method is also called the prime factorisation method. Let us recall this method
through an example.
Example 2 : Find the LCM and HCF of 6 and 20 by the prime factorisation method.
Solution : We have :

6 = 21 × 31 and 20 = 2 × 2 × 5 = 22 × 51.

You can find HCF(6, 20) = 2 and LCM(6, 20) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 60, as done in your
earlier classes.
Note that HCF(6, 20) = 21 = Product of the smallest power of each common
prime factor in the numbers.
LCM (6, 20) = 22 × 31 × 51 = Product of the greatest power of each prime factor,
involved in the numbers.
From the example above, you might have noticed that HCF(6, 20) × LCM(6, 20)
= 6 × 20. In fact, we can verify that for any two positive integers a and b,
HCF (a, b) × LCM (a, b) = a × b. We can use this result to find the LCM of two
positive integers, if we have already found the HCF of the two positive integers.
Example 3: Find the HCF of 96 and 404 by the prime factorisation method. Hence,
find their LCM.

Solution : The prime factorisation of 96 and 404 gives :
96 = 25 × 3, 404 = 22 × 101
Therefore, the HCF of these two integers is 22 = 4.
Also,

LCM (96, 404) =

Example 4 : Find the HCF and LCM of 6, 72 and 120, using the prime factorisation
method.
Solution : We have :
6 = 2 × 3, 72 = 23 × 32, 120 = 23 × 3 × 5
Here, 21 and 31 are the smallest powers of the common factors 2 and 3, respectively.
HCF (6, 72, 120) = 21 × 31 = 2 × 3 = 6

So,

23, 32 and 51 are the greatest powers of the prime factors 2, 3 and 5 respectively
involved in the three numbers.
LCM (6, 72, 120) = 23 × 32 × 51 = 360

So,

Remark : Notice, 6 × 72 × 120  HCF (6, 72, 120) × LCM (6, 72, 120). So, the
product of three numbers is not equal to the product of their HCF and LCM.

1.3 Revisiting Irrational Numbers
In Class IX, you were introduced to irrational numbers and many of their properties.
You studied about their existence and how the rationals and the irrationals together
made up the real numbers. You even studied how to locate irrationals on the number
line. However, we did not prove that they were irrationals. In this section, we will
prove that 2 , 3 , 5 and, in general, p is irrational, where p is a prime. One of
the theorems, we use in our proof, is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
p
Recall, a number ‘s’ is called irrational if it cannot be written in the form ,
q
where p and q are integers and q ¹ 0. Some examples of irrational numbers, with
which you are already familiar, are :

2,
0.10110111011110 . . . , etc.
3
Before we prove that 2 is irrational, we need the following theorem, whose
proof is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
2, 3 , 15 ,  , 

Theorem 1.2 : Let p be a prime number. If p divides a2, then p divides a, where
a is a positive integer.
*Proof : Let the prime factorisation of a be as follows :
a = p1p2 . . . pn, where p1,p2, . . ., pn are primes, not necessarily distinct.
Therefore, a2 = ( p1 p2 . . . pn)( p1 p2 . . . pn) = p21 p22 . . . p2n.
Now, we are given that p divides a2. Therefore, from the Fundamental Theorem of
Arithmetic, it follows that p is one of the prime factors of a2. However, using the
uniqueness part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we realise that the only
prime factors of a2 are p1, p2, . . ., pn. So p is one of p1, p2, . . ., pn.
Now, since a = p1 p2 . . . pn , p divides a.
We are now ready to give a proof that

2 is irrational.
The proof is based on a technique called ‘proof by contradiction’. (This technique is
discussed in some detail in Appendix 1).

Theorem 1.3 :

2 is irrational.

Proof : Let us assume, to the contrary, that

2 is rational.

So, we can find integers r and s (¹ 0) such that

r
2 = s.

Suppose r and s have a common factor other than 1. Then, we divide by the common
factor to get

2

a , where a and b are coprime.
b

So, b 2 = a.
Squaring on both sides and rearranging, we get 2b2 = a2. Therefore, 2 divides a2.
Now, by Theorem 1.2, it follows that 2 divides a.
So, we can write a = 2c for some integer c.
Substituting for a, we get 2b2 = 4c2, that is, b2 = 2c2.
This means that 2 divides b2, and so 2 divides b (again using Theorem 1.2 with p = 2).
Therefore, a and b have at least 2 as a common factor.
But this contradicts the fact that a and b have no common factors other than 1.
This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that
So, we conclude that

2 is rational.

2 is irrational.

Example 5 : Prove that

3 is irrational.

Solution : Let us assume, to the contrary, that

3 is rational.

That is, we can find integers a and b (¹ 0) such that

a
3 = b

Suppose a and b have a common factor other than 1, then we can divide by the
common factor, and assume that a and b are coprime.
So, b 3  a 
Squaring on both sides, and rearranging, we get 3b2 = a2.
Therefore, a2 is divisible by 3, and by Theorem 1.2, it follows that a is also divisible
by 3.
So, we can write a = 3c for some integer c.
Substituting for a, we get 3b2 = 9c2, that is, b2 = 3c2.
This means that b2 is divisible by 3, and so b is also divisible by 3 (using Theorem 1.2
with p = 3).

Therefore, a and b have at least 3 as a common factor.
But this contradicts the fact that a and b are coprime.

In Class IX, we mentioned that :

2.1 Introduction
In Class IX, you have studied polynomials in one variable and their degrees. Recall
that if p(x) is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) is called the degree of
the polynomial p(x). For example, 4x + 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of
degree 1, 2y2 – 3y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, 5x3 – 4x2 + x –
is a polynomial in the variable x of degree 3 and 7u6 –
in the variable u of degree 6. Expressions like

quadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any
quadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers
and a  0. A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial. Some examples of

a cubic polynomial are 2 – x3, x3, 2 x3 , 3 – x2 + x3, 3x3 – 2x2 + x – 1. In fact, the most
general form of a cubic polynomial is
ax3 + bx2 + cx + d,
where, a, b, c, d are real numbers and a  0.
Now consider the polynomial p(x) = x2 – 3x – 4. Then, putting x = 2 in the
polynomial, we get p(2) = 22 – 3 × 2 – 4 = – 6. The value ‘– 6’, obtained by replacing
x by 2 in x2 – 3x – 4, is the value of x2 – 3x – 4 at x = 2. Similarly, p(0) is the value of
p(x) at x = 0, which is – 4.
If p(x) is a polynomial in x, and if k is any real number, then the value obtained by
replacing x by k in p(x), is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(k).
What is the value of p(x) = x2 –3x – 4 at x = –1? We have :
p(–1) = (–1)2 –{3 × (–1)} – 4 = 0
Also, note that

p(4) = 42 – (3  4) – 4 = 0.

As p(–1) = 0 and p(4) = 0, –1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic
polynomial x2 – 3x – 4. More generally, a real number k is said to be a zero of a
polynomial p(x), if p(k) = 0.
You have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear
polynomial. For example, if k is a zero of p(x) = 2x + 3, then p(k) = 0 gives us
3
2k + 3 = 0, i.e., k =  
2
b

In general, if k is a zero of p(x) = ax + b, then p(k) = ak + b = 0, i.e., k 
a
b  (Constant term)
So, the zero of the linear polynomial ax + b is
.

a
Coefficient of x
Thus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this
happen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic
polynomial also related to its coefficients?
In this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the
division algorithm for polynomials.

2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial
You know that a real number k is a zero of the polynomial p(x) if p(k) = 0. But why
are the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the
geometrical representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical
meaning of their zeroes.

the polynomial 2x + 3 is the
x-coordinate of the point where the

graph of y = 2x + 3 intersects the
x-axis.

In general, for a linear polynomial ax + b, a  0, the graph of y = ax + b is a

straight line which intersects the x-axis at exactly one point, namely,  , 0  .

Now, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial.
Consider the quadratic polynomial x2 – 3x – 4. Let us see what the graph* of
y = x2 – 3x – 4 looks like. Let us list a few values of y = x2 – 3x – 4 corresponding to
a few values for x as given in Table 2.1.

If we locate the points listed
above on a graph paper and draw
the graph, it will actually look like
the one given in Fig. 2.2.
In fact, for any quadratic
polynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, the
graph of the corresponding
equation y = ax2 + bx + c has one
of the two shapes either open
or open
upwards like
downwards like
depending on
whether a > 0 or a < 0. (These
curves are called parabolas.)
You can see from Table 2.1
that –1 and 4 are zeroes of the
quadratic polynomial. Also
note from Fig. 2.2 that –1 and 4
are the x-coordinates of the points
where the graph of y = x2 – 3x – 4
intersects the x- axis. Thus, the
zeroes of the quadratic polynomial
x2 – 3x – 4 are x-coordinates of
the points where the graph of
y = x 2 – 3x – 4 intersects the
x-axis.

Fig. 2.2

This fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic
polynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the
parabola representing y = ax2 + bx + c intersects the x-axis.
From our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c, the
following three cases can happen:

Reprint 2025-26

14

MATHEMATICS

Case (i) : Here, the graph cuts x-axis at two distinct points A and A.
The x-coordinates of A and A are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial
ax + bx + c in this case (see Fig. 2.3).
2

Fig. 2.3
Case (ii) : Here, the graph cuts the x-axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident
points. So, the two points A and A of Case (i) coincide here to become one point A
(see Fig. 2.4).

Fig. 2.4
The x-coordinate of A is the only zero for the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c
in this case.

Reprint 2025-26

POLYNOMIALS

15

Case (iii) : Here, the graph is either completely above the x-axis or completely below
the x-axis. So, it does not cut the x-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).

Fig. 2.5
So, the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c has no zero in this case.
So, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two
distinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a
polynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.
Now, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic
polynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial x3 – 4x. To see what
the graph of y = x3 – 4x looks like, let us list a few values of y corresponding to a few
values for x as shown in Table 2.2.

MATHEMATICS

We see from the table above
that – 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the
cubic polynomial x3 – 4x. Observe
that – 2, 0 and 2 are, in fact, the
x-coordinates of the only points
where the graph of y = x 3 – 4x
intersects the x-axis. Since the curve
meets the x - axis in only these 3
points, their x - coordinates are the
only zeroes of the polynomial.
Let us take a few more
examples. Consider the cubic
polynomials x3 and x3 – x2. We draw
the graphs of y = x3 and y = x3 – x2
in Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8 respectively.

Note that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial x3. Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see
that 0 is the x-coordinate of the only point where the graph of y = x3 intersects the
x-axis. Similarly, since x3 – x2 = x2 (x – 1), 0 and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial
x3 – x2. Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the x - coordinates of the only points
where the graph of y = x3 – x2 intersects the x-axis.
From the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic
polynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.
Remark : In general, given a polynomial p(x) of degree n, the graph of y = p(x)
intersects the x-axis at atmost n points. Therefore, a polynomial p(x) of degree n has
at most n zeroes.
Example 1 : Look at the graphs in Fig. 2.9 given below. Each is the graph of y = p(x),
where p(x) is a polynomial. For each of the graphs, find the number of zeroes of p(x).

Fig. 2.9
Solution :
(i) The number of zeroes is 1 as the graph intersects the x-axis at one point only.
(ii) The number of zeroes is 2 as the graph intersects the x-axis at two points.

2.3 Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial
You have already seen that zero of a linear polynomial ax + b is  b . We will now try

a

to answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes
and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,
say p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic
polynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term
‘– 8x’ as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 × 2x2 = 12x2. So, we write
2x2 – 8x + 6 = 2x2 – 6x – 2x + 6 = 2x(x – 3) – 2(x – 3)
= (2x – 2)(x – 3) = 2(x – 1)(x – 3)

Reprint 2025-26

POLYNOMIALS

19

So, the value of p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6 is zero when x – 1 = 0 or x – 3 = 0, i.e., when
x = 1 or x = 3. So, the zeroes of 2x2 – 8x + 6 are 1 and 3. Observe that :

Let us take one more quadratic polynomial, say, p(x) = 3x2 + 5x – 2. By the
method of splitting the middle term,
3x2 + 5x – 2 = 3x2 + 6x – x – 2 = 3x(x + 2) –1(x + 2)
= (3x – 1)(x + 2)
Hence, the value of 3x2 + 5x – 2 is zero when either 3x – 1 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, i.e.,
when x =

1
1
or x = –2. So, the zeroes of 3x2 + 5x – 2 are and – 2. Observe that :

In general, if * and * are the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial p(x) = ax2 + bx + c,
a  0, then you know that x –  and x –  are the factors of p(x). Therefore,
ax2 + bx + c = k(x – ) (x – ), where k is a constant
= k[x2 – ( + )x + ]
= kx2 – k( + )x + k 
Comparing the coefficients of x2, x and constant terms on both the sides, we get
a = k, b = – k( + ) and c = k
This gives

relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.
Solution : We have
x2 + 7x + 10 = (x + 2)(x + 5)
So, the value of x2 + 7x + 10 is zero when x + 2 = 0 or x + 5 = 0, i.e., when x = – 2 or
x = –5. Therefore, the zeroes of x2 + 7x + 10 are – 2 and – 5. Now,

be of the form k(x2 + 3x + 2), where k is real.

between the zeroes of a cubic polynomial and its coefficients?

PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS

3.1 Introduction
You must have come across situations like the one given below :
Akhila went to a fair in her village. She wanted to enjoy rides on the Giant Wheel
and play Hoopla (a game in which you throw a ring on the items kept in a stall, and if
the ring covers any object completely, you get it). The number of times she played
Hoopla is half the number of rides she had on the Giant Wheel. If each ride costs
` 3, and a game of Hoopla costs ` 4, how would you find out the number of rides she
had and how many times she played Hoopla, provided she spent ` 20.
May be you will try it by considering different cases. If she has one ride, is it
possible? Is it possible to have two rides? And so on. Or you may use the knowledge
of Class IX, to represent such situations as linear equations in two variables.

PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES

Let us try this approach.
Denote the number of rides that Akhila had by x, and the number of times she
played Hoopla by y. Now the situation can be represented by the two equations:

1
x
2
3x + 4y = 20

y=

(2)

Can we find the solutions of this pair of equations? There are several ways of
finding these, which we will study in this chapter.

3.2 Graphical Method of Solution of a Pair of Linear Equations
A pair of linear equations which has no solution, is called an inconsistent pair of linear
equations. A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is called a
consistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations which are equivalent has
infinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a dependent pair of
linear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of linear equations is
always consistent.
We can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations
in two variables and the existence of solutions as follows:
(i) the lines may intersect in a single point. In this case, the pair of equations
has a unique solution (consistent pair of equations).
(ii) the lines may be parallel. In this case, the equations have no solution
(inconsistent pair of equations).
(iii) the lines may be coincident. In this case, the equations have infinitely many
solutions [dependent (consistent) pair of equations].
Consider the following three pairs of equations.
(i) x – 2y = 0 and 3x + 4y – 20 = 0
(The lines intersect)
(ii) 2x + 3y – 9 = 0 and 4x + 6y – 18 = 0 (The lines coincide)
(iii) x + 2y – 4 = 0 and 2x + 4y – 12 = 0
(The lines are parallel)
Let us now write down, and compare, the values of

a1 , b1

We observe that there is a point
B (6, 0) common to both the lines

y = 0, i.e., the given pair of equations
is consistent.

and (2) are coincident. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions.
Plot few points on the graph and verify it yourself.

several algebraic methods, which we shall now discuss.

3.3.1 Substitution Method : We shall explain the method of substitution by taking
some examples.
Example 4 : Solve the following pair of equations by substitution method:
7x – 15y = 2

(1)

x + 2y = 3

Solution :
Step 1 : We pick either of the equations and write one variable in terms of the other.
Let us consider the Equation (2) :
x + 2y = 3
and write it as

x = 3 – 2y

Step 2 : Substitute the value of x in Equation (1). We get
7(3 – 2y) – 15y = 2
i.e.,
i.e.,

21 – 14y – 15y = 2

and y =

(1) and (2) are satisfied.
To understand the substitution method more clearly, let us consider it stepwise:
Step 1 : Find the value of one variable, say y in terms of the other variable, i.e., x from
either equation, whichever is convenient.
Step 2 : Substitute this value of y in the other equation, and reduce it to an equation in
one variable, i.e., in terms of x, which can be solved. Sometimes, as in Examples 9 and
10 below, you can get statements with no variable. If this statement is true, you can
conclude that the pair of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. If the statement
is false, then the pair of linear equations is inconsistent.
Step 3 : Substitute the value of x (or y) obtained in Step 2 in the equation used in
Step 1 to obtain the value of the other variable.
Remark : We have substituted the value of one variable by expressing it in terms of
the other variable to solve the pair of linear equations. That is why the method is
known as the substitution method.
Example 5 : Solve the following question—Aftab tells his daughter, “Seven years
ago, I was seven times as old as you were then. Also, three years from now, I shall be
three times as old as you will be.” (Isn’t this interesting?) Represent this situation
algebraically and graphically by the method of substitution.
Solution : Let s and t be the ages (in years) of Aftab and his daughter, respectively.
Then, the pair of linear equations that represent the situation is
and

s – 7 = 7 (t – 7), i.e., s – 7t + 42 = 0

(1)

s + 3 = 3 (t + 3), i.e., s – 3t = 6

(2)

Using Equation (2), we get s = 3t + 6.
Putting this value of s in Equation (1), we get
(3t + 6) – 7t + 42 = 0,
i.e.,

4t = 48, which gives t = 12.

Putting this value of t in Equation (2), we get
s = 3 (12) + 6 = 42

So, Aftab and his daughter are 42 and 12 years old, respectively.
Verify this answer by checking if it satisfies the conditions of the given problems.
Example 6 : In a shop the cost of 2 pencils and 3 erasers is `9 and the cost of 4
pencils and 6 erasers is `18. Find the cost of each pencil and each eraser.
Solution : The pair of linear equations formed were:
2x + 3y = 9

(1)

4x + 6y = 18

(2)

We first express the value of x in terms of y from the equation 2x + 3y = 9, to get
x=

9 − 3y
2

(3)

Now we substitute this value of x in Equation (2), to get

i.e.,

4(9 − 3 y )
+ 6y = 18
2
18 – 6y + 6y = 18

i.e.,

18 = 18

This statement is true for all values of y. However, we do not get a specific
value of y as a solution. Therefore, we cannot obtain a specific value of x. This
situation has arisen because both the given equations are the same. Therefore,
Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions. We cannot find a unique
cost of a pencil and an eraser, because there are many common solutions, to the
given situation.
Example 7 : Two rails are represented by the equations
x + 2y – 4 = 0 and 2x + 4y – 12 = 0. Will the rails cross each other?
Solution : The pair of linear equations formed were:
x + 2y – 4 = 0
2x + 4y – 12 = 0
We express x in terms of y from Equation (1) to get
x = 4 – 2y
Now, we substitute this value of x in Equation (2) to get
2(4 – 2y) + 4y – 12 = 0

3.3.2 Elimination Method
Now let us consider another method of eliminating (i.e., removing) one variable. This
is sometimes more convenient than the substitution method. Let us see how this method
works.
Example 8 : The ratio of incomes of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their
expenditures is 4 : 3. If each of them manages to save ` 2000 per month, find their
monthly incomes.
Solution : Let us denote the incomes of the two person by ` 9x and ` 7x and their
expenditures by ` 4y and ` 3y respectively. Then the equations formed in the situation
is given by :
and

9x – 4y = 2000

(1)

7x – 3y = 2000

(2)

Step 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 3 and Equation (2) by 4 to make the coefficients of
y equal. Then we get the equations:
27x – 12y = 6000

(3)

28x – 12y = 8000

(4)

Step 2 : Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4) to eliminate y, because the coefficients
of y are the same. So, we get
(28x – 27x) – (12y – 12y) = 8000 – 6000
i.e.,

x = 2000

Step 3 : Substituting this value of x in (1), we get
9(2000) – 4y = 2000
i.e.,
y = 4000
So, the solution of the equations is x = 2000, y = 4000. Therefore, the monthly incomes
of the persons are ` 18,000 and ` 14,000, respectively.
Verification : 18000 : 14000 = 9 : 7. Also, the ratio of their expenditures =
18000 – 2000 : 14000 – 2000 = 16000 : 12000 = 4 : 3
Remarks :
1. The method used in solving the example above is called the elimination method,
because we eliminate one variable first, to get a linear equation in one variable.

Reprint 2025-26

PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES

35

In the example above, we eliminated y. We could also have eliminated x. Try
doing it that way.
2. You could also have used the substitution, or graphical method, to solve this
problem. Try doing so, and see which method is more convenient.
Let us now note down these steps in the elimination method :
Step 1 : First multiply both the equations by some suitable non-zero constants to make
the coefficients of one variable (either x or y) numerically equal.
Step 2 : Then add or subtract one equation from the other so that one variable gets
eliminated. If you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3.
If in Step 2, we obtain a true statement involving no variable, then the original
pair of equations has infinitely many solutions.
If in Step 2, we obtain a false statement involving no variable, then the original
pair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent.
Step 3 : Solve the equation in one variable (x or y) so obtained to get its value.
Step 4 : Substitute this value of x (or y) in either of the original equations to get the
value of the other variable.
Now to illustrate it, we shall solve few more examples.
Example 9 : Use elimination method to find all possible solutions of the following pair
of linear equations :
(1)
2x + 3y = 8
4x + 6y = 7
(2)
Solution :
Step 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 2 and Equation (2) by 1 to make the
coefficients of x equal. Then we get the equations as :
4x + 6y = 16
(3)
4x + 6y = 7
(4)
Step 2 : Subtracting Equation (4) from Equation (3),
(4x – 4x) + (6y – 6y) = 16 – 7
i.e.,
0 = 9, which is a false statement.
Therefore, the pair of equations has no solution.
Example 10 : The sum of a two-digit number and the number obtained by reversing
the digits is 66. If the digits of the number differ by 2, find the number. How many such
numbers are there?

Reprint 2025-26

36

MATHEMATICS

Solution : Let the ten’s and the unit’s digits in the first number be x and y, respectively.
So, the first number may be written as 10 x + y in the expanded form (for example,
56 = 10(5) + 6).
When the digits are reversed, x becomes the unit’s digit and y becomes the ten’s
digit. This number, in the expanded notation is 10y + x (for example, when 56 is
reversed, we get 65 = 10(6) + 5).
According to the given condition.
(10x + y) + (10y + x) = 66
i.e.,
11(x + y) = 66
i.e.,
x+y= 6
(1)
We are also given that the digits differ by 2, therefore,
either
x–y= 2
(2)
or
y–x= 2
(3)
If x – y = 2, then solving (1) and (2) by elimination, we get x = 4 and y = 2.
In this case, we get the number 42.
If y – x = 2, then solving (1) and (3) by elimination, we get x = 2 and y = 4.
In this case, we get the number 24.
Thus, there are two such numbers 42 and 24.
Verification : Here 42 + 24 = 66 and 4 – 2 = 2. Also 24 + 42 = 66 and 4 – 2 = 2.

4.1 Introduction
In Chapter 2, you have studied different types of polynomials. One type was the
quadratic polynomial of the form ax2 + bx + c, a  0. When we equate this polynomial
to zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with
many real-life situations. For instance, suppose a
charity trust decides to build a prayer hall having
a carpet area of 300 square metres with its length
one metre more than twice its breadth. What
should be the length and breadth of the hall?
Suppose the breadth of the hall is x metres. Then,
its length should be (2x + 1) metres. We can depict
Fig. 4.1
this information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1.
Now,

area of the hall = (2x + 1). x m2 = (2x2 + x) m2
2x2 + x = 300

So,
Therefore,

(Given)

2

2x + x – 300 = 0

So, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation 2x2 + x – 300 = 0 which is a
quadratic equation.
Many people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations.
For instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum
and a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic
equation of the form x2 – px + q = 0. Greek mathematician Euclid developed a
geometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology,
are solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is
often credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598–665)
gave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx = c. Later,

Sridharacharya (C.E. 1025) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula,
(as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completing
the square. An Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studied
quadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, in his book
‘Liber embadorum’ published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions of
different quadratic equations.
In this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding
their roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily life
situations.

4.2 Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation in the variable x is an equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where
a, b, c are real numbers, a  0. For example, 2x2 + x – 300 = 0 is a quadratic equation.
Similarly, 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0, 4x – 3x2 + 2 = 0 and 1 – x2 + 300 = 0 are also quadratic
equations.
In fact, any equation of the form p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree
2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of p(x) in descending order of
their degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, ax2 + bx + c = 0,
a  0 is called the standard form of a quadratic equation.
Quadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in
different fields of mathematics. Let us consider a few examples.
Example 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically:
(i)

John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and
the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find
out how many marbles they had to start with.

(ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of
production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys
produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was
` 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day.
Solution :
(i)

Let the number of marbles John had be x.
Then the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 – x (Why?).
The number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x – 5
The number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 – x – 5
= 40 – x

Reprint 2025-26

40

MATHEMATICS

Therefore, their product = (x – 5) (40 – x)
= 40x – x2 – 200 + 5x
= – x2 + 45x – 200
So,

– x2 + 45x – 200 = 124

i.e.,

– x2 + 45x – 324 = 0

i.e.,

x2 – 45x + 324 = 0

(Given that product = 124)

Therefore, the number of marbles John had, satisfies the quadratic equation
x2 – 45x + 324 = 0
which is the required representation of the problem mathematically.
(ii) Let the number of toys produced on that day be x.
Therefore, the cost of production (in rupees) of each toy that day = 55 – x
So, the total cost of production (in rupees) that day = x (55 – x)
Therefore,

x (55 – x) = 750

i.e.,

55x – x2 = 750

i.e.,

– x2 + 55x – 750 = 0

i.e.,

x2 – 55x + 750 = 0

Therefore, the number of toys produced that day satisfies the quadratic equation
x2 – 55x + 750 = 0
which is the required representation of the problem mathematically.
Example 2 : Check whether the following are quadratic equations:
(i) (x – 2)2 + 1 = 2x – 3

(ii) x(x + 1) + 8 = (x + 2) (x – 2)

(iii) x (2x + 3) = x2 + 1

(iv) (x + 2)3 = x3 – 4

Solution :
(i) LHS = (x – 2)2 + 1 = x2 – 4x + 4 + 1 = x2 – 4x + 5
Therefore, (x – 2)2 + 1 = 2x – 3 can be rewritten as
x2 – 4x + 5 = 2x – 3
i.e.,

x2 – 6x + 8 = 0

It is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0.
Therefore, the given equation is a quadratic equation.

Reprint 2025-26

QUADRATIC EQUATIONS

41

(ii) Since x(x + 1) + 8 = x2 + x + 8 and (x + 2)(x – 2) = x2 – 4
Therefore,
x2 + x + 8 = x2 – 4
i.e.,
x + 12 = 0
2
It is not of the form ax + bx + c = 0.
Therefore, the given equation is not a quadratic equation.
(iii) Here,
LHS = x (2x + 3) = 2x2 + 3x
So,
x (2x + 3) = x2 + 1 can be rewritten as
2x2 + 3x = x2 + 1
Therefore, we get
x2 + 3x – 1 = 0
It is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0.
So, the given equation is a quadratic equation.
(iv) Here,
LHS = (x + 2)3 = x3 + 6x2 + 12x + 8
Therefore,
(x + 2)3 = x3 – 4 can be rewritten as
x3 + 6x2 + 12x + 8 = x3 – 4
i.e.,
6x2 + 12x + 12 = 0 or, x2 + 2x + 2 = 0
It is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0.
So, the given equation is a quadratic equation.
Remark : Be careful! In (ii) above, the given equation appears to be a quadratic
equation, but it is not a quadratic equation.
In (iv) above, the given equation appears to be a cubic equation (an equation of
degree 3) and not a quadratic equation. But it turns out to be a quadratic equation. As
you can see, often we need to simplify the given equation before deciding whether it
is quadratic or not.

4.3 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Factorisation
Consider the quadratic equation 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. If we replace x by 1 on the
LHS of this equation, we get (2 × 12) – (3 × 1) + 1 = 0 = RHS of the equation.
We say that 1 is a root of the quadratic equation 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. This also means that
1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial 2x2 – 3x + 1.
In general, a real number  is called a root of the quadratic equation
ax + bx + c = 0, a  0 if a 2 + b + c = 0. We also say that x =  is a solution of
the quadratic equation, or that  satisfies the quadratic equation. Note that the
zeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic
equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are the same.
2

You have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most
two zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots.
You have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting
their middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic
equation. Let us see how.
Example 3 : Find the roots of the equation 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation.
Solution : Let us first split the middle term – 5x as –2x –3x [because (–2x) × (–3x) =
6x2 = (2x2) × 3].
So,

2x2 – 5x + 3 = 2x2 – 2x – 3x + 3 = 2x (x – 1) –3(x – 1) = (2x – 3)(x – 1)

Now, 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 can be rewritten as (2x – 3)(x – 1) = 0.
So, the values of x for which 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 are the same for which (2x – 3)(x – 1) = 0,
i.e., either 2x – 3 = 0 or x – 1 = 0.
3
Now, 2x – 3 = 0 gives x  and x – 1 = 0 gives x = 1.

So,

Note that we have found the roots of 2x 2 – 5x + 3 = 0 by factorising

Solution : We have
6x2 – x – 2 = 6x2 + 3x – 4x – 2
= 3x (2x + 1) – 2 (2x + 1)
= (3x – 2)(2x + 1)
The roots of 6x2 – x – 2 = 0 are the values of x for which (3x – 2)(2x + 1) = 0
Therefore, 3x – 2 = 0 or 2x + 1 = 0,

Example 6 : Find the dimensions of the prayer hall discussed in Section 4.1.
Solution : In Section 4.1, we found that if the breadth of the hall is x m, then x
satisfies the equation 2x2 + x – 300 = 0. Applying the factorisation method, we write
this equation as
2x2 – 24x + 25x – 300 = 0
2x (x – 12) + 25 (x – 12) = 0
i.e.,

(x – 12)(2x + 25) = 0

So, the roots of the given equation are x = 12 or x = – 12.5. Since x is the breadth
of the hall, it cannot be negative.
Thus, the breadth of the hall is 12 m. Its length = 2x + 1 = 25 m.

So, the roots of the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are both

b

2a

Therefore, we say that the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has two equal
real roots in this case.
If b2 – 4ac < 0, then there is no real number whose square is b2 – 4ac. Therefore,
there are no real roots for the given quadratic equation in this case.
Since b2 – 4ac determines whether the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has
real roots or not, b2 – 4ac is called the discriminant of this quadratic equation.
So, a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has
(i) two distinct real roots, if b2 – 4ac > 0,
(ii) two equal real roots, if b2 – 4ac = 0,
(iii) no real roots, if b2 – 4ac < 0.
Let us consider some examples.
Example 7: Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation 2x2 – 4x + 3 = 0, and
hence find the nature of its roots.
Solution : The given equation is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 2, b = – 4 and
c = 3. Therefore, the discriminant
b2 – 4ac = (– 4)2 – (4 × 2 × 3) = 16 – 24 = – 8 < 0
So, the given equation has no real roots.
Example 8 : A pole has to be erected at a point on the boundary of a circular park of
diameter 13 metres in such a way that the differences of its distances from two
diametrically opposite fixed gates A and B on the boundary is 7 metres. Is it possible to
do so? If yes, at what distances from the two gates should the pole be erected?
Solution : Let us first draw the diagram
(see Fig. 4.2).
Let P be the required location of the
pole. Let the distance of the pole from the
gate B be x m, i.e., BP = x m. Now the
difference of the distances of the pole from
the two gates = AP – BP (or, BP – AP) =
7 m. Therefore, AP = (x + 7) m.

MATHEMATICS

Now, AB = 13m, and since AB is a diameter,
Therefore,

APB = 90°
AP + PB2 = AB2

i.e.,

(x + 7)2 + x2 = 132

i.e.,

x2 + 14x + 49 + x2 = 169

i.e.,

2x2 + 14x – 120 = 0

(Why?)
(By Pythagoras theorem)

2

So, the distance ‘x’ of the pole from gate B satisfies the equation
x2 + 7x – 60 = 0
So, it would be possible to place the pole if this equation has real roots. To see if this
is so or not, let us consider its discriminant. The discriminant is
b2 – 4ac = 72 – 4 × 1 × (– 60) = 289 > 0.
So, the given quadratic equation has two real roots, and it is possible to erect the
pole on the boundary of the park.
Solving the quadratic equation x2 + 7x – 60 = 0, by the quadratic formula, we get
x=

7 

289
2

=

7  17
2

Therefore, x = 5 or – 12.
Since x is the distance between the pole and the gate B, it must be positive.
Therefore, x = – 12 will have to be ignored. So, x = 5.
Thus, the pole has to be erected on the boundary of the park at a distance of 5m
from the gate B and 12m from the gate A.
Example 9 : Find the discriminant of the equation 3x2 – 2x +

1. A quadratic equation in the variable x is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, c are real
numbers and a  0.

5.1 Introduction
You must have observed that in nature, many things follow a certain pattern, such as
the petals of a sunflower, the holes of a honeycomb, the grains on a maize cob, the
spirals on a pineapple and on a pine cone, etc.
We now look for some patterns which occur in our day-to-day life. Some such
examples are :

has been offered a job with a starting monthly
salary of ` 8000, with an annual increment of

In the examples above, we observe some patterns. In some, we find that the
succeeding terms are obtained by adding a fixed number, in other by multiplying
with a fixed number, in another we find that they are squares of consecutive
numbers, and so on.
In this chapter, we shall discuss one of these patterns in which succeeding terms
are obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. We shall also see how
to find their nth terms and the sum of n consecutive terms, and use this knowledge in
solving some daily life problems.

5.2 Arithmetic Progressions
Consider the following lists of numbers :
(i) 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .
(ii) 100, 70, 40, 10, . . .
(iii) – 3, –2, –1, 0, . . .
(iv) 3, 3, 3, 3, . . .
(v) –1.0, –1.5, –2.0, –2.5, . . .
Each of the numbers in the list is called a term.
Given a term, can you write the next term in each of the lists above? If so, how
will you write it? Perhaps by following a pattern or rule. Let us observe and write the
rule.
In (i), each term is 1 more than the term preceding it.
In (ii), each term is 30 less than the term preceding it.
In (iii), each term is obtained by adding 1 to the term preceding it.
In (iv), all the terms in the list are 3 , i.e., each term is obtained by adding
(or subtracting) 0 to the term preceding it.
In (v), each term is obtained by adding – 0.5 to (i.e., subtracting 0.5 from) the
term preceding it.
In all the lists above, we see that successive terms are obtained by adding a fixed
number to the preceding terms. Such list of numbers is said to form an Arithmetic
Progression ( AP ).
So, an arithmetic progression is a list of numbers in which each term is
obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term except the first
term.
This fixed number is called the common difference of the AP. Remember that
it can be positive, negative or zero.

52

MATHEMATICS

Let us denote the first term of an AP by a1, second term by a2, . . ., nth term by
an and the common difference by d. Then the AP becomes a1, a2, a3, . . ., an.
So,

a2 – a1 = a3 – a2 = . . . = an – an – 1 = d.

Some more examples of AP are:
(a) The heights ( in cm ) of some students of a school standing in a queue in the
morning assembly are 147 , 148, 149, . . ., 157.
(b) The minimum temperatures ( in degree celsius ) recorded for a week in the
month of January in a city, arranged in ascending order are
– 3.1, – 3.0, – 2.9, – 2.8, – 2.7, – 2.6, – 2.5
(c) The balance money ( in ` ) after paying 5 % of the total loan of ` 1000 every
month is 950, 900, 850, 800, . . ., 50.
(d) The cash prizes ( in ` ) given by a school to the toppers of Classes I to XII are,
respectively, 200, 250, 300, 350, . . ., 750.
(e) The total savings (in `) after every month for 10 months when ` 50 are saved
each month are 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500.
It is left as an exercise for you to explain why each of the lists above is an AP.
You can see that
a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, . . .
represents an arithmetic progression where a is the first term and d the common
difference. This is called the general form of an AP.
Note that in examples (a) to (e) above, there are only a finite number of terms.
Such an AP is called a finite AP. Also note that each of these Arithmetic Progressions
(APs) has a last term. The APs in examples (i) to (v) in this section, are not finite APs
and so they are called infinite Arithmetic Progressions. Such APs do not have a
last term.
Now, to know about an AP, what is the minimum information that you need? Is it
enough to know the first term? Or, is it enough to know only the common difference?
You will find that you will need to know both – the first term a and the common
difference d.
For instance if the first term a is 6 and the common difference d is 3, then
the AP is
6, 9,12, 15, . . .
and if a is 6 and d is – 3, then the AP is
6, 3, 0, –3, . . .

Similarly, when
a = – 7,

d = – 2,

the AP is – 7, – 9, – 11, – 13, . . .

a = 1.0,

d = 0.1,

the AP is 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, . . .

a = 0,

d=1

a = 2,

d = 0,

1
, the AP is 0, 1 , 3, 4 , 6, . . .
2

2
the AP is 2, 2, 2, 2, . . .

So, if you know what a and d are, you can list the AP. What about the other way
round? That is, if you are given a list of numbers can you say that it is an AP and then
find a and d? Since a is the first term, it can easily be written. We know that in an AP,
every succeeding term is obtained by adding d to the preceding term. So, d found by
subtracting any term from its succeeding term, i.e., the term which immediately follows
it should be same for an AP.
For example, for the list of numbers :
We have

6, 9, 12, 15, . . . ,
a2 – a1 = 9 – 6 = 3,
a3 – a2 = 12 – 9 = 3,
a4 – a3 = 15 – 12 = 3

Here the difference of any two consecutive terms in each case is 3. So, the
given list is an AP whose first term a is 6 and common difference d is 3.
For the list of numbers : 6, 3, 0, – 3, . . .,
a2 – a1 = 3 – 6 = – 3
a 3 – a2 = 0 – 3 = – 3
a4 – a3 = –3 – 0 = –3
Similarly this is also an AP whose first term is 6 and the common difference
is –3.
In general, for an AP a1, a2, . . ., an, we have
d = ak + 1 – ak
where ak + 1 and ak are the ( k + 1)th and the kth terms respectively.
To obtain d in a given AP, we need not find all of a2 – a1, a3 – a2, a4 – a3, . . . .
It is enough to find only one of them.
Consider the list of numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, . . . . By looking at it, you can tell that the
difference between any two consecutive terms is not the same. So, this is not an AP.

Reprint 2025-26

54

MATHEMATICS

Note that to find d in the AP : 6, 3, 0, – 3, . . ., we have subtracted 6 from 3
and not 3 from 6, i.e., we should subtract the kth term from the (k + 1) th term
even if the (k + 1) th term is smaller.
Let us make the concept more clear through some examples.
Example 1 : For the AP :

Remember that we can find d using any two consecutive terms, once we know that
the numbers are in AP.
Example 2 : Which of the following list of numbers form an AP? If they form an AP,
write the next two terms :
(i) 4, 10, 16, 22, . . .

(ii) 1, – 1, – 3, – 5, . . .

(iii) – 2, 2, – 2, 2, – 2, . . .

(iv) 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, . . .

Solution : (i) We have a2 – a1 = 10 – 4 = 6
a3 – a2 = 16 – 10 = 6
a4 – a3 = 22 – 16 = 6
i.e.,

ak + 1 – ak is the same every time.

So, the given list of numbers forms an AP with the common difference d = 6.
The next two terms are: 22 + 6 = 28 and 28 + 6 = 34.
(ii) a2 – a1 = – 1 – 1 = – 2
a3 – a2 = – 3 – ( –1 ) = – 3 + 1 = – 2
a4 – a3 = – 5 – ( –3 ) = – 5 + 3 = – 2
i.e., ak + 1 – ak is the same every time.
So, the given list of numbers forms an AP with the common difference d = – 2.
The next two terms are:
– 5 + (– 2 ) = – 7
and
– 7 + (– 2 ) = – 9
(iii) a2 – a1 = 2 – (– 2) = 2 + 2 = 4
a3 – a2 = – 2 – 2 = – 4
As a2 – a1  a3 – a2 , the given list of numbers does not form an AP.

(iv) a2 – a1 = 1 – 1 = 0
a3 – a2 = 1 – 1 = 0

So, the given list of numbers does not form an AP.

5.3 nth Term of an AP
Let us consider the situation again, given in Section 5.1 in which Reena applied for a
job and got selected. She has been offered the job with a starting monthly salary of
` 8000, with an annual increment of ` 500. What would be her monthly salary for the
fifth year?
To answer this, let us first see what her monthly salary for the second year
would be.
It would be ` (8000 + 500) = ` 8500. In the same way, we can find the monthly
salary for the 3rd, 4th and 5th year by adding ` 500 to the salary of the previous year.
So, the salary for the 3rd year = ` (8500 + 500)
= ` (8000 + 500 + 500)
= ` (8000 + 2 × 500)
(for the 3rd year)
= ` [8000 + (3 – 1) × 500]

Now, looking at the pattern formed above, can you find her monthly salary for
the 6th year? The 15th year? And, assuming that she will still be working in the job,
what about the monthly salary for the 25th year? You would calculate this by adding
` 500 each time to the salary of the previous year to give the answer. Can we make
this process shorter? Let us see. You may have already got some idea from the way
we have obtained the salaries above.

i.e.,

First salary + (15 – 1) × Annual increment.
In the same way, her monthly salary for the 25th year would be
` [8000 + (25 – 1) × 500] = ` 20000

= First salary + (25 – 1) × Annual increment
This example would have given you some idea about how to write the 15th term,
or the 25th term, and more generally, the nth term of the AP.
Let a1 , a2 , a3 , . . . be an AP whose first term a 1 is a and the common
difference is d.
Then,
the second term a2 = a + d = a + (2 – 1) d
the third term

a3 = a2 + d = (a + d) + d = a + 2d = a + (3 – 1) d

the fourth term

a4 = a3 + d = (a + 2d) + d = a + 3d = a + (4 – 1) d
........
........

Looking at the pattern, we can say that the nth term an = a + (n – 1) d.
So, the nth term an of the AP with first term a and common difference d is
given by an = a + (n – 1) d.

MATHEMATICS

an is also called the general term of the AP. If there are m terms in the AP, then
am represents the last term which is sometimes also denoted by l.
Let us consider some examples.
Example 3 : Find the 10th term of the AP : 2, 7, 12, . . .
Solution : Here, a = 2,

d=7–2=5

and

n = 10.

We have

an = a + (n – 1) d

So,

a10 = 2 + (10 – 1) × 5 = 2 + 45 = 47

Therefore, the 10th term of the given AP is 47.
Example 4 : Which term of the AP : 21, 18, 15, . . . is – 81? Also, is any term 0? Give
reason for your answer.
Solution : Here, a = 21, d = 18 – 21 = – 3 and an = – 81, and we have to find n.
As
we have

an = a + ( n – 1) d,
– 81 = 21 + (n – 1)(– 3)
– 81 = 24 – 3n
– 105 = – 3n

So,
n = 35
Therefore, the 35th term of the given AP is – 81.
Next, we want to know if there is any n for which an = 0. If such an n is there, then
21 + (n – 1) (–3) = 0,
i.e.,

3(n – 1) = 21

i.e.,
So, the eighth term is 0.

n= 8

Example 5 : Determine the AP whose 3rd term is 5 and the 7th term is 9.
Solution : We have
and

a3 = a + (3 – 1) d = a + 2d = 5

(1)

a7 = a + (7 – 1) d = a + 6d = 9

(2)

Solving the pair of linear equations (1) and (2), we get
a = 3, d = 1
Hence, the required AP is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . . .

Example 6 : Check whether 301 is a term of the list of numbers 5, 11, 17, 23, . . .
Solution : We have :
a2 – a1 = 11 – 5 = 6,

a3 – a2 = 17 – 11 = 6,

a4 – a3 = 23 – 17 = 6

As ak + 1 – ak is the same for k = 1, 2, 3, etc., the given list of numbers is an AP.
Now,

a=5

and

d = 6.

Let 301 be a term, say, the nth term of this AP.
We know that
an = a + (n – 1) d
So,

301 = 5 + (n – 1) × 6

i.e.,

301 = 6n – 1

So,

n=

302 151


3

But n should be a positive integer (Why?). So, 301 is not a term of the given list of
numbers.
Example 7 : How many two-digit numbers are divisible by 3?
Solution : The list of two-digit numbers divisible by 3 is :
12, 15, 18, . . . , 99
Is this an AP? Yes it is. Here,

a = 12, d = 3, an = 99.

As

an = a + (n – 1) d,

we have

99 = 12 + (n – 1) × 3

i.e.,

87 = (n – 1) × 3

i.e.,
i.e.,

n–1=

87
= 29
3

n = 29 + 1 = 30

So, there are 30 two-digit numbers divisible by 3.
Example 8 : Find the 11th term from the last term (towards the first term) of the
AP : 10, 7, 4, . . ., – 62.
Solution : Here,
where

a = 10, d = 7 – 10 = – 3, l = – 62,
l = a + (n – 1) d

Reprint 2025-26

60

MATHEMATICS

To find the 11th term from the last term, we will find the total number of terms in
the AP.
So,

– 62 = 10 + (n – 1)(–3)

i.e.,

– 72 = (n – 1)(–3)

i.e.,

n – 1 = 24

or

n = 25

So, there are 25 terms in the given AP.
The 11th term from the last term will be the 15th term. (Note that it will not be
the 14th term. Why?)
So,

a15 = 10 + (15 – 1)(–3) = 10 – 42 = – 32

i.e., the 11th term from the last term is – 32.
Alternative Solution :
If we write the given AP in the reverse order, then a = – 62 and d = 3 (Why?)
So, the question now becomes finding the 11th term with these a and d.
So,

a11 = – 62 + (11 – 1) × 3 = – 62 + 30 = – 32

So, the 11th term, which is now the required term, is – 32.
Example 9 : A sum of ` 1000 is invested at 8% simple interest per year. Calculate the
interest at the end of each year. Do these interests form an AP? If so, find the interest
at the end of 30 years making use of this fact.
Solution : We know that the formula to calculate simple interest is given by

P× R × T
100
1000 × 8 ×1
So, the interest at the end of the 1st year = `
= ` 80
100
1000 × 8 × 2
= ` 160
The interest at the end of the 2nd year = `
100
1000 × 8 × 3
= ` 240
The interest at the end of the 3rd year = `
100
Simple Interest =

Similarly, we can obtain the interest at the end of the 4th year, 5th year, and so on.
So, the interest (in `) at the end of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . . years, respectively are
80, 160, 240, . . .

It is an AP as the difference between the consecutive terms in the list is 80, i.e.,
d = 80. Also, a = 80.
So, to find the interest at the end of 30 years, we shall find a30.
Now,

a30 = a + (30 – 1) d = 80 + 29 × 80 = 2400

So, the interest at the end of 30 years will be ` 2400.
Example 10 : In a flower bed, there are 23 rose plants in the first row, 21 in the
second, 19 in the third, and so on. There are 5 rose plants in the last row. How many
rows are there in the flower bed?
Solution : The number of rose plants in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., rows are :
23, 21, 19, . . ., 5
It forms an AP (Why?). Let the number of rows in the flower bed be n.
Then

a = 23,

d = 21 – 23 = – 2, an = 5

As,

an = a + (n – 1) d

We have,

5 = 23 + (n – 1)(– 2)

i.e.,

– 18 = (n – 1)(– 2)

i.e.,

n = 10

So, there are 10 rows in the flower bed.

5.4 Sum of First n Terms of an AP
Let us consider the situation again
given in Section 5.1 in which Shakila
put ` 100 into her daughter’s money
box when she was one year old,
` 150 on her second birthday,
` 200 on her third birthday and will
continue in the same way. How much
money will be collected in the money
box by the time her daughter is 21
years old?
Here, the amount of money (in `) put in the money box on her first, second, third,
fourth . . . birthday were respectively 100, 150, 200, 250, . . . till her 21st birthday. To
find the total amount in the money box on her 21st birthday, we will have to write each
of the 21 numbers in the list above and then add them up. Don’t you think it would be
a tedious and time consuming process? Can we make the process shorter? This would
be possible if we can find a method for getting this sum. Let us see.
We consider the problem given to Gauss (about whom you read in
Chapter 1), to solve when he was just 10 years old. He was asked to find the sum of
the positive integers from 1 to 100. He immediately replied that the sum is 5050. Can
you guess how did he do? He wrote :
S = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 99 + 100
And then, reversed the numbers to write
S = 100 + 99 + . . . + 3 + 2 + 1
Adding these two, he got
2S = (100 + 1) + (99 + 2) + . . . + (3 + 98) + (2 + 99) + (1 + 100)
= 101 + 101 + . . . + 101 + 101 (100 times)
So,

S=

100  101

We will now use the same technique to find the sum of the first n terms of an AP :
a, a + d, a + 2d, . . .
The nth term of this AP is a + (n – 1) d. Let S denote the sum of the first n terms
of the AP. We have
S = a + (a + d ) + (a + 2d ) + . . . + [a + (n – 1) d ]

(1)

Rewriting the terms in reverse order, we have
S = [a + (n – 1) d ] + [a + (n – 2) d ] + . . . + (a + d ) + a

(2)

On adding (1) and (2), term-wise. we get

[2a  (n  1)d ]  [2a  (n  1)d ]  ...  [2a  ( n  1)d ]  [2a  (n  1)d ]

or,

So, the sum of the first n terms of an AP is given by
S=

[2a + (n – 1) d ]
2

We can also write this as

S=

n
[a + a + (n – 1) d ]

i.e.,

S=

(a + an )

Now, if there are only n terms in an AP, then an = l, the last term.
From (3), we see that

This form of the result is useful when the first and the last terms of an AP are
given and the common difference is not given.
Now we return to the question that was posed to us in the beginning. The amount
of money (in Rs) in the money box of Shakila’s daughter on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th birthday,
. . ., were 100, 150, 200, 250, . . ., respectively.
This is an AP. We have to find the total money collected on her 21st birthday, i.e.,
the sum of the first 21 terms of this AP.

Here, a = 100, d = 50 and n = 21. Using the formula :

So, the amount of money collected on her 21st birthday is ` 12600.
Hasn’t the use of the formula made it much easier to solve the problem?
We also use Sn in place of S to denote the sum of first n terms of the AP. We
write S20 to denote the sum of the first 20 terms of an AP. The formula for the sum of
the first n terms involves four quantities S, a, d and n. If we know any three of them,
we can find the fourth.
Remark : The nth term of an AP is the difference of the sum to first n terms and the
sum to first (n – 1) terms of it, i.e., an = Sn – Sn – 1.
Let us consider some examples.
Example 11 : Find the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP : 8, 3, –2, . . .
Solution : Here, a = 8, d = 3 – 8 = –5, n = 22.
We know that

Therefore,

So, the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP is – 979.
Example 12 : If the sum of the first 14 terms of an AP is 1050 and its first term is 10,
find the 20th term.

Example 13 : How many terms of the AP : 24, 21, 18, . . . must be taken so that their

n = 4 or 13

Both values of n are admissible. So, the number of terms is either 4 or 13.
Remarks :
1. In this case, the sum of the first 4 terms = the sum of the first 13 terms = 78.
2. Two answers are possible because the sum of the terms from 5th to 13th will be
zero. This is because a is positive and d is negative, so that some terms will be
positive and some others negative, and will cancel out each other.
Example 14 : Find the sum of :
(i) the first 1000 positive integers

(ii) the first n positive integers

Solution :
(i) Let S = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 1000

Using the formula Sn = (a  l ) for the sum of the first n terms of an AP, we

Example 15 : Find the sum of first 24 terms of the list of numbers whose nth term is

As

an = 3 + 2n,

so,

a1 = 3 + 2 = 5
a2 = 3 + 2 × 2 = 7
a3 = 3 + 2 × 3 = 9

List of numbers becomes 5, 7, 9, 11, . . .

Here,

7 – 5 = 9 – 7 = 11 – 9 = 2 and so on.

So, it forms an AP with common difference d = 2.
To find S24, we have n = 24,
Therefore,

a = 5,

 2  5  (24  1)  2 = 12 10  46 = 672

(ii) the production in the 10th year

(iii) the total production in first 7 years
Solution : (i) Since the production increases uniformly by a fixed number every year,
the number of TV sets manufactured in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., years will form an AP.
Let us denote the number of TV sets manufactured in the nth year by an.

or,

a + 2d = 600

and

a + 6d = 700

and

a = 550.

Therefore, production of TV sets in the first year is 550.
a10 = a + 9d = 550 + 9 × 25 = 775

(ii) Now

So, production of TV sets in the 10th year is 775.

5.5 Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points :
1. An arithmetic progression (AP) is a list of numbers in which each term is obtained by
adding a fixed number d to the preceding term, except the first term. The fixed number d
is called the common difference.
The general form of an AP is a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, . . .
2. A given list of numbers a1, a2, a3, . . . is an AP, if the differences a2 – a1, a3 – a2,
a4 – a3, . . ., give the same value, i.e., if ak + 1 – ak is the same for different values of k.
3. In an AP with first term a and common difference d, the nth term (or the general term) is
given by an = a + (n – 1) d.
4. The sum of the first n terms of an AP is given by :

S=

n
 2a  (n  1) d 

5. If l is the last term of the finite AP, say the nth term, then the sum of all terms of the AP
is given by :
S=

n
(a  l )

6.1 Introduction
You are familiar with triangles and many of their properties from your earlier classes.
In Class IX, you have studied congruence of triangles in detail. Recall that two figures
are said to be congruent, if they have the same shape and the same size. In this
chapter, we shall study about those figures which have the same shape but not necessarily
the same size. Two figures having the same shape (and not necessarily the same size)
are called similar figures. In particular, we shall discuss the similarity of triangles and
apply this knowledge in giving a simple proof of Pythagoras Theorem learnt earlier.
Can you guess how heights of mountains (say Mount Everest) or distances of
some long distant objects (say moon) have been found out? Do you think these have

Reprint 2025-26

74

MATHEMATICS

been measured directly with the help of a measuring tape? In fact, all these heights
and distances have been found out using the idea of indirect measurements, which is
based on the principle of similarity of figures (see Example 7, Q.15 of Exercise 6.3
and also Chapters 8 and 9 of this book).

6.2 Similar Figures
In Class IX, you have seen that all circles with the same radii are congruent, all
squares with the same side lengths are congruent and all equilateral triangles with the
same side lengths are congruent.
Now consider any two (or more)
circles [see Fig. 6.1 (i)]. Are they
congruent? Since all of them do not
have the same radius, they are not
congruent to each other. Note that
some are congruent and some are not,
but all of them have the same shape.
So they all are, what we call, similar.
Two similar figures have the same
shape but not necessarily the same
size. Therefore, all circles are similar.
What about two (or more) squares or
two (or more) equilateral triangles
[see Fig. 6.1 (ii) and (iii)]? As observed
in the case of circles, here also all
squares are similar and all equilateral
triangles are similar.
From the above, we can say
that all congruent figures are
similar but the similar figures need
not be congruent.

Fig. 6.1

Can a circle and a square be
similar? Can a triangle and a square
be similar? These questions can be
answered by just looking at the
figures (see Fig. 6.1). Evidently
these figures are not similar. (Why?)
Fig. 6.2

TRIANGLES

75

What can you say about the two quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS
(see Fig 6.2)?Are they similar? These figures appear to be similar but we cannot be
certain about it.Therefore, we must have some definition of similarity of figures and
based on this definition some rules to decide whether the two given figures are similar
or not. For this, let us look at the photographs given in Fig. 6.3:

Fig. 6.3
You will at once say that they are the photographs of the same monument
(Taj Mahal) but are in different sizes. Would you say that the three photographs are
similar? Yes,they are.
What can you say about the two photographs of the same size of the same
person one at the age of 10 years and the other at the age of 40 years? Are these
photographs similar? These photographs are of the same size but certainly they are
not of the same shape. So, they are not similar.
What does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes
from the same negative? You must have heard about the stamp size, passport size and
postcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, say
of 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or 55mm). Thus, if we
consider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line
45  55 
segment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be
 or  of that of the line segment.
35  35 
This really means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged
(increased) in the ratio 35:45 (or 35:55). It can also be said that every line segment
of the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further,
if you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segments
in the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles)
are always equal. This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular
of two polygons. We say that:
Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their
corresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the
same ratio (or proportion).

Reprint 2025-26

76

MATHEMATICS

Note that the same ratio of the corresponding sides is referred to as the scale
factor (or the Representative Fraction) for the polygons. You must have heard that
world maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are
prepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions.
In order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following
activity:
Activity 1 : Place a lighted bulb at a
point O on the ceiling and directly below
it a table in your classroom. Let us cut a
polygon, say a quadrilateral ABCD, from
a plane cardboard and place this
cardboard parallel to the ground between
the lighted bulb and the table. Then a
shadow of ABCD is cast on the table.
Mark the outline of this shadow as
ABCD (see Fig.6.4).
Note that the quadrilateral ABCD is
an enlargement (or magnification) of the
quadrilateral ABCD. This is because of
the property of light that light propogates
in a straight line. You may also note that
Fig. 6.4
A lies on ray OA, B lies on ray OB, C
lies on OC and D lies on OD. Thus, quadrilaterals ABCD and ABCD are of the
same shape but of different sizes.
So, quadrilateral ABCD is similiar to quadrilateral ABCD. We can also say
that quadrilateral ABCD is similar to the quadrilateral ABCD.
Here, you can also note that vertex A corresponds to vertex A, vertex B
corresponds to vertex B, vertex C corresponds to vertex C and vertex D corresponds
to vertex D. Symbolically, these correspondences are represented as A A, B B,
C C and D  D. By actually measuring the angles and the sides of the two
quadrilaterals, you may verify that
(i)  A =  A,  B =  B,  C =  C,  D =  D and

AB
BC
CD
DA .



A B B C C D D A
This again emphasises that two polygons of the same number of sides are
similar, if (i) all the corresponding angles are equal and (ii) all the corresponding
sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).
(ii)

Reprint 2025-26

77

From the above, you can easily say that quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS of
Fig. 6.5 are similar.

Fig. 6.5
Remark : You can verify that if one polygon is similar to another polygon and this
second polygon is similar to a third polygon, then the first polygon is similar to the third
polygon.
You may note that in the two quadrilaterals (a square and a rectangle) of
Fig. 6.6, corresponding angles are equal, but their corresponding sides are not in the
same ratio.

Fig. 6.6
So, the two quadrilaterals are not similar. Similarly, you may note that in the two
quadrilaterals (a square and a rhombus) of Fig. 6.7, corresponding sides are in the
same ratio, but their corresponding angles are not equal. Again, the two polygons
(quadrilaterals) are not similar.

6.3 Similarity of Triangles
What can you say about the similarity of two triangles?
You may recall that triangle is also a polygon. So, we can state the same conditions
for the similarity of two triangles. That is:
Two triangles are similiar, if
(i) their corresponding angles are equal and
(ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).
Note that if corresponding angles of two
triangles are equal, then they are known as
equiangular triangles. A famous Greek
mathematician Thales gave an important truth relating
to two equiangular triangles which is as follows:
The ratio of any two corresponding sides in
two equiangular triangles is always the same.
It is believed that he had used a result called
the Basic Proportionality Theorem (now known as
the Thales Theorem) for the same.
To understand the Basic Proportionality
Theorem, let us perform the following activity:

arm AX, mark points (say five points) P, Q, D, R and
B such that AP = PQ = QD = DR = RB.
Now, through B, draw any line intersecting arm

Is the converse of this theorem also true (For the meaning of converse, see
Appendix 1)? To examine this, let us perform the following activity:
Activity 3 : Draw an angle XAY on your
notebook and on ray AX, mark points B1, B2,
B3, B4 and B such that AB1 = B1B2 = B2B3 =
B3B4 = B4B.
Similarly, on ray AY, mark points
C1, C2, C3, C4 and C such that AC1 = C1C2 =
C2C3 = C3C4 = C4C. Then join B1C1 and BC
(see Fig. 6.11).

Note that

You can also see that lines B1C1 and BC are parallel to each other, i.e.,

(4)

From (1), (2), (3) and (4), it can be observed that if a line divides two sides of a
triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the third side.
You can repeat this activity by drawing any angle XAY of different measure and
taking any number of equal parts on arms AX and AY . Each time, you will arrive at
the same result. Thus, we obtain the following theorem, which is the converse of
Theorem 6.1:

Here, you can see that A corresponds to D, B corresponds to E and C
corresponds to F. Symbolically, we write the similarity of these two triangles as
‘ ABC ~  DEF’ and read it as ‘triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF’. The
symbol ‘~’ stands for ‘is similar to’. Recall that you have used the symbol ‘’ for
‘is congruent to’ in Class IX.
It must be noted that as done in the case of congruency of two triangles, the
similarity of two triangles should also be expressed symbolically, using correct
correspondence of their vertices. For example, for the triangles ABC and DEF of
Fig. 6.22, we cannot write  ABC ~  EDF or  ABC ~  FED. However, we
can write  BAC ~  EDF.
Now a natural question arises : For checking the similarity of two triangles, say
ABC and DEF, should we always look for all the equality relations of their corresponding
angles ( A =  D,  B =  E,  C =  F) and all the equality relations of the ratios

in Class IX, you have obtained some criteria for congruency of two triangles involving
only three pairs of corresponding parts (or elements) of the two triangles. Here also,
let us make an attempt to arrive at certain criteria for similarity of two triangles involving
relationship between less number of pairs of corresponding parts of the two triangles,
instead of all the six pairs of corresponding parts. For this, let us perform the following
activity:
Activity 4 : Draw two line segments BC and EF of two different lengths, say 3 cm
and 5 cm respectively. Then, at the points B and C respectively, construct angles PBC
and QCB of some measures, say, 60° and 40°. Also, at the points E and F, construct
angles REF and SFE of 60° and 40° respectively (see Fig. 6.23).

constructing several pairs of triangles having their corresponding angles equal. Every
time, you will find that their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).
This activity leads us to the following criterion for similarity of two triangles.
Theorem 6.3 : If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their
corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion) and hence the two
triangles are similar.
This criterion is referred to as the AAA
(Angle–Angle–Angle) criterion of
similarity of two triangles.
This theorem can be proved by taking two
triangles ABC and DEF such that
 A =  D,  B =  E and  C =  F
(see Fig. 6.24)

If two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another
triangle, then the two triangles are similar.
This may be referred to as the AA similarity criterion for two triangles.
You have seen above that if the three angles of one triangle are respectively
equal to the three angles of another triangle, then their corresponding sides are
proportional (i.e., in the same ratio). What about the converse of this statement? Is the
converse true? In other words, if the sides of a triangle are respectively proportional to
the sides of another triangle, is it true that their corresponding angles are equal? Let us
examine it through an activity :
Activity 5 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 3 cm, BC = 6 cm,
CA = 8 cm, DE = 4.5 cm, EF = 9 cm and FD = 12 cm (see Fig. 6.25).

triangles are equal.
So, you have :

You can repeat this activity by drawing several such triangles (having their sides
in the same ratio). Everytime you shall see that their corresponding angles are equal.
It is due to the following criterion of similarity of two triangles:
Theorem 6.4 : If in two triangles, sides of one triangle are proportional to
(i.e., in the same ratio of ) the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding
angles are equal and hence the two triangles are similiar.
This criterion is referred to as the SSS (Side–Side–Side) similarity criterion for
two triangles.

Remark : You may recall that either of the two conditions namely, (i) corresponding
angles are equal and (ii) corresponding sides are in the same ratio is not sufficient for
two polygons to be similar. However, on the basis of Theorems 6.3 and 6.4, you can
now say that in case of similarity of the two triangles, it is not necessary to check both
the conditions as one condition implies the other.
Let us now recall the various criteria for congruency of two triangles learnt in
Class IX. You may observe that SSS similarity criterion can be compared with the SSS
congruency criterion.This suggests us to look for a similarity criterion comparable to
SAS congruency criterion of triangles. For this, let us perform an activity.
Activity 6 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 2 cm,  A = 50°,
AC = 4 cm, DE = 3 cm,  D = 50° and DF = 6 cm (see Fig.6.27).

is, one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and sides including
these angles are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion). Now let us measure  B,  C,
 E and  F.
Here, you may observe that

You will find that  B =  E and  C =  F. That is,  A =  D,  B =  E and
 C =  F. So, by AAA similarity criterion,  ABC ~  DEF. You may repeat this
activity by drawing several pairs of such triangles with one angle of a triangle equal to
one angle of another triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional.
Everytime, you will find that the triangles are similar. It is due to the following criterion
of similarity of triangles:
Theorem 6.5 : If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of the other
triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional, then the two
triangles are similar.
This criterion is referred to as

In this chapter you have studied the following points :
1. Two figures having the same shape but not necessarily the same size are called similar

2. All the congruent figures are similar but the converse is not true.
3. Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their corresponding angles
are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion).
4. If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the other two sides in
distinct points, then the other two sides are divided in the same ratio.
5. If a line divides any two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the
third side.
6. If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their corresponding sides are in
the same ratio and hence the two triangles are similar (AAA similarity criterion).
7. If in two triangles, two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to the two angles of
the other triangle, then the two triangles are similar (AA similarity criterion).

9. If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and the sides including

If in two right triangles, hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are
proportional to the hypotenuse and one side of the other triangle,
then the two triangles are similar. This may be referred to as the

COORDINATE GEOMETRY

7.1 Introduction
In Class IX, you have studied that to locate the position of a point on a plane, we
require a pair of coordinate axes. The distance of a point from the y-axis is called its
x-coordinate, or abscissa. The distance of a point from the x-axis is called its
y-coordinate, or ordinate. The coordinates of a point on the x-axis are of the form
(x, 0), and of a point on the y-axis are of the form (0, y).
Here is a play for you. Draw a set of a pair of perpendicular axes on a graph
paper. Now plot the following points and join them as directed: Join the point A(4, 8) to
B(3, 9) to C(3, 8) to D(1, 6) to E(1, 5) to F(3, 3) to G(6, 3) to H(8, 5) to I(8, 6) to
J(6, 8) to K(6, 9) to L(5, 8) to A. Then join the points P(3.5, 7), Q (3, 6) and R(4, 6) to
form a triangle. Also join the points X(5.5, 7), Y(5, 6) and Z(6, 6) to form a triangle.
Now join S(4, 5), T(4.5, 4) and U(5, 5) to form a triangle. Lastly join S to the points
(0, 5) and (0, 6) and join U to the points (9, 5) and (9, 6). What picture have you got?
Also, you have seen that a linear equation in two variables of the form
ax + by + c = 0, (a, b are not simultaneously zero), when represented graphically,
gives a straight line. Further, in Chapter 2, you have seen the graph of
y = ax2 + bx + c (a ¹ 0), is a parabola. In fact, coordinate geometry has been developed
as an algebraic tool for studying geometry of figures. It helps us to study geometry
using algebra, and understand algebra with the help of geometry. Because of this,
coordinate geometry is widely applied in various fields such as physics, engineering,
navigation, seismology and art!
In this chapter, you will learn how to find the distance between the two points
whose coordinates are given. You will also study how to find the coordinates of the
point which divides a line segment joining two given points in a given ratio.

7.2 Distance Formula
Let us consider the following situation:
A town B is located 36 km east and 15
km north of the town A. How would you find
the distance from town A to town B without
actually measuring it. Let us see. This situation
can be represented graphically as shown in
Fig. 7.1. You may use the Pythagoras Theorem
to calculate this distance.
Now, suppose two points lie on the x-axis.
Can we find the distance between them? For
instance, consider two points A(4, 0) and B(6, 0)
in Fig. 7.2. The points A and B lie on the x-axis.

Fig. 7.1

From the figure you can see that OA = 4
units and OB = 6 units.
Therefore, the distance of B from A, i.e.,
AB = OB – OA = 6 – 4 = 2 units.
So, if two points lie on the x-axis, we can
easily find the distance between them.
Now, suppose we take two points lying on
the y-axis. Can you find the distance between
them. If the points C(0, 3) and D(0, 8) lie on the
y-axis, similarly we find that CD = 8 – 3 = 5 units
(see Fig. 7.2).

Fig. 7.2

Next, can you find the distance of A from C (in Fig. 7.2)? Since OA = 4 units and
OC = 3 units, the distance of A from C, i.e., AC = 32  42 = 5 units. Similarly, you can
find the distance of B from D = BD = 10 units.
Now, if we consider two points not lying on coordinate axis, can we find the
distance between them? Yes! We shall use Pythagoras theorem to do so. Let us see
an example.
In Fig. 7.3, the points P(4, 6) and Q(6, 8) lie in the first quadrant. How do we use
Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between them? Let us draw PR and QS
perpendicular to the x-axis from P and Q respectively. Also, draw a perpendicular
from P on QS to meet QS at T. Then the coordinates of R and S are (4, 0) and (6, 0),
respectively. So, RS = 2 units. Also, QS = 8 units and TS = PR = 6 units.

Reprint 2025-26

COORDINATE GEOMETRY

101

Therefore, QT = 2 units and PT = RS = 2 units.
Now, using the Pythagoras theorem, we
have
PQ2 = PT2 + QT2
= 22 + 2 2 = 8
So,

PQ = 2 2 units

How will we find the distance between two
points in two different quadrants?
Consider the points P(6, 4) and Q(–5, –3)
(see Fig. 7.4). Draw QS perpendicular to the
x-axis. Also draw a perpendicular PT from the
point P on QS (extended) to meet y-axis at the
point R.

Fig. 7.3

Fig. 7.4
Then PT = 11 units and QT = 7 units. (Why?)
Using the Pythagoras Theorem to the right triangle PTQ, we get
PQ = 112  7 2 =

170 units.

Reprint 2025-26

102

MATHEMATICS

Let us now find the distance between any two
points P(x 1, y 1) and Q(x 2, y 2 ). Draw PR and QS
perpendicular to the x-axis. A perpendicular from the
point P on QS is drawn to meet it at the point
T (see Fig. 7.5).
Then,

OR = x1, OS = x2.

So, RS = x2 – x1 = PT.

Also,

SQ = y2, ST = PR = y1. So, QT = y2 – y1.

Now, applying the Pythagoras theorem in  PTQ, we get
PQ2 = PT2 + QT2
= (x2 – x1)2 + (y2 – y1)2
Therefore,

PQ =

Fig. 7.5

 x2  x1 2   y2  y1  2

Note that since distance is always non-negative, we take only the positive square
root. So, the distance between the points P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2) is
PQ =

 x2 – x1  2 +  y2 – y1 2 ,

which is called the distance formula.
Remarks :
1. In particular, the distance of a point P(x, y) from the origin O(0, 0) is given by
OP =
2. We can also write, PQ =

x2  y 2 .

 x1  x2 2   y1  y2 2 . (Why?)

Example 1 : Do the points (3, 2), (–2, –3) and (2, 3) form a triangle? If so, name the
type of triangle formed.
Solution : Let us apply the distance formula to find the distances PQ, QR and PR,
where P(3, 2), Q(–2, –3) and R(2, 3) are the given points. We have
PQ =

(3  2)2  (2  3) 2  52  52  50 = 7.07 (approx.)

QR =

(–2 – 2)2  (–3 – 3) 2  (– 4)2  (– 6)2  52 = 7.21 (approx.)

PR =

(3 – 2) 2  (2 – 3) 2  12  (1)2  2 = 1.41 (approx.)

Since the sum of any two of these distances is greater than the third distance, therefore,
the points P, Q and R form a triangle.

Also, PQ2 + PR2 = QR2, by the converse of Pythagoras theorem, we have  P = 90°.
Therefore, PQR is a right triangle.
Example 2 : Show that the points (1, 7), (4, 2), (–1, –1) and (– 4, 4) are the vertices
of a square.
Solution : Let A(1, 7), B(4, 2), C(–1, –1) and D(– 4, 4) be the given points. One way
of showing that ABCD is a square is to use the property that all its sides should be
equal and both its digonals should also be equal. Now,
AB = (1 – 4) 2  (7  2)2  9  25  34
BC = (4  1) 2  (2  1) 2  25  9  34
CD = (–1  4)2  (–1 – 4) 2  9  25  34
DA = (1  4) 2  (7 – 4) 2 

25  9  34

AC = (1  1) 2  (7  1) 2  4  64  68
BD = (4  4) 2  (2  4) 2  64  4  68
Since, AB = BC = CD = DA and AC = BD, all the four sides of the quadrilateral
ABCD are equal and its diagonals AC and BD are also equal. Thereore, ABCD is a
square.
Alternative Solution : We find
the four sides and one diagonal, say,
AC as above. Here AD2 + DC2 =
34 + 34 = 68 = AC2. Therefore, by
the converse of Pythagoras
theorem,  D = 90°. A quadrilateral
with all four sides equal and one
angle 90° is a square. So, ABCD
is a square.

Solution : Using the distance formula, we have
AB =

(6  3) 2  (4  1) 2  9  9  18  3 2

BC =

(8 – 6) 2  (6 – 4) 2  4  4  8  2 2

AC =

(8 – 3) 2  (6 – 1)2  25  25  50  5 2

Since, AB + BC = 3 2  2 2  5 2  AC, we can say that the points A, B and C
are collinear. Therefore, they are seated in a line.
Example 4 : Find a relation between x and y such that the point (x , y) is equidistant
from the points (7, 1) and (3, 5).
Solution : Let P(x, y) be equidistant from the points A(7, 1) and B(3, 5).
We are given that AP = BP. So, AP2 = BP2
i.e.,

(x – 7)2 + (y – 1)2 = (x – 3)2 + (y – 5)2

i.e.,

x2 – 14x + 49 + y2 – 2y + 1 = x2 – 6x + 9 + y2 – 10y + 25

i.e.,

x–y= 2

which is the required relation.
Remark : Note that the graph of the equation
x – y = 2 is a line. From your earlier studies,
you know that a point which is equidistant
from A and B lies on the perpendicular
bisector of AB. Therefore, the graph of
x – y = 2 is the perpendicular bisector of AB
(see Fig. 7.7).
Example 5 : Find a point on the y-axis which
is equidistant from the points A(6, 5) and
B(– 4, 3).
Solution : We know that a point on the
y-axis is of the form (0, y). So, let the point
Fig. 7.7
P(0, y) be equidistant from A and B. Then
(6 – 0)2 + (5 – y)2 = (– 4 – 0)2 + (3 – y)2
i.e.,
36 + 25 + y2 – 10y = 16 + 9 + y2 – 6y
i.e.,
4y = 36
i.e.,
y= 9

So, the required point is (0, 9).
Let us check our solution : AP =

(6 – 0) 2  (5 – 9) 2  36  16  52

BP =

(– 4 – 0) 2  (3 – 9) 2  16  36  52

Note : Using the remark above, we see that (0, 9) is the intersection of the y-axis and
the perpendicular bisector of AB.

7.3 Section Formula
Let us recall the situation in Section 7.2.
Suppose a telephone company wants to
position a relay tower at P between A and B
is such a way that the distance of the tower
from B is twice its distance from A. If P lies
on AB, it will divide AB in the ratio 1 : 2
(see Fig. 7.9). If we take A as the origin O,
and 1 km as one unit on both the axis, the
coordinates of B will be (36, 15). In order to
know the position of the tower, we must know
the coordinates of P. How do we find these
coordinates?

Fig. 7.9

Let the coordinates of P be (x, y). Draw perpendiculars from P and B to the
x-axis, meeting it in D and E, respectively. Draw PC perpendicular to BE. Then, by
the AA similarity criterion, studied in Chapter 6,  POD and  BPC are similar.

Therefore ,

You can check that P(12, 5) meets the
condition that OP : PB = 1 : 2.
Now let us use the understanding that
you may have developed through this
example to obtain the general formula.
Consider any two points A(x1, y1) and
B(x2, y2) and assume that P (x, y) divides
AB internally in the ratio m 1 : m 2, i.e.,

So, the point (– 4, 6) divides the line segment joining the points A(– 6, 10) and
B(3, – 8) in the ratio 2 : 7.
Note : You can also find this ratio by calculating the distances PA and PB and taking
their ratios provided you know that A, P and B are collinear.

Solution : Let P and Q be the points of

There is perhaps nothing which so occupies the
middle position of mathematics as trigonometry.
– J.F. Herbart (1890)

8.1 Introduction
You have already studied about triangles, and in particular, right triangles, in your
earlier classes. Let us take some examples from our surroundings where right triangles
can be imagined to be formed. For instance :
1. Suppose the students of a school are
visiting Qutub Minar. Now, if a student
is looking at the top of the Minar, a right
triangle can be imagined to be made,
as shown in Fig 8.1. Can the student
find out the height of the Minar, without
actually measuring it?
2. Suppose a girl is sitting on the balcony
of her house located on the bank of a
river. She is looking down at a flower
pot placed on a stair of a temple situated
nearby on the other bank of the river.
A right triangle is imagined to be made
in this situation as shown in Fig.8.2. If
you know the height at which the
person is sitting, can you find the width
of the river?

3. Suppose a hot air balloon is flying in
the air. A girl happens to spot the
balloon in the sky and runs to her
mother to tell her about it. Her mother
rushes out of the house to look at the
balloon.Now when the girl had spotted
the balloon intially it was at point A.
When both the mother and daughter
came out to see it, it had already
travelled to another point B. Can you
find the altitude of B from the ground?

Fig. 8.3

In all the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using
some mathematical techniques, which come under a branch of mathematics called
‘trigonometry’. The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words ‘tri’
(meaning three), ‘gon’ (meaning sides) and ‘metron’ (meaning measure). In fact,
trigonometry is the study of relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle.
The earliest known work on trigonometry was recorded in Egypt and Babylon. Early
astronomers used it to find out the distances of the stars and planets from the Earth.
Even today, most of the technologically advanced methods used in Engineering and
Physical Sciences are based on trigonometrical concepts.
In this chapter, we will study some ratios of the sides of a right triangle with
respect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angle. We will restrict
our discussion to acute angles only. However, these ratios can be extended to other
angles also. We will also define the trigonometric ratios for angles of measure 0° and
90°. We will calculate trigonometric ratios for some specific angles and establish
some identities involving these ratios, called trigonometric identities.

8.2 Trigonometric Ratios
In Section 8.1, you have seen some right triangles
imagined to be formed in different situations.
Let us take a right triangle ABC as shown
in Fig. 8.4.
Here,  CAB (or, in brief, angle A) is an
acute angle. Note the position of the side BC
with respect to angle A. It faces  A. We call it
the side opposite to angle A. AC is the
hypotenuse of the right triangle and the side AB
is a part of  A. So, we call it the side
adjacent to angle A.

Note that the position of sides change
when you consider angle C in place of A
(see Fig. 8.5).
You have studied the concept of ‘ratio’ in
your earlier classes. We now define certain ratios
involving the sides of a right triangle, and call
them trigonometric ratios.
The trigonometric ratios of the angle A
in right triangle ABC (see Fig. 8.4) are defined
as follows :
sine of  A =

side opposite to angle A BC

hypotenuse
AC

cosine of  A =

The ratios defined above are abbreviated as sin A, cos A, tan A, cosec A, sec A
and cot A respectively. Note that the ratios cosec A, sec A and cot A are respectively,
the reciprocals of the ratios sin A, cos A and tan A.

So, the trigonometric ratios of an acute angle in a right triangle express the
relationship between the angle and the length of its sides.
Why don’t you try to define the trigonometric ratios for angle C in the right
triangle? (See Fig. 8.5)

MATHEMATICS

The first use of the idea of ‘sine’ in the way we use
it today was in the work Aryabhatiyam by Aryabhata,
in A.D. 500. Aryabhata used the word ardha-jya
for the half-chord, which was shortened to jya or
jiva in due course. When the Aryabhatiyam was
translated into Arabic, the word jiva was retained as
it is. The word jiva was translated into sinus, which
means curve, when the Arabic version was translated
into Latin. Soon the word sinus, also used as sine,
became common in mathematical texts throughout
Europe. An English Professor of astronomy Edmund
Gunter (1581–1626), first used the abbreviated
notation ‘sin’.

Aryabhata
C.E. 476 – 550

The origin of the terms ‘cosine’ and ‘tangent’ was much later. The cosine function
arose from the need to compute the sine of the complementary angle. Aryabhatta
called it kotijya. The name cosinus originated with Edmund Gunter. In 1674, the
English Mathematician Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation ‘cos’.
Remark : Note that the symbol sin A is used as an
abbreviation for ‘the sine of the angle A’. sin A is not
the product of ‘sin’ and A. ‘sin’ separated from A
has no meaning. Similarly, cos A is not the product of
‘cos’ and A. Similar interpretations follow for other
trigonometric ratios also.
Now, if we take a point P on the hypotenuse
AC or a point Q on AC extended, of the right triangle
ABC and draw PM perpendicular to AB and QN
perpendicular to AB extended (see Fig. 8.6), how
will the trigonometric ratios of  A in  PAM differ
from those of  A in  CAB or from those of  A in
 QAN?

Fig. 8.6

To answer this, first look at these triangles. Is  PAM similar to  CAB? From
Chapter 6, recall the AA similarity criterion. Using the criterion, you will see that the
triangles PAM and CAB are similar. Therefore, by the property of similar triangles,
the corresponding sides of the triangles are proportional.

From this, we find
Similarly,

This shows that the trigonometric ratios of angle A in  PAM not differ from
those of angle A in  CAB.
In the same way, you should check that the value of sin A (and also of other
trigonometric ratios) remains the same in  QAN also.
From our observations, it is now clear that the values of the trigonometric
ratios of an angle do not vary with the lengths of the sides of the triangle, if
the angle remains the same.
Note : For the sake of convenience, we may write sin2A, cos2A, etc., in place of
(sin A)2, (cos A)2, etc., respectively. But cosec A = (sin A)–1  sin–1 A (it is called sine
inverse A). sin–1 A has a different meaning, which will be discussed in higher classes.
Similar conventions hold for the other trigonometric ratios as well. Sometimes, the
Greek letter  (theta) is also used to denote an angle.
We have defined six trigonometric ratios of an acute angle. If we know any one
of the ratios, can we obtain the other ratios? Let us see.

lengths of the sides BC and AC of the triangle
ABC are in the ratio 1 : 3 (see Fig. 8.7). So if
BC is equal to k, then AC will be 3k, where

k is any positive number. To determine other
trigonometric ratios for the angle A, we need to find the length of the third side
AB. Do you remember the Pythagoras theorem? Let us use it to determine the
required length AB.
AB2 = AC2 – BC2 = (3k)2 – (k)2 = 8k2 = (2 2 k)2
Therefore,

AB =  2 2 k

So, we get

AB = 2 2 k

Trigonometric Ratios of 45°
In  ABC, right-angled at B, if one angle is 45°, then

Trigonometric Ratios of 0° and 90°
Let us see what happens to the trigonometric ratios of angle
A, if it is made smaller and smaller in the right triangle ABC
(see Fig. 8.16), till it becomes zero. As  A gets smaller and
smaller, the length of the side BC decreases.The point C gets
closer to point B, and finally when  A becomes very close
to 0°, AC becomes almost the same as AB (see Fig. 8.17).

BC
is very close to 0. Also, when  A is very close to 0°, AC is nearly the

same as AB and so the value of cos A =

This helps us to see how we can define the values of sin A and cos A when
A = 0°. We define : sin 0° = 0 and cos 0° = 1.
Using these, we have :

Now, let us see what happens to the trigonometric ratios of  A, when it is made
larger and larger in  ABC till it becomes 90°. As  A gets larger and larger,  C gets
smaller and smaller. Therefore, as in the case above, the length of the side AB goes on
decreasing. The point A gets closer to point B. Finally when  A is very close to 90°,
 C becomes very close to 0° and the side AC almost coincides with side BC
(see Fig. 8.18).
sec 0° =

Fig. 8.18
When  C is very close to 0°,  A is very close to 90°, side AC is nearly the
same as side BC, and so sin A is very close to 1. Also when  A is very close to 90°,
 C is very close to 0°, and the side AB is nearly zero, so cos A is very close to 0.
So, we define :

sin 90° = 1 and cos 90° = 0.

Now, why don’t you find the other trigonometric ratios of 90°?
We shall now give the values of all the trigonometric ratios of 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°
and 90° in Table 8.1, for ready reference.

9.1 Heights and Distances
In the previous chapter, you have studied about trigonometric ratios. In this chapter,
you will be studying about some ways in which trigonometry is used in the life around
you.
Let us consider Fig. 8.1 of prvious chapter, which is redrawn below in Fig. 9.1.

Fig. 9.1
In this figure, the line AC drawn from the eye of the student to the top of the
minar is called the line of sight. The student is looking at the top of the minar. The
angle BAC, so formed by the line of sight with the horizontal, is called the angle of
elevation of the top of the minar from the eye of the student.
Thus, the line of sight is the line drawn from the eye of an observer to the point
in the object viewed by the observer. The angle of elevation of the point viewed is

Reprint 2025-26

134

MATHEMATICS

the angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point being viewed is
above the horizontal level, i.e., the case when we raise our head to look at the object
(see Fig. 9.2).

Fig. 9.2
Now, consider the situation given in Fig. 8.2. The girl sitting on the balcony is
looking down at a flower pot placed on a stair of the temple. In this case, the line of
sight is below the horizontal level. The angle so formed by the line of sight with the
horizontal is called the angle of depression.
Thus, the angle of depression of a point on the object being viewed is the angle
formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point is below the horizontal
level, i.e., the case when we lower our head to look at the point being viewed
(see Fig. 9.3).

Fig. 9.3
Now, you may identify the lines of sight, and the angles so formed in Fig. 8.3.
Are they angles of elevation or angles of depression?
Let us refer to Fig. 9.1 again. If you want to find the height CD of the minar
without actually measuring it, what information do you need? You would need to know
the following:
(i) the distance DE at which the student is standing from the foot of the minar

Reprint 2025-26

SOME APPLICATIONS OF TRIGONOMETRY

135

(ii) the angle of elevation,  BAC, of the top of the minar
(iii) the height AE of the student.
Assuming that the above three conditions are known, how can we determine the
height of the minar?
In the figure, CD = CB + BD. Here, BD = AE, which is the height of the student.
To find BC, we will use trigonometric ratios of  BAC or  A.
In  ABC, the side BC is the opposite side in relation to the known  A. Now,
which of the trigonometric ratios can we use? Which one of them has the two values
that we have and the one we need to determine? Our search narrows down to using
either tan A or cot A, as these ratios involve AB and BC.
Therefore,

tan A =

BC
AB ,
or cot A =
which on solving would give us BC.
AB
BC

By adding AE to BC, you will get the height of the minar.
Now let us explain the process, we have just discussed, by solving some problems.
Example 1 : A tower stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground,
which is 15 m away from the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the
tower is found to be 60°. Find the height of the tower.
Solution : First let us draw a simple diagram to
represent the problem (see Fig. 9.4). Here AB
represents the tower, CB is the distance of the point
from the tower and  ACB is the angle of elevation.
We need to determine the height of the tower, i.e.,
AB. Also, ACB is a triangle, right-angled at B.
To solve the problem, we choose the trigonometric
ratio tan 60° (or cot 60°), as the ratio involves AB
and BC.
Now,

tan 60° =

AB
BC

i.e.,

3 =

AB
15

i.e.,

Fig. 9.4

AB = 15 3

Hence, the height of the tower is 15 3 m.

MATHEMATICS

Example 2 : An electrician has to repair an
electric fault on a pole of height 5 m. She needs
to reach a point 1.3m below the top of the pole
to undertake the repair work (see Fig. 9.5). What
should be the length of the ladder that she should
use which, when inclined at an angle of 60° to
the horizontal, would enable her to reach the
required position? Also, how far from the foot
of the pole should she place the foot of the
ladder? (You may take

3 = 1.73)

Solution : In Fig. 9.5, the electrician is required to
reach the point B on the pole AD.
So,

BD = AD – AB = (5 – 1.3)m = 3.7 m.

Fig. 9.5

Here, BC represents the ladder. We need to find
its length, i.e., the hypotenuse of the right triangle BDC.
Now, can you think which trigonometic ratio should we consider?
It should be sin 60°.
So,

BD
3.7

= sin 60° or

Therefore,

BC =

3.7  2

i.e., the length of the ladder should be 4.28 m.
Now,

DC

i.e.,

DC =

3.7
= 2.14 m (approx.)

Therefore, she should place the foot of the ladder at a distance of 2.14 m from
the pole.

Example 3 : An observer 1.5 m tall is 28.5 m away
from a chimney. The angle of elevation of the top
of the chimney from her eyes is 45°. What is the
height of the chimney?
Solution : Here, AB is the chimney, CD the
observer and  ADE the angle of elevation (see
Fig. 9.6). In this case, ADE is a triangle, right-angled
at E and we are required to find the height of the
chimney.
We have

AB = AE + BE = AE + 1.5

and

DE = CB = 28.5 m

Fig. 9.6

To determine AE, we choose a trigonometric ratio, which involves both AE and
DE. Let us choose the tangent of the angle of elevation.
Now,

tan 45° =

AE
DE

i.e.,

1=

AE
28.5

Therefore,

AE = 28.5

So the height of the chimney (AB) = (28.5 + 1.5) m = 30 m.
Example 4 : From a point P on the ground the angle of elevation of the top of a 10 m
tall building is 30°. A flag is hoisted at the top of the building and the angle of elevation
of the top of the flagstaff from P is 45°. Find the length of the flagstaff and the
distance of the building from the point P. (You may take 3 = 1.732)
Solution : In Fig. 9.7, AB denotes the height of the building, BD the flagstaff and P
the given point. Note that there are two right triangles PAB and PAD. We are required
to find the length of the flagstaff, i.e., DB and the distance of the building from the
point P, i.e., PA.

Therefore,

i.e., the distance of the building from P is 10 3 m = 17.32 m.
Next, let us suppose DB = x m. Then AD = (10 + x) m.

So, the length of the flagstaff is 7.32 m.
Example 5 : The shadow of a tower standing
on a level ground is found to be 40 m longer
when the Sun’s altitude is 30° than when it is
60°. Find the height of the tower.
Solution : In Fig. 9.8, AB is the tower and
BC is the length of the shadow when the
Sun’s altitude is 60°, i.e., the angle of
elevation of the top of the tower from the tip
of the shadow is 60° and DB is the length of
the shadow, when the angle of elevation
is 30°.

Fig. 9.8

Now, let AB be h m and BC be x m. According to the question, DB is 40 m longer
than BC.

Therefore, the height of the tower is 20 3 m.
Example 6 : The angles of depression of the top and the bottom of an 8 m tall building
from the top of a multi-storeyed building are 30°
and 45°, respectively. Find the height of the multistoreyed building and the distance between the
two buildings.
Solution : In Fig. 9.9, PC denotes the multistoryed building and AB denotes the 8 m tall
building. We are interested to determine the height
of the multi-storeyed building, i.e., PC and the
distance between the two buildings, i.e., AC.
Look at the figure carefully. Observe that PB is
a transversal to the parallel lines PQ and BD.
Therefore, QPB and PBD are alternate

AB is the width of the river. P is a

10.1 Introduction
You have studied in Class IX that a circle is a collection of all points in a plane
which are at a constant distance (radius) from a fixed point (centre). You have
also studied various terms related to a circle like chord, segment, sector, arc etc.
Let us now examine the different situations that can arise when a circle and a line
are given in a plane.
So, let us consider a circle and a line PQ. There can be three possibilities given
in Fig. 10.1 below:

Fig. 10.1
In Fig. 10.1 (i), the line PQ and the circle have no common point. In this case,
PQ is called a non-intersecting line with respect to the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (ii), there
are two common points A and B that the line PQ and the circle have. In this case, we
call the line PQ a secant of the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (iii), there is only one point A which
is common to the line PQ and the circle. In this case, the line is called a tangent to the
circle.

You might have seen a pulley fitted over a well which is used
in taking out water from the well. Look at Fig. 10.2. Here the rope
on both sides of the pulley, if considered as a ray, is like a tangent
to the circle representing the pulley.
Is there any position of the line with respect to the circle
other than the types given above? You can see that there cannot
be any other type of position of the line with respect to the circle.
In this chapter, we will study about the existence of the tangents
to a circle and also study some of their properties.

Fig. 10.2

10.2 Tangent to a Circle
In the previous section, you have seen that a tangent* to a circle is a line that
intersects the circle at only one point.
To understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform
the following activities:
Activity 1 : Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the
circular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table
and gently rotate the wire AB about the point P to get different positions of the straight
wire [see Fig. 10.3(i)].
In various positions, the wire intersects the
circular wire at P and at another point Q1 or Q2 or
Q3, etc. In one position, you will see that it will
intersect the circle at the point P only (see position
AB of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at
the point P of the circle. On rotating further, you
can observe that in all other positions of AB, it will
intersect the circle at P and at another point, say R1
or R2 or R3, etc. So, you can observe that there is
only one tangent at a point of the circle.
Fig. 10.3 (i)
While doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB
moves towards the position A B, the common point, say Q1, of the line AB and the
circle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point P. Ultimately, it coincides
with the point P in the position AB of AB. Again note, what happens if ‘AB’ is
rotated rightwards about P? The common point R3 gradually comes nearer and nearer
to P and ultimately coincides with P. So, what we see is:
The tangent to a circle is a special case of the secant, when the two end
points of its corresponding chord coincide.
*The word ‘tangent’ comes from the Latin word ‘tangere’, which means to touch and was
introduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fineke in 1583.

Reprint 2025-26

146

MATHEMATICS

Activity 2 : On a paper, draw a circle and a
secant PQ of the circle. Draw various lines
parallel to the secant on both sides of it. You
will find that after some steps, the length of
the chord cut by the lines will gradually
decrease, i.e., the two points of intersection of
the line and the circle are coming closer and
closer [see Fig. 10.3(ii)]. In one case, it
becomes zero on one side of the secant and in
another case, it becomes zero on the other side
of the secant. See the positions PQ and PQ
of the secant in Fig. 10.3 (ii). These are the
tangents to the circle parallel to the given secant
PQ. This also helps you to see that there cannot
be more than two tangents parallel to a given
secant.

Fig. 10.3 (ii)

This activity also establishes, what you must have observed, while doing
Activity 1, namely, a tangent is the secant when both of the end points of the
corresponding chord coincide.
The common point of the tangent and the circle is called the point of contact
[the point A in Fig. 10.1 (iii)]and the tangent is said to touch the circle at the
common point.
Now look around you. Have you seen a bicycle
or a cart moving? Look at its wheels. All the spokes
of a wheel are along its radii. Now note the position
of the wheel with respect to its movement on the
ground. Do you see any tangent anywhere?
(See Fig. 10.4). In fact, the wheel moves along a line
which is a tangent to the circle representing the wheel.
Also, notice that in all positions, the radius through
the point of contact with the ground appears to be at
right angles to the tangent (see Fig. 10.4). We shall
now prove this property of the tangent.

Theorem 10.1 : The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the
radius through the point of contact.
Proof : We are given a circle with centre O and a tangent XY to the circle at a
point P. We need to prove that OP is perpendicular to XY.

Take a point Q on XY other than P and join OQ (see Fig. 10.5).
The point Q must lie outside the circle.
(Why? Note that if Q lies inside the circle, XY
will become a secant and not a tangent to the
circle). Therefore, OQ is longer than the radius
OP of the circle. That is,
OQ > OP.
Since this happens for every point on the
line XY except the point P, OP is the
shortest of all the distances of the point O to the
points of XY. So OP is perpendicular to XY.
(as shown in Theorem A1.7.)

Fig. 10.5

Remarks
1. By theorem above, we can also conclude that at any point on a circle there can be
one and only one tangent.
2. The line containing the radius through the point of contact is also sometimes called
the ‘normal’ to the circle at the point.

10.3 Number of Tangents from a Point on a Circle
To get an idea of the number of tangents from a point on a circle, let us perform the
following activity:

MATHEMATICS

Activity 3 : Draw a circle on a paper. Take a
point P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the
circle through this point? You will find that all
the lines through this point intersect the circle in
two points. So, it is not possible to draw any
tangent to a circle through a point inside it
[see Fig. 10.6 (i)].
Next take a point P on the circle and draw
tangents through this point. You have already
observed that there is only one tangent to the
circle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)].

(i)

Finally, take a point P outside the circle and
try to draw tangents to the circle from this point.
What do you observe? You will find that you
can draw exactly two tangents to the circle
through this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)].
We can summarise these facts as follows:
Case 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing
through a point lying inside the circle.

(ii)

Case 2 : There is one and only one tangent to a
circle passing through a point lying on the circle.
Case 3 : There are exactly two tangents to a
circle through a point lying outside the circle.
In Fig. 10.6 (iii), T1and T2 are the points of
contact of the tangents PT 1 and PT 2
respectively.
The length of the segment of the tangent
from the external point P and the point of contact
with the circle is called the length of the tangent
from the point P to the circle.

(iii)
Fig. 10.6

Note that in Fig. 10.6 (iii), PT1 and PT2 are the lengths of the tangents from P to
the circle. The lengths PT1 and PT2 have a common property. Can you find this?
Measure PT1 and PT2. Are these equal? In fact, this is always so. Let us give a proof
of this fact in the following theorem.

Theorem 10.2 : The lengths of tangents drawn
from an external point to a circle are equal.
Proof : We are given a circle with centre O, a
point P lying outside the circle and two tangents
PQ, PR on the circle from P (see Fig. 10.7). We
are required to prove that PQ = PR.
For this, we join OP, OQ and OR. Then
∠ OQP and ∠ ORP are right angles, because
these are angles between the radii and tangents,
and according to Theorem 10.1 they are right
angles. Now in right triangles OQP and ORP,
OQ = OR

Fig. 10.7
(Radii of the same circle)

OP = OP

(Common)

Therefore,

∆ OQP ≅ ∆ ORP

(RHS)

This gives

PQ = PR

(CPCT)

Remarks
1. The theorem can also be proved by using the Pythagoras Theorem as follows:
PQ2 = OP2 – OQ2 = OP2 – OR2 = PR2 (As OQ = OR)
which gives PQ = PR.
2. Note also that ∠ OPQ = ∠ OPR. Therefore, OP is the angle bisector of ∠ QPR,
i.e., the centre lies on the bisector of the angle between the two tangents.
Let us take some examples.
Example 1 : Prove that in two concentric circles,
the chord of the larger circle, which touches the
smaller circle, is bisected at the point of contact.
Solution : We are given two concentric circles
C1 and C2 with centre O and a chord AB of the
larger circle C1 which touches the smaller circle
C2 at the point P (see Fig. 10.8). We need to prove
that AP = BP.
Let us join OP. Then, AB is a tangent to C2 at P
and OP is its radius. Therefore, by Theorem 10.1,
OP ⊥ AB

Reprint 2025-26

Now AB is a chord of the circle C1 and OP  AB. Therefore, OP is the bisector of the
chord AB, as the perpendicular from the centre bisects the chord,
i.e.,

AP = BP

Example 2 : Two tangents TP and TQ are drawn
to a circle with centre O from an external point T.
Prove that  PTQ = 2  OPQ.
Solution : We are given a circle with centre O,
an external point T and two tangents TP and TQ

length TP.
Solution : Join OT. Let it intersect PQ at the
point R. Then  TPQ is isosceles and TO is the
angle bisector of  PTQ. So, OT  PQ

AREAS RELATED TO CIRCLES

11.1 Areas of Sector and Segment of a Circle
You have already come across the terms sector and
segment of a circle in your earlier classes. Recall
that the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed
by two radii and the corresponding arc is called a
sector of the circle and the portion (or part) of the
circular region enclosed between a chord and the
corresponding arc is called a segment of the circle.
Thus, in Fig. 11.1, shaded region OAPB is a sector
Fig. 11.1
of the circle with centre O. ∠ AOB is called the
angle of the sector. Note that in this figure, unshaded region OAQB is also a sector of
the circle. For obvious reasons, OAPB is called the minor sector and
OAQB is called the major sector. You can also see that angle of the major sector is
360° – ∠ AOB.
Now, look at Fig. 11.2 in which AB is a chord
of the circle with centre O. So, shaded region APB is
a segment of the circle. You can also note that
unshaded region AQB is another segment of the circle
formed by the chord AB. For obvious reasons, APB
is called the minor segment and AQB is called the
major segment.
Remark : When we write ‘segment’ and ‘sector’
we will mean the ‘minor segment’ and the ‘minor
sector’ respectively, unless stated otherwise.

Now with this knowledge, let us try to find some
relations (or formulae) to calculate their areas.
Let OAPB be a sector of a circle with centre
O and radius r (see Fig. 11.3). Let the degree
measure of Ð AOB be q.
You know that area of a circle (in fact of a
circular region or disc) is pr2.
In a way, we can consider this circular region to
be a sector forming an angle of 360° (i.e., of degree
measure 360) at the centre O. Now by applying the
Unitary Method, we can arrive at the area of the
sector OAPB as follows:

Fig. 11.3

When degree measure of the angle at the centre is 360, area of the
sector = pr 2
So, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is 1, area of the
r 2

360
Therefore, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is q, area of the

sector =


r 2
 r 2 .
 =

360
Thus, we obtain the following relation (or formula) for area of a sector of a
circle:

sector =

Area of the sector of angle q =


 r 2 ,
360

where r is the radius of the circle and q the angle of the sector in degrees.
Now, a natural question arises : Can we find
the length of the arc APB corresponding to this
sector? Yes. Again, by applying the Unitary
Method and taking the whole length of the circle
(of angle 360°) as 2pr, we can obtain the required

 2 r .
length of the arc APB as
360

 2 r .
So, length of an arc of a sector of angle q =
360

MATHEMATICS

Now let us take the case of the area of the
segment APB of a circle with centre O and radius r
(see Fig. 11.4). You can see that :
Area of the segment APB = Area of the sector OAPB – Area of  OAB


 r 2 – area of  OAB

Note : From Fig. 11.3 and Fig. 11.4 respectively, you can observe that:
=

Area of the major sector OAQB = r2 – Area of the minor sector OAPB
and

Area of major segment AQB = r2 – Area of the minor segment APB
Let us now take some examples to understand these concepts (or results).

Example 1 : Find the area of the sector of a circle
with radius 4 cm and of angle 30°. Also, find the area
of the corresponding major sector (Use  = 3.14).

12.1 Introduction
From Class IX, you are familiar with some of the solids like cuboid, cone, cylinder, and
sphere (see Fig. 12.1). You have also learnt how to find their surface areas and volumes.

Fig. 12.1
In our day-to-day life, we come across a number of solids made up of combinations
of two or more of the basic solids as shown above.
You must have seen a truck with a
container fitted on its back (see Fig. 12.2),
carrying oil or water from one place to
another. Is it in the shape of any of the four
basic solids mentioned above? You may
guess that it is made of a cylinder with two
hemispheres as its ends.

MATHEMATICS

Again, you may have seen an object like the
one in Fig. 12.3. Can you name it? A test tube, right!
You would have used one in your science laboratory.
This tube is also a combination of a cylinder and a
hemisphere. Similarly, while travelling, you may have
seen some big and beautiful buildings or monuments
made up of a combination of solids mentioned above.
If for some reason you wanted to find the
surface areas, or volumes, or capacities of such
objects, how would you do it? We cannot classify
these under any of the solids you have already studied.

Fig. 12.3

In this chapter, you will see how to find surface areas and volumes of such
objects.

12.2 Surface Area of a Combination of Solids
Let us consider the container seen in Fig. 12.2. How do we find the surface area of
such a solid? Now, whenever we come across a new problem, we first try to see, if
we can break it down into smaller problems, we have earlier solved. We can see that
this solid is made up of a cylinder with two hemispheres stuck at either end. It would
look like what we have in Fig. 12.4, after we put the pieces all together.

Fig. 12.4
If we consider the surface of the newly formed object, we would be able to see
only the curved surfaces of the two hemispheres and the curved surface of the cylinder.
So, the total surface area of the new solid is the sum of the curved surface
areas of each of the individual parts. This gives,
TSA of new solid = CSA of one hemisphere + CSA of cylinder
+ CSA of other hemisphere
where TSA, CSA stand for ‘Total Surface Area’ and ‘Curved Surface Area’
respectively.
Let us now consider another situation. Suppose we are making a toy by putting
together a hemisphere and a cone. Let us see the steps that we would be going
through.

Reprint 2025-26

SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES

163

First, we would take a cone and a hemisphere and bring their flat faces together.
Here, of course, we would take the base radius of the cone equal to the radius of the
hemisphere, for the toy is to have a smooth surface. So, the steps would be as shown
in Fig. 12.5.

Fig. 12.5
At the end of our trial, we have got ourselves a nice round-bottomed toy. Now if
we want to find how much paint we would require to colour the surface of this toy,
what would we need to know? We would need to know the surface area of the toy,
which consists of the CSA of the hemisphere and the CSA of the cone.
So, we can say:
Total surface area of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone
Now, let us consider some examples.
Example 1 : Rasheed got a playing top (lattu) as his
birthday present, which surprisingly had no colour on
it. He wanted to colour it with his crayons. The top is
shaped like a cone surmounted by a hemisphere
(see Fig 12.6). The entire top is 5 cm in height and
the diameter of the top is 3.5 cm. Find the area he
has to colour. (Take  =

22
)
7

Fig. 12.6

Solution : This top is exactly like the object we have discussed in Fig. 12.5. So, we
can conveniently use the result we have arrived at there. That is :
TSA of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone

diameter of the cylindrical portion is 3 cm. If
the conical portion is to be painted orange

Solution : Denote radius of cone by r, slant

12.3 Volume of a Combination of Solids

Fig. 12.11

In the previous section, we have discussed how to find the surface area of solids made
up of a combination of two basic solids. Here, we shall see how to calculate their
volumes. It may be noted that in calculating the surface area, we have not added the
surface areas of the two constituents, because some part of the surface area disappeared
in the process of joining them. However, this will not be the case when we calculate
the volume. The volume of the solid formed by joining two basic solids will actually be
the sum of the volumes of the constituents, as we see in the examples below.
Example 5 : Shanta runs an industry in
a shed which is in the shape of a cuboid
surmounted by a half cylinder (see Fig.
12.12). If the base of the shed is of
dimension 7 m × 15 m, and the height of
the cuboidal portion is 8 m, find the volume
of air that the shed can hold. Further,
suppose the machinery in the shed
occupies a total space of 300 m3, and
there are 20 workers, each of whom
occupy about 0.08 m 3 space on an

Solution : The volume of air inside the shed (when there are no people or machinery)
is given by the volume of air inside the cuboid and inside the half cylinder, taken
together.
Now, the length, breadth and height of the cuboid are 15 m, 7 m and 8 m, respectively.
Also, the diameter of the half cylinder is 7 m and its height is 15 m.

Next, the total space occupied by the machinery = 300 m3
And the total space occupied by the workers = 20 × 0.08 m3 = 1.6 m3

Example 6 : A juice seller was serving his
customers using glasses as shown in Fig. 12.13.
The inner diameter of the cylindrical glass was

capacity of the glass. If the height of a glass
was 10 cm, find the apparent capacity of the
glass and its actual capacity. (Use  = 3.14.)

Fig. 12.13

Solution : Since the inner diameter of the glass = 5 cm and height = 10 cm,
the apparent capacity of the glass = r 2 h
= 3.14 × 2.5 × 2.5 × 10 cm3 = 196.25 cm3
But the actual capacity of the glass is less by the volume of the hemisphere at the

Hence, the required difference of the two volumes = 25.12 cm3.

13.1 Introduction
In Class IX, you have studied the classification of given data into ungrouped as well as
grouped frequency distributions. You have also learnt to represent the data pictorially
in the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varying
widths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certain
numerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of central
tendency, namely, mean, median and mode. In this chapter, we shall extend the study
of these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that of
grouped data. We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the
cumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, called
ogives.

13.2 Mean of Grouped Data
The mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all the
observations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that if
x1, x2,. . ., xn are observations with respective frequencies f1, f2, . . ., fn, then this
means observation x1 occurs f1 times, x2 occurs f2 times, and so on.
Now, the sum of the values of all the observations = f1x1 + f2x2 + . . . + fnxn, and
the number of observations = f1 + f2 + . . . + fn.
So, the mean x of the data is given by
f x  f 2 x2    f n xn
x = 1 1
f1  f 2    f n
Recall that we can write this in short form by using the Greek letter  (capital
sigma) which means summation. That is,

which, more briefly, is written as x =

1 to n.
Let us apply this formula to find the mean in the following example.
Example 1 : The marks obtained by 30 students of Class X of a certain school in a
Mathematics paper consisting of 100 marks are presented in table below. Find the
mean of the marks obtained by the students.

Solution: Recall that to find the mean marks, we require the product of each xi with
the corresponding frequency fi. So, let us put them in a column as shown in Table 13.1.

Therefore, the mean marks obtained is 59.3.
In most of our real life situations, data is usually so large that to make a meaningful
study it needs to be condensed as grouped data. So, we need to convert given ungrouped
data into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean.
Let us convert the ungrouped data of Example 1 into grouped data by forming
class-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each
class-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next
class, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the classinterval 40-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped
frequency distribution table (see Table 13.2).

Now, for each class-interval, we require a point which would serve as the
representative of the whole class. It is assumed that the frequency of each classinterval is centred around its mid-point. So the mid-point (or class mark) of each
class can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class. Recall that we
find the mid-point of a class (or its class mark) by finding the average of its upper and
lower limits. That is,
Class mark =

Upper class limit + Lower class limit

10 + 25
, i.e.,

17.5. Similarly, we can find the class marks of the remaining class intervals. We put
them in Table 13.3. These class marks serve as our xi’s. Now, in general, for the ith
class interval, we have the frequency fi corresponding to the class mark xi. We can
now proceed to compute the mean in the same manner as in Example 1.
With reference to Table 13.2, for the class 10-25, the class mark is

This new method of finding the mean is known as the Direct Method.
We observe that Tables 13.1 and 13.3 are using the same data and employing the
same formula for the calculation of the mean but the results obtained are different.
Can you think why this is so, and which one is more accurate? The difference in the
two values is because of the mid-point assumption in Table 13.3, 59.3 being the exact
mean, while 62 an approximate mean.
Sometimes when the numerical values of xi and fi are large, finding the product
of xi and fi becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of
a method of reducing these calculations.
We can do nothing with the fi’s, but we can change each xi to a smaller number
so that our calculations become easy. How do we do this? What about subtracting a
fixed number from each of these xi’s? Let us try this method.
The first step is to choose one among the xi’s as the assumed mean, and denote
it by ‘a’. Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take ‘a’ to be that xi
which lies in the centre of x1, x2, . . ., xn. So, we can choose a = 47.5 or a = 62.5. Let
us choose a = 47.5.
The next step is to find the difference di between a and each of the xi’s, that is,
the deviation of ‘a’ from each of the xi’s.
i.e.,

di = xi – a = xi – 47.5

Reprint 2025-26

STATISTICS

175

The third step is to find the product of di with the corresponding fi, and take the sum
of all the fi di’s. The calculations are shown in Table 13.4.

So, from Table 13.4, the mean of the deviations, d =

.
Σfi

Now, let us find the relation between d and x .
Since in obtaining di, we subtracted ‘a’ from each xi, so, in order to get the mean
x , we need to add ‘a’ to d . This can be explained mathematically as:

Mean of deviations,

d =

d =

MATHEMATICS

Substituting the values of a, Σfidi and Σfi from Table 13.4, we get
x = 47.5 +

435
= 47.5 + 14.5 = 62 .
30

Therefore, the mean of the marks obtained by the students is 62.
The method discussed above is called the Assumed Mean Method.
Activity 1 : From the Table 13.3 find the mean by taking each of xi (i.e., 17.5, 32.5,
and so on) as ‘a’. What do you observe? You will find that the mean determined in
each case is the same, i.e., 62. (Why ?)
So, we can say that the value of the mean obtained does not depend on the
choice of ‘a’.
Observe that in Table 13.4, the values in Column 4 are all multiples of 15. So, if
we divide the values in the entire Column 4 by 15, we would get smaller numbers to
multiply with fi. (Here, 15 is the class size of each class interval.)
So, let ui =

xi − a
, where a is the assumed mean and h is the class size.
h

Now, we calculate ui in this way and continue as before (i.e., find fi ui and
then Σ fi ui). Taking h = 15, let us form Table 13.5.

Therefore, the mean percentage of female teachers in the primary schools of
rural areas is 39.71.
Remark : The result obtained by all the three methods is the same. So the choice of
method to be used depends on the numerical values of xi and fi. If xi and fi are
sufficiently small, then the direct method is an appropriate choice. If xi and fi are
numerically large numbers, then we can go for the assumed mean method or
step-deviation method. If the class sizes are unequal, and xi are large numerically, we
can still apply the step-deviation method by taking h to be a suitable divisor of all the di’s.

13.3 Mode of Grouped Data
Recall from Class IX, a mode is that value among the observations which occurs most
often, that is, the value of the observation having the maximum frequency. Further, we
discussed finding the mode of ungrouped data. Here, we shall discuss ways of obtaining
a mode of grouped data. It is possible that more than one value may have the same
maximum frequency. In such situations, the data is said to be multimodal. Though
grouped data can also be multimodal, we shall restrict ourselves to problems having a
single mode only.
Let us first recall how we found the mode for ungrouped data through the following
example.
Example 4 : The wickets taken by a bowler in 10 cricket matches are as follows:

MATHEMATICS

Clearly, 2 is the number of wickets taken by the bowler in the maximum number
(i.e., 3) of matches. So, the mode of this data is 2.
In a grouped frequency distribution, it is not possible to determine the mode by
looking at the frequencies. Here, we can only locate a class with the maximum
frequency, called the modal class. The mode is a value inside the modal class, and is
given by the formula:


f1  f0 
Mode = l  
h
 2 f1  f 0  f 2 
where l = lower limit of the modal class,
h = size of the class interval (assuming all class sizes to be equal),
f1 = frequency of the modal class,
f0 = frequency of the class preceding the modal class,
f2 = frequency of the class succeeding the modal class.
Let us consider the following examples to illustrate the use of this formula.
Example 5 : A survey conducted on 20 households in a locality by a group of students
resulted in the following frequency table for the number of family members in a
household:
Family size

1-3

3-5

5-7

7-9

9 - 11

Number of

8

2

1

Find the mode of this data.
Solution : Here the maximum class frequency is 8, and the class corresponding to this
frequency is 3 – 5. So, the modal class is 3 – 5.
Now
modal class = 3 – 5, lower limit (l ) of modal class = 3, class size (h) = 2
frequency ( f1 ) of the modal class = 8,
frequency ( f0 ) of class preceding the modal class = 7,
frequency ( f2 ) of class succeeding the modal class = 2.
Now, let us substitute these values in the formula :

87
2
= 3
  2  3   3.286
7
28  7  2
Therefore, the mode of the data above is 3.286.
Example 6 : The marks distribution of 30 students in a mathematics examination are
given in Table 13.3 of Example 1. Find the mode of this data. Also compare and
interpret the mode and the mean.
Solution : Refer to Table 13.3 of Example 1. Since the maximum number of students
(i.e., 7) have got marks in the interval 40 - 55, the modal class is 40 - 55. Therefore,
the lower limit ( l ) of the modal class = 40,
the class size ( h) = 15,
the frequency ( f1 ) of modal class = 7,
the frequency ( f0 ) of the class preceding the modal class = 3,
the frequency ( f2 ) of the class succeeding the modal class = 6.
Now, using the formula:


f1  f0 
Mode = l  
  h,
 2 f1  f 0  f 2 
we get

 73 
Mode = 40  
  15 = 52
 14  6  3 

So, the mode marks is 52.
Now, from Example 1, you know that the mean marks is 62.
So, the maximum number of students obtained 52 marks, while on an average a
student obtained 62 marks.
Remarks :
1. In Example 6, the mode is less than the mean. But for some other problems it may
be equal or more than the mean also.
2. It depends upon the demand of the situation whether we are interested in finding the
average marks obtained by the students or the average of the marks obtained by most

of the students. In the first situation, the mean is required and in the second situation,
the mode is required.
Activity 3 : Continuing with the same groups as formed in Activity 2 and the situations
assigned to the groups. Ask each group to find the mode of the data. They should also
compare this with the mean, and interpret the meaning of both.
Remark : The mode can also be calculated for grouped data with unequal class sizes.
However, we shall not be discussing it.

13.4 Median of Grouped Data
As you have studied in Class IX, the median is a measure of central tendency which
gives the value of the middle-most observation in the data. Recall that for finding the

Now, let us see how to obtain the median of grouped data, through the following

How many students have scored less than 20 marks? Observe that the number
of students who have scored less than 20 include the number of students who have
scored marks from 0 - 10 as well as the number of students who have scored marks
from 10 - 20. So, the total number of students with marks less than 20 is 5 + 3, i.e., 8.
We say that the cumulative frequency of the class 10 -20 is 8.
Similarly, we can compute the cumulative frequencies of the other classes, i.e.,
the number of students with marks less than 30, less than 40, . . ., less than 100. We
give them in Table 13.13 given below:

The distribution given above is called the cumulative frequency distribution of
the less than type. Here 10, 20, 30, . . . 100, are the upper limits of the respective
class intervals.
We can similarly make the table for the number of students with scores, more
than or equal to 0, more than or equal to 10, more than or equal to 20, and so on. From
Table 13.12, we observe that all 53 students have scored marks more than or equal to
0. Since there are 5 students scoring marks in the interval 0 - 10, this means that there
are 53 – 5 = 48 students getting more than or equal to 10 marks. Continuing in the
same manner, we get the number of students scoring 20 or above as 48 – 3 = 45, 30 or
above as 45 – 4 = 41, and so on, as shown in Table 13.14.

Find the median height.
Solution : To calculate the median height, we need to find the class intervals and their
corresponding frequencies.
The given distribution being of the less than type, 140, 145, 150, . . ., 165 give the
upper limits of the corresponding class intervals. So, the classes should be below 140,
140 - 145, 145 - 150, . . ., 160 - 165. Observe that from the given distribution, we find
that there are 4 girls with height less than 140, i.e., the frequency of class interval
below 140 is 4. Now, there are 11 girls with heights less than 145 and 4 girls with
height less than 140. Therefore, the number of girls with height in the interval
140 - 145 is 11 – 4 = 7. Similarly, the frequency of 145 - 150 is 29 – 11 = 18, for
150 - 155, it is 40 – 29 = 11, and so on. So, our frequency distribution table with the

Now, that you have studied about all the three measures of central tendency, let
us discuss which measure would be best suited for a particular requirement.
The mean is the most frequently used measure of central tendency because it
takes into account all the observations, and lies between the extremes, i.e., the largest
and the smallest observations of the entire data. It also enables us to compare two or
more distributions. For example, by comparing the average (mean) results of students
of different schools of a particular examination, we can conclude which school has a
better performance.
However, extreme values in the data affect the mean. For example, the mean of
classes having frequencies more or less the same is a good representative of the data.
But, if one class has frequency, say 2, and the five others have frequency 20, 25, 20,
21, 18, then the mean will certainly not reflect the way the data behaves. So, in such
cases, the mean is not a good representative of the data.
In problems where individual observations are not important, and we wish to find
out a ‘typical’ observation, the median is more appropriate, e.g., finding the typical
productivity rate of workers, average wage in a country, etc. These are situations
where extreme values may be there. So, rather than the mean, we take the median as
a better measure of central tendency.
In situations which require establishing the most frequent value or most popular
item, the mode is the best choice, e.g., to find the most popular T.V. programme being
watched, the consumer item in greatest demand, the colour of the vehicle used by
most of the people, etc.
Remarks :
1. There is a empirical relationship between the three measures of central tendency :
3 Median = Mode + 2 Mean
2. The median of grouped data with unequal class sizes can also be calculated. However,
we shall not discuss it here.

The theory of probabilities and the theory of errors now constitute
a formidable body of great mathematical interest and of great
practical importance.
– R.S. Woodward

14.1 Probability — A Theoretical Approach
Let us consider the following situation :
Suppose a coin is tossed at random.
When we speak of a coin, we assume it to be ‘fair’, that is, it is symmetrical so
that there is no reason for it to come down more often on one side than the other.
We call this property of the coin as being ‘unbiased’. By the phrase ‘random toss’,
we mean that the coin is allowed to fall freely without any bias or interference.
We know, in advance, that the coin can only land in one of two possible ways —
either head up or tail up (we dismiss the possibility of its ‘landing’ on its edge, which
may be possible, for example, if it falls on sand). We can reasonably assume that each
outcome, head or tail, is as likely to occur as the other. We refer to this by saying that
the outcomes head and tail, are equally likely.
For another example of equally likely outcomes, suppose we throw a die
once. For us, a die will always mean a fair die. What are the possible outcomes?
They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Each number has the same possibility of showing up. So
the equally likely outcomes of throwing a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

Reprint 2025-26

PROBABILITY

203

Are the outcomes of every experiment equally likely? Let us see.
Suppose that a bag contains 4 red balls and 1 blue ball, and you draw a ball
without looking into the bag. What are the outcomes? Are the outcomes — a red ball
and a blue ball equally likely? Since there are 4 red balls and only one blue ball, you
would agree that you are more likely to get a red ball than a blue ball. So, the outcomes
(a red ball or a blue ball) are not equally likely. However, the outcome of drawing a
ball of any colour from the bag is equally likely. So, all experiments do not necessarily
have equally likely outcomes.
However, in this chapter, from now on, we will assume that all the experiments
have equally likely outcomes.
In Class IX, we defined the experimental or empirical probability P(E) of an
event E as

Number of trials in which the event happened
Total number of trials
The empirical interpretation of probability can be applied to every event associated
with an experiment which can be repeated a large number of times. The requirement
of repeating an experiment has some limitations, as it may be very expensive or
unfeasible in many situations. Of course, it worked well in coin tossing or die throwing
experiments. But how about repeating the experiment of launching a satellite in order
to compute the empirical probability of its failure during launching, or the repetition of
the phenomenon of an earthquake to compute the empirical probability of a multistoreyed building getting destroyed in an earthquake?
P(E) =

In experiments where we are prepared to make certain assumptions, the repetition
of an experiment can be avoided, as the assumptions help in directly calculating the
exact (theoretical) probability. The assumption of equally likely outcomes (which is
valid in many experiments, as in the two examples above, of a coin and of a die) is one
such assumption that leads us to the following definition of probability of an event.
The theoretical probability (also called classical probability) of an event E,
written as P(E), is defined as
P(E) =

Number of outcomes favourable to E
,
Number of all possible outcomes of the experiment

where we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely.
We will briefly refer to theoretical probability as probability.
This definition of probability was given by Pierre Simon Laplace in 1795.

MATHEMATICS

Probability theory had its origin in the 16th century when
an Italian physician and mathematician J.Cardan wrote the
first book on the subject, The Book on Games of Chance.
Since its inception, the study of probability has attracted
the attention of great mathematicians. James Bernoulli
(1654 – 1705), A. de Moivre (1667 – 1754), and
Pierre Simon Laplace are among those who made significant
contributions to this field. Laplace’s Theorie Analytique
des Probabilités, 1812, is considered to be the greatest
contribution by a single person to the theory of probability. Pierre Simon Laplace
(1749 – 1827)
In recent years, probability has been used extensively in
many areas such as biology, economics, genetics, physics,
sociology etc.
Let us find the probability for some of the events associated with experiments
where the equally likely assumption holds.
Example 1 : Find the probability of getting a head when a coin is tossed once. Also
find the probability of getting a tail.
Solution : In the experiment of tossing a coin once, the number of possible outcomes
is two — Head (H) and Tail (T). Let E be the event ‘getting a head’. The number of
outcomes favourable to E, (i.e., of getting a head) is 1. Therefore,
P(E) = P (head) =

Number of outcomes favourable to E
=

Number of all possible outcomes

Similarly, if F is the event ‘getting a tail’, then

Example 2 : A bag contains a red ball, a blue ball and a yellow ball, all the balls being
of the same size. Kritika takes out a ball from the bag without looking into it. What is
the probability that she takes out the
(i) yellow ball?

(ii) red ball?

(iii) blue ball?

Solution : Kritika takes out a ball from the bag without looking into it. So, it is equally
likely that she takes out any one of them.

205

Let Y be the event ‘the ball taken out is yellow’, B be the event ‘the ball taken
out is blue’, and R be the event ‘the ball taken out is red’.
Now, the number of possible outcomes = 3.

Remarks :
1. An event having only one outcome of the experiment is called an elementary
event. In Example 1, both the events E and F are elementary events. Similarly, in
Example 2, all the three events, Y, B and R are elementary events.
2. In Example 1, we note that : P(E) + P(F) = 1
In Example 2, we note that : P(Y) + P(R) + P(B) = 1
Observe that the sum of the probabilities of all the elementary events of
an experiment is 1. This is true in general also.
Example 3 : Suppose we throw a die once. (i) What is the probability of getting a
number greater than 4 ? (ii) What is the probability of getting a number less than or
equal to 4 ?
Solution : (i) Here, let E be the event ‘getting a number greater than 4’. The number
of possible outcomes is six : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and the outcomes favourable to E are 5
and 6. Therefore, the number of outcomes favourable to E is 2. So,

So, the number of outcomes favourable to F is 4.

Are the events E and F in the example above elementary events? No, they are
not because the event E has 2 outcomes and the event F has 4 outcomes.

P(E) + P(F) =

1 2

(2)

where E is the event ‘getting a number >4’ and F is the event ‘getting a number  4’.
Note that getting a number not greater than 4 is same as getting a number less
than or equal to 4, and vice versa.
In (1) and (2) above, is F not the same as ‘not E’? Yes, it is. We denote the event
‘not E’ by E .
So,
P(E) + P(not E) = 1
i.e.,

P(E) + P( E ) = 1,

which gives us P( E ) = 1 – P(E).

In general, it is true that for an event E,
P( E ) = 1 – P(E)
The event E , representing ‘not E’, is called the complement of the event E.
We also say that E and E are complementary events.
Before proceeding further, let us try to find the answers to the following questions:
(i) What is the probability of getting a number 8 in a single throw of a die?
(ii) What is the probability of getting a number less than 7 in a single throw of a die?
Let us answer (i) :
We know that there are only six possible outcomes in a single throw of a die. These
outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Since no face of the die is marked 8, so there is no
outcome favourable to 8, i.e., the number of such outcomes is zero. In other words,
getting 8 in a single throw of a die, is impossible.
So,

P(getting 8) =

0
=0
6

Reprint 2025-26

PROBABILITY

207

That is, the probability of an event which is impossible to occur is 0. Such an
event is called an impossible event.
Let us answer (ii) :
Since every face of a die is marked with a number less than 7, it is sure that we
will always get a number less than 7 when it is thrown once. So, the number of
favourable outcomes is the same as the number of all possible outcomes, which is 6.
Therefore,

P(E) = P(getting a number less than 7) =

6
=1

So, the probability of an event which is sure (or certain) to occur is 1. Such an event
is called a sure event or a certain event.
Note : From the definition of the probability P(E), we see that the numerator (number
of outcomes favourable to the event E) is always less than or equal to the denominator
(the number of all possible outcomes). Therefore,
0  P(E)  1
Now, let us take an example related to playing cards. Have you seen a deck of
playing cards? It consists of 52 cards which are divided into 4 suits of 13 cards each—
spades (), hearts (), diamonds () and clubs (). Clubs and spades are of black
colour, while hearts and diamonds are of red colour. The cards in each suit are ace,
king, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2. Kings, queens and jacks are called face
cards.
Example 4 : One card is drawn from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. Calculate the
probability that the card will
(i) be an ace,
(ii) not be an ace.
Solution : Well-shuffling ensures equally likely outcomes.
(i) There are 4 aces in a deck. Let E be the event ‘the card is an ace’.
The number of outcomes favourable to E = 4
The number of possible outcomes = 52

Example 5 : Two players, Sangeeta and Reshma, play a tennis match. It is known
that the probability of Sangeeta winning the match is 0.62. What is the probability of
Reshma winning the match?
Solution : Let S and R denote the events that Sangeeta wins the match and Reshma
wins the match, respectively.
The probability of Sangeeta’s winning = P(S) = 0.62 (given)
The probability of Reshma’s winning = P(R) = 1 – P(S)
[As the events R and S are complementary]
= 1 – 0.62 = 0.38
Example 6 : Savita and Hamida are friends. What is the probability that both will
have (i) different birthdays? (ii) the same birthday? (ignoring a leap year).
Solution : Out of the two friends, one girl, say, Savita’s birthday can be any day of the
year. Now, Hamida’s birthday can also be any day of 365 days in the year.
We assume that these 365 outcomes are equally likely.
(i) If Hamida’s birthday is different from Savita’s, the number of favourable outcomes
for her birthday is 365 – 1 = 364
So, P (Hamida’s birthday is different from Savita’s birthday) =

Example 7 : There are 40 students in Class X of a school of whom 25 are girls and 15
are boys. The class teacher has to select one student as a class representative. She
writes the name of each student on a separate card, the cards being identical. Then
she puts cards in a bag and stirs them thoroughly. She then draws one card from the
bag. What is the probability that the name written on the card is the name of (i) a girl?
(ii) a boy?
Solution : There are 40 students, and only one name card has to be chosen.

Solution : Saying that a marble is drawn at random is a short way of saying that all the
marbles are equally likely to be drawn. Therefore, the
number of possible outcomes = 3 +2 + 4 = 9

MATHEMATICS

Example 9 : Harpreet tosses two different coins simultaneously (say, one is of ` 1
and other of ` 2). What is the probability that she gets at least one head?
Solution : We write H for ‘head’ and T for ‘tail’. When two coins are tossed
simultaneously, the possible outcomes are (H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T), which are all
equally likely. Here (H, H) means head up on the first coin (say on ` 1) and head up
on the second coin (` 2). Similarly (H, T) means head up on the first coin and tail up on
the second coin and so on.
The outcomes favourable to the event E, ‘at least one head’ are (H, H), (H, T)
and (T, H). (Why?)
So, the number of outcomes favourable to E is 3.
Therefore,

P(E) =

Did you observe that in all the examples discussed so far, the number of possible
outcomes in each experiment was finite? If not, check it now.
P (E) = 1 – P(E) = 1 –

There are many experiments in which the outcome is any number between two
given numbers, or in which the outcome is every point within a circle or rectangle, etc.
Can you now count the number of all possible outcomes? As you know, this is not
possible since there are infinitely many numbers between two given numbers, or there
are infinitely many points within a circle. So, the definition of (theoretical) probability
which you have learnt so far cannot be applied in the present form. What is the way
out? To answer this, let us consider the following example :
Example 10* : In a musical chair game, the person playing the music has been
advised to stop playing the music at any time within 2 minutes after she starts
playing. What is the probability that the music will stop within the first half-minute
after starting?
Solution : Here the possible outcomes are all the numbers between 0 and 2. This is
the portion of the number line from 0 to 2 (see Fig. 14.1).

rectangular region shown in Fig. 14.2. What is the probability that it crashed inside the
lake shown in the figure?

Example 12 : A carton consists of 100 shirts of which 88 are good, 8 have minor
defects and 4 have major defects. Jimmy, a trader, will only accept the shirts which
are good, but Sujatha, another trader, will only reject the shirts which have major
defects. One shirt is drawn at random from the carton. What is the probability that
(i) it is acceptable to Jimmy?
(ii) it is acceptable to Sujatha?
Solution : One shirt is drawn at random from the carton of 100 shirts. Therefore,
there are 100 equally likely outcomes.
(i) The number of outcomes favourable (i.e., acceptable) to Jimmy = 88 (Why?)
Therefore, P (shirt is acceptable to Jimmy) =

(iii) less than or equal to 12?

Solution : When the blue die shows ‘1’, the grey die could show any one of the
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The same is true when the blue die shows ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’, ‘5’ or
‘6’. The possible outcomes of the experiment are listed in the table below; the first
number in each ordered pair is the number appearing on the blue die and the second

14.2 Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points :
1. The theoretical (classical) probability of an event E, written as P(E), is defined as

P (E) =

Number of outcomes favourable to E
Number of all possible outcomes of the experiment

where we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely.
2. The probability of a sure event (or certain event) is 1.
3. The probability of an impossible event is 0.
4. The probability of an event E is a number P(E) such that
0  P (E)  1
5. An event having only one outcome is called an elementary event. The sum of the
probabilities of all the elementary events of an experiment is 1.
6. For any event E, P (E) + P ( E ) = 1, where E stands for ‘not E’. E and E are called
complementary events.

A NOTE TO THE READER
The experimental or empirical probability of an event is based on
what has actually happened while the theoretical probability of the
event attempts to predict what will happen on the basis of certain
assumptions. As the number of trials in an experiment, go on
increasing we may expect the experimental and theoretical
probabilities to be nearly the same.

To prove that (√2 − √5) is an irrational number, we will use the contradiction
Method.
Let, if possible, √2 − √5 = 𝑥, where 𝑥 is any rational number (Clearly 𝑥 ≠ 0)
so, √2 = 𝑥 + √5 ⟹ 2 = (𝑥 + √5 )

⟹ 2 = 𝑥 2 + 5 + 2√5𝑥
⟹ −𝑥 2 − 3 = 2√5𝑥

(Note: √5 is an irrational number, as the square root of any prime number is

In equation (1), LHS is a rational number while RHS is an irrational number
but an irrational number cannot be equal to a rational number.
So, our assumption is wrong.

Q36.

Carpooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a
car, and prevents the need for others to have to drive to a location themselves. By
having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each person’s travel
costs such as: fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving. Carpooling is also a more
environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces
air pollution, carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for
parking spaces.

Q7. Three friends Amar, Bhavin and Chetanya live in societies represented by the points
A(4,5), B(6,2) and C(2,6) respectively. They all work in offices located in a same
building represented by the point O(0,0). Since they all go to same building every
day, they decided to do carpooling to save money on petrol. Based on the above
information, answer the following questions.
Q8.
i) What is the distance between B and C?
ii) If Bhavin and Chetanya planned to meet at a club situated at the mid-point of
the line joining the points B and C, find the coordinates of this point.
