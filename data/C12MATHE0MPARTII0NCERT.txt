7.1  Introduction

Differential Calculus is centred on the concept of the
derivative. The original motivation for the derivative was
the problem of defining tangent lines to the graphs of
functions and calculating the slope of such lines. Integral
Calculus is motivated by the problem of defining and
calculating the area of the region bounded by the graph of
the functions.

If a function f  is differentiable in an interval I, i.e., its
derivative f ′exists at each point of I, then a natural question
arises that given f ′at each point of I, can we determine
the function? The functions that could possibly have given
function as a derivative are called anti derivatives (or G .W. Leibnitz

primitive) of the function. Further, the formula that gives (1646 -1716)

all these anti derivatives is called the indefinite integral of the function and such
process of finding anti derivatives is called integration. Such type of problems arise in
many practical situations. For instance, if we know the instantaneous velocity of an
object at any instant, then there arises a natural question, i.e., can we determine the
position of the object at any instant? There are several such practical and theoretical
situations where the process of integration is involved. The development of integral
calculus arises out of the efforts of solving the problems of the following types:
(a) the problem of finding a function whenever its derivative is given,
(b) the problem of finding the area bounded by the graph of a function under certain

conditions.
These  two problems lead to the two forms of the integrals, e.g., indefinite and

definite integrals, which together constitute the Integral Calculus.

There is a connection, known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, between
indefinite integral and definite integral which makes the definite integral as a practical
tool for science and engineering. The definite integral is also used to solve many interesting
problems from various disciplines like economics, finance and probability.

In this Chapter, we shall confine ourselves to the study of indefinite and definite
integrals and their elementary properties including some techniques of integration.

7.2  Integration as an Inverse Process of Differentiation

Integration is the inverse process of differentiation. Instead of differentiating a function,
we are given the derivative of a function and asked to find its primitive, i.e., the original
function. Such a process is called integration or anti differentiation.
Let us consider the following examples:

d
We know that (sin x)  = cos x ... (1)

dx

3
d x

( )  = x2 ... (2)
dx 3

d x
and (e ) = ex ... (3)

dx
We observe that in (1), the function cos x is the derived function of sin x. We say

x3

that sin x is an anti derivative (or an integral) of cos x. Similarly, in (2) and (3),  and
3

ex are the anti derivatives (or integrals) of x2 and ex, respectively. Again, we note that
for any real number C, treated as constant function, its derivative is zero and hence, we
can write (1), (2) and (3) as follows :

d 3
d x 2 d x

(sin x + C) = co x , ( + C) = x
s x and (e + C) = e

dx dx 3 dx
Thus, anti derivatives (or integrals) of the above cited functions are not unique.

Actually, there exist infinitely many anti derivatives of each of these functions which
can be obtained by choosing C arbitrarily from the set of real numbers. For this reason
C is customarily referred to as arbitrary constant. In fact, C is the parameter by
varying which one gets different anti derivatives (or integrals) of the given function.

d
More generally, if there is a function F such that F (x) = f (x) , ∀ x ∈ I (interval),

dx
then for any arbitrary real number C, (also called constant of integration)

d [F (x) + C]  = f (x), x ∈ I
dx

INTEGRALS         227

Thus, {F + C, C ∈ R} denotes a family of anti derivatives of f.

Remark  Functions with same derivatives differ by a constant. To show this, let g and h
be two functions having the same derivatives on an interval I.

Consider the function f = g – h defined by f (x) = g (x) – h(x), ∀ x ∈ I

df
Then = f′ = g′  – h′ giving  f′ (x) = g′ (x) – h′ (x) ∀ x ∈ I

dx

or f′ (x) = 0, ∀ x ∈ I by hypothesis,
i.e., the rate of change of f with respect to x is zero on I and hence f is constant.

In view of the above remark, it is justified to infer that the family {F + C, C ∈ R}
provides all possible anti derivatives of f.

We introduce a new symbol, namely, ∫ f (x) dx  which will represent the entire

class of anti derivatives read as the indefinite integral of f with respect to x.

Symbolically, we write ∫ f (x) dx = F (x) + C .

dy
Notation Given that  = f (x) , we write y =

We already know the formulae for the derivatives of many important functions.
From these formulae, we can write down immediately the corresponding formulae
(referred to as standard formulae) for the integrals of these functions, as listed below

7.2.1 Some properties of indefinite integral
In this sub section, we shall derive some properties of indefinite integrals.

(I) The process of differentiation and integration are inverses of each other in the
sense of the following results :

d
f (x) dx

dx ∫  = f (x)

and ∫ f ′(x) dx  = f (x) + C, where C is any arbitrary constant.

Proof Let F be any anti derivative of f, i.e.,

d
F(x)  = f (x)

dx

Then ∫ f (x) dx  = F(x) + C

d d
Therefore ∫ f (x) dx  = (F (x) + C)

dx dx

d
= F (x) = f (x)

dx
Similarly, we note that

d
f ′(x) = f (x)

dx

and hence ∫ f ′(x) dx  = f (x) + C

where C is arbitrary constant called constant of integration.

(II) Two indefinite integrals with the same derivative lead to the same family of
curves and so they are equivalent.

Proof Let f and g be two functions such that

d d
f (x) dx ∫ g x x

dx ∫  = ( ) d
dx

d
or 

∫ f (x) dx – ∫ g (x) dx  = 0
dx 

Hence ∫ f (x) dx – ∫ g (x) dx = C, where C is any real number   (Why?)

or ∫ f (x) dx  = ∫ g (x) dx + C

So the families of curves {∫ f (x) dx + C1, C1 ∈R}
and {∫ g(x) dx + C2 , C2 ∈R}  are identical.

Hence, in this sense, ∫ f (x) dx and ∫ g(x) dx  are equivalent.

A Note The equivalence of the families {∫ f (x) dx + C1,C1 ∈ R}  and

{∫ g(x) dx + C2 ,C2 ∈R}  is customarily expressed by writing ∫ f (x) dx = ∫ g(x) dx ,

without mentioning the parameter.

(III) ∫[ f (x) + g(x)] dx = ∫ f (x) dx + ∫ g(x) dx

Proof By Property (I), we have

d 
∫[ f (x) + g(x)] dx  = f (x) + g (x)

dx  ... (1)

 On the otherhand, we find that

d  d d
∫ f (x) dx+ ∫ g(x) dx  = f ( ) + ( )

dx  ∫ x dx ∫ g x dx
dx dx

= f (x) + g (x) ... (2)
  Thus, in view of Property (II), it follows by (1) and (2)  that

∫ ( f (x) + g(x)) dx = ∫ f (x) dx + ∫ g(x) dx .

(IV)  For any real number k, ∫ k f (x) dx = k ∫ f (x) dx

Proof By the Property (I), ∫ k f (x) dx = k f (x) .

dx  dx

 Therefore, using the Property (II), we have ∫ k f (x) dx = k ∫ f (x) dx .

(V) Properties (III) and (IV) can be generalised to a finite number of functions
f , f , ..., f  and the real numbers, k , k , ..., k  giving
1 2 n 1 2 n

∫[k1 f1(x) + k2 f2 (x) + ...+ kn fn (x)] dx

= k1∫ f1(x) dx + k2 ∫ f2 (x) dx + ...+ kn ∫ fn (x) dx .

To find an anti derivative of a given function, we search intuitively for a function
whose derivative is the given function. The search for the requisite function for finding
an anti derivative is known as integration by the method of inspection. We illustrate it
through some examples.

Example 1 Write an anti derivative for each of the following functions using the
method of inspection:

1
(i) cos 2x (ii) 3x2 + 4x3 (iii) , x ≠ 0

x

Solution

(i) We look for a function whose derivative is cos 2x. Recall that

d
 sin 2x = 2 cos 2x

dx

1 d d  1 
or cos 2x =  (sin 2x) =  sin 2x 

2 dx dx  2 

1
Therefore, an anti derivative of cos 2x is sin 2x .

2

(ii) We look for a function whose derivative is 3x2 + 4x3. Note that

d ( 3 4
x + x ) = 3x2 + 4x3.

dx

Therefore, an anti derivative of 3x2 + 4x3  is  x3 + x4.

Example 4 Find the anti derivative F of  f defined by f (x) = 4x3 – 6, where F (0) = 3

Solution One anti derivative of f (x) is x4 – 6x since

d
(x4 – 6x)  = 4x3 – 6

dx

Therefore, the anti derivative F is given by

F(x) = x4 – 6x + C, where C is constant.

Reprint 2025-26



234 MATHEMATICS

Given that F(0) = 3, which gives,

3 = 0 – 6 × 0 + C    or    C = 3

Hence, the required anti derivative is the unique function F defined by

F(x) = x4 – 6x + 3.

Remarks

(i) We see that if F is an anti derivative of f, then so is F + C, where C is any
constant. Thus, if we know one anti derivative F of a function f, we can write
down an infinite number of anti derivatives of f by adding any constant to F
expressed by F(x)  + C, C ∈ R. In applications, it is often necessary to satisfy an
additional condition which then determines a specific value of C giving unique
anti derivative of the given function.

(ii) Sometimes, F is not expressible in terms of elementary functions viz., polynomial,
logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric functions and their inverses etc. We are

therefore blocked for finding ∫ f (x) dx . For example, it is not possible to find

2
– x

∫ e dx – x2

 by inspection since we can not find a function whose derivative is e

(iii) When the variable of integration is denoted by a variable other than x, the integral
formulae are modified accordingly. For instance

7.3  Methods of Integration
In previous section, we discussed integrals of those functions which were readily
obtainable from derivatives of some functions. It was based on inspection, i.e., on the
search of a function F whose derivative is f which led us to the integral of f. However,
this method, which depends on inspection, is not very suitable for many functions.
Hence, we need to develop additional techniques or methods for finding the integrals
by reducing them into standard forms. Prominent among them are methods based on:

1. Integration by Substitution

2. Integration using Partial Fractions

3. Integration by Parts

7.3.1 Integration by substitution

In this section, we consider the method of integration by substitution.

The given integral ∫ f (x) dx  can be transformed into another form by changing

the independent variable x to t by substituting x = g (t).

Reprint 2025-26



236 MATHEMATICS

Consider I = ∫ f (x) dx

dx
Put x = g(t) so that  = g′(t).

dt
We write dx = g′(t) dt

Thus I = ∫ f (x) dx = ∫ f (g(t)) g′(t) dt

This change of variable formula is one of the important tools available to us in the
name of integration by substitution. It is often important to guess what will be the useful
substitution. Usually, we make a substitution for a function whose derivative also occurs
in the integrand as illustrated in the following examples.

Example 5 Integrate the following functions w.r.t. x:

(i) sin mx (ii) 2x sin (x2 + 1)

tan x sec x sin (tan– x)

(iii) (iv) 2

Solution
(i) We know that derivative of mx is m. Thus, we make the substitution

mx = t so that mdx = dt.

Therefore,      ∫sin mx dx = ∫sin t dt  =  – cos t + C  = – cos mx + C

m m m

(ii) Derivative of x2 + 1 is 2x. Thus, we use the substitution x2 + 1 = t so that
2x dx = dt.

2
Therefore,  ∫ 2x sin (x +1) dx = ∫sin t dt  =  – cos t + C  = – cos (x2 + 1) + C

their standard integrals using substitution technique. These will be used later without
reference.

7.5  Integration by Partial Fractions

Recall that a rational function is defined as the ratio of two polynomials in the form

P(x)
, where P (x) and Q(x) are polynomials in x and Q(x) ≠ 0. If the degree of P(x)

Q(x)

is less than the degree of Q(x), then the rational function is called proper, otherwise, it
is called improper. The improper rational functions can be reduced to the proper rational

functions by long division process. Thus, if  is improper, then = T(x) + 1 ,

Q(x) Q(x) Q(x)

P1(x)
where T(x) is a polynomial in x and is a proper rational function. As we know

Q(x)

how to integrate polynomials, the integration of any rational function is reduced to the
integration of a proper rational function. The rational functions which we shall consider
here for integration purposes will be those whose denominators can be factorised into

P(x) P(x)
linear and quadratic factors. Assume that we want to evaluate ∫ dx , where 

Q(x) Q(x)

is proper rational function. It is always possible to write the integrand as a sum of
simpler rational functions by a method called partial fraction decomposition. After this,
the integration can be carried out easily using the already known methods. The following
Table 7.2 indicates the types of simpler partial fractions that are to be associated with
various kind of rational functions.

Solution The integrand is a proper rational function. Therefore, by using the form of
partial fraction [Table 7.2 (i)], we write

1 A B
 = + ... (1)

(x +1) (x + 2) x +1 x + 2

where, real numbers A and B are to be determined suitably. This gives

1 = A (x + 2) + B (x + 1).

Equating the coefficients of x and the constant term, we get

7.6  Integration by Parts
In this section, we describe one more method of integration, that is found quite useful in
integrating products of functions.

If u and v are any two differentiable functions of a single variable x (say). Then, by
the product rule of differentiation, we have

d dv du
(uv)  = u + v

dx dx dx
Integrating both sides, we get

uv = ∫u dx + v dx

dx ∫ dx

or ∫u dx  = uv – ∫ v dx ... (1)

Reprint 2025-26

Therefore, expression (1) can be rewritten as

∫ f (x) g(x) dx  = f (x)∫ g(x) dx – ∫[∫ g(x) dx] f ′(x) dx

i.e., ∫ f (x) g (x) dx  = f (x)∫ g (x) dx – ∫[ f ′ (x) ∫ g(x) dx] dx

If we take f as the first function and g as the second function, then this formula
may be stated as follows:

“The integral of the product of two functions = (first function) × (integral
of the second function) – Integral of [(differential coefficient of the first function)
× (integral of the second function)]”

Example 17 Find ∫ x cos x dx

Solution Put f (x) = x (first function) and g (x) = cos x (second function).

Then, integration by parts gives

d
∫ x cos x dx  = x ∫cos x dx – ∫[ (x) ∫cos x dx] dx

dx

= x sin x – ∫sin x dx  = x sin x + cos x + C

Suppose, we take f (x) = cos x and g (x) = x. Then

d
∫ x cos x dx  = cos x ∫ x dx – ∫[ (cos x) ∫ x dx] dx

dx

x2 2

= ( x
cos x) + ∫sin x dx

2 2

Thus, it shows that the integral ∫ x cos x dx  is reduced to the comparatively more

complicated integral having more power of x. Therefore, the proper choice of the first
function and the second function is significant.

Remarks

(i) It is worth mentioning that integration by parts is not applicable to product of

functions in all cases. For instance, the method does not work for ∫ x sin x dx .

The reason is that there does not exist any function whose derivative is

x  sin x.

(ii) Observe that while finding the integral of the second function, we did not add
any constant of integration. If we write the integral of the second function cos x

Reprint 2025-26



INTEGRALS         261

as sin x + k, where k is any constant, then

∫ x cos x dx  = x (sin x + k ) − ∫ (sin x + k ) dx

= x (sin x + k ) − ∫ (sin x dx − ∫ k dx

= x (sin x + k) − cos x – kx + C  = x sin x + cos x + C

This shows that adding a constant to the integral of the second function is
superfluous so far as the final result is concerned while applying the method of
integration by parts.

(iii) Usually, if any function is a power of x or a polynomial in x, then we take it as the
first function. However, in cases where other function is inverse trigonometric
function or logarithmic function, then we take them as first function.

Example 18 Find ∫ log x dx

Solution To start with, we are unable to guess a function whose derivative is log x. We
take log x as the first function and the constant function 1 as the second function. Then,
the integral of the second function is x.

7.7   Definite Integral

In the previous sections, we have studied about the indefinite integrals and discussed
few methods of finding them including integrals of some special functions. In this
section, we shall study what is called definite integral of a function. The definite integral

b
has a unique value. A definite integral is denoted by ∫ f (x) dx , where a is called the

a

lower limit of the integral and b is called the upper limit of the integral. The definite
integral is introduced either as the limit of a sum or if it has an anti derivative F in the
interval [a, b], then its value is the difference  between the values of F at the end
points, i.e., F(b) – F(a).

7.8  Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

7.8.1  Area function

b
We have defined ∫ f (x) dx  as the area of

a

the region bounded by the curve y = f (x),
the ordinates x = a and x = b and x-axis. Let x

x
be a given point in [a, b]. Then ∫ f (x) dx

a

represents the area of the light shaded region
in Fig 7.1 [Here it is assumed that f (x) > 0 for
x ∈ [a, b], the assertion made below is

In other words, the area of this shaded region is a function of x. We denote this
function of x by A(x). We call the function A(x) as Area function and is given by

Based on this definition, the two basic fundamental theorems have been given.
However, we only state them as their proofs are beyond the scope of this text book.

7.8.2  First fundamental theorem of integral calculus

Theorem 1 Let f be a continuous function on the closed interval [a, b] and let A (x) be
the area function. Then A′(x) = f (x), for all x ∈ [a, b].

7.8.3  Second fundamental theorem of integral calculus

We state below an important theorem which enables us to evaluate definite integrals
by making use of anti derivative.

Theorem 2 Let f  be continuous function defined on the closed interval [a, b] and F be

b
an anti derivative of f. Then ∫ f (x) dx = [F( x)] b

a =  F (b) – F(a).
a

Remarks
b

(i) In words, the Theorem 2 tells us that ∫ f (x) dx = (value of the anti derivative F
a

of f at the upper limit b – value of the same anti derivative at the lower limit a).

(ii) This theorem is very useful, because it gives us a method of calculating the
definite integral more easily, without calculating the limit of a sum.

(iii) The crucial operation in evaluating a definite integral is that of finding a function
whose derivative is equal to the integrand. This strengthens the relationship
between differentiation and integration.

b
(iv) In ∫ f (x) dx , the function f needs to be well defined and continuous in [a, b].

a

3

For instance, the consideration of definite integral 2
∫ x(x –1)2 dx  is erroneous

−2

2

since the function f expressed by f (x) = x(x –1)2  is not defined in a portion

– 1 < x < 1 of the closed interval [– 2, 3].
b

Steps for calculating ∫ f (x) dx .
a

(i) Find the indefinite integral ∫ f (x) dx . Let this be F(x). There is no need to keep

integration constant C because if we consider F(x) + C instead of F(x), we get
b b
∫ f (x) dx = [F (x) + C]a = [F(b) + C] – [F(a) + C] = F(b) – F(a) .

a

Thus, the arbitrary constant disappears in evaluating the value of the definite
integral.

b b
(ii) Evaluate F(b) – F(a) = [F (x)]a , which is the value of  ∫ f (x) dx .

7.9  Evaluation of Definite Integrals by Substitution

In the previous sections, we have discussed several methods for finding the indefinite
integral. One of the important methods for finding the indefinite integral is the method
of substitution.

b
To evaluate ∫ f (x) dx , by substitution, the steps could be as follows:

a

1. Consider the integral without limits and substitute, y = f (x) or x = g(y) to reduce
the given integral to a known form.

2. Integrate the new integrand with respect to the new variable without mentioning
the constant of integration.

3. Resubstitute for the new variable and write the answer in terms of the original
variable.

4. Find the values of answers obtained in (3) at the given limits of integral and find
the difference of the values at the upper and lower limits.

Reprint 2025-26



272 MATHEMATICS

ANote In order to quicken this method, we can proceed as follows: After

performing steps 1, and 2, there is no need of step 3. Here, the integral will be kept
in the new variable itself, and the limits of the integral will accordingly be changed,
so that we can perform the last step.

Let us illustrate this by examples.

Example 26 Evaluate 5 4 5

∫ x x +1 dx .

Solution Put  t = x5 + 1, then dt = 5x4 dx.

3   3 3

Alternatively, first we transform the integral and then evaluate the transformed integral
with new limits.

Let t = x5 + 1. Then dt = 5 x4 dx.
Note that, when x = – 1, t = 0 and when x = 1, t = 2
Thus,  as x varies from – 1 to 1, t varies from 0 to 2

Summary

® Integration is the inverse process of differentiation. In the differential calculus,
we are given a function and we have to find the derivative or differential of
this function, but in the integral calculus, we are to find a function whose
differential is given. Thus, integration is a process which is the inverse of
differentiation.

d
Let F(x) = f (x) . Then we write ∫ f (x) dx = F (x) + C . These integrals

dx
are called indefinite integrals or general integrals, C is called constant of
integration. All these integrals differ by a constant.

® Some properties of indefinite integrals are as follows:

1. ∫[ f (x) + g (x)] dx = ∫ f (x) dx + ∫ g (x) dx

2. For any real number k, ∫ k f (x) dx = k∫ f (x) dx

More generally, if f , f , f , ... , f  are functions and k , k , ... ,k  are real

® Integration by substitution

A change in the variable of integration often reduces an integral to one of the
fundamental integrals. The method in which we change the variable to some
other variable is called the method of substitution. When the integrand involves
some trigonometric functions, we use some well known identities to find the
integrals. Using substitution technique, we obtain the following standard
integrals.

(i) ∫ tan x dx = log sec x + C (ii) ∫cot x dx = log sin x + C

APPLICATION OF INTEGRALS

v One should study Mathematics because it is only through Mathematics that
nature can be conceived in harmonious form. – BIRKHOFF v

8.1  Introduction
In geometry, we have learnt formulae to calculate areas
of various geometrical figures including triangles,
rectangles, trapezias and circles. Such formulae are
fundamental in the applications of mathematics to many
real life problems. The formulae of elementary geometry
allow us to calculate areas of many simple figures.
However, they are inadequate for calculating the areas
enclosed by curves. For that we shall need some concepts
of Integral Calculus.

In the previous chapter, we have studied to find the
area bounded by the curve y = f (x), the ordinates x = a,
x = b and x-axis, while calculating definite integral as the
limit of a sum. Here, in this chapter, we shall study a specific
application of integrals to find the area under simple curves, A.L. Cauchy
area between lines and arcs of circles, parabolas and (1789-1857)
ellipses (standard forms only). We shall also deal with finding
the area bounded by the above said curves.

8.2 Area under Simple Curves
In the previous chapter, we have studied
definite integral as the limit of a sum and
how to evaluate definite integral using
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Now,
we consider the easy and intuitive way of
finding the area bounded by the curve
y = f (x), x-axis and the ordinates x = a and
x = b. From Fig 8.1, we can think of area
under the curve as composed of large
number of very thin vertical strips. Consider
an arbitrary strip of height y and width dx,
then dA (area of the elementary strip)= ydx,
where, y = f (x). Fig 8.1

Reprint 2025-26



APPLICATION OF INTEGRALS         293

This area is called the elementary area which is located at an arbitrary position
within the region which is specified by some value of x between a and b. We can think
of the total area A of the region between x-axis, ordinates x = a, x = b and the curve
y = f (x) as the result of adding up the elementary areas of thin strips across the region
PQRSP. Symbolically, we express

b b b

A = ∫ dA = ∫ ydx = ∫ f (x) dx
a a a

The area A of the region bounded by
the curve x = g (y), y-axis and the lines y  =  c,
y = d is given by

d d

A = ∫ xdy = ∫ g(y) dy
c c

Here, we consider horizontal strips as shown in
the Fig 8.2 Fig  8.2

Remark If the position of the curve under consideration is below the x-axis, then since
f (x) < 0 from x = a to x = b, as shown in Fig 8.3, the area bounded by the curve, x-axis
and the ordinates x = a, x = b come out to be negative. But, it is only the numerical
value of the area which is taken into consideration. Thus, if the area is negative, we

b
take its absolute value, i.e., ∫ f (x) dx .

a

Fig 8.3

Generally, it may happen that some portion of the curve is above x-axis and some is
below the x-axis as shown in the Fig 8.4. Here, A  < 0 and A  > 0. Therefore, the area

1 2

A bounded by the curve y = f (x), x-axis and the ordinates x = a and x = b is given
by A = |A | + A .

Historical Note

The origin of the Integral Calculus goes back to the early period of development
of Mathematics and it is related to the method of exhaustion developed by the
mathematicians of ancient Greece. This method arose in the solution of problems
on calculating areas of plane figures, surface areas and volumes of solid bodies
etc. In this sense, the method of exhaustion can be regarded as an early method

Reprint 2025-26



APPLICATION OF INTEGRALS         299

of integration. The greatest development of method of exhaustion in the early
period was obtained in the works of Eudoxus (440 B.C.) and Archimedes
(300 B.C.)

Systematic approach to the theory of Calculus began in the 17th century.
In 1665, Newton began his work on the Calculus described by him as the theory
of fluxions and used his theory in finding the tangent and radius of curvature at
any point on a curve. Newton introduced the basic notion of inverse function
called the anti derivative (indefinite integral) or the inverse method of tangents.

During 1684-86, Leibnitz published an article in the Acta Eruditorum which
he called Calculas summatorius, since it was connected with the summation of
a number of infinitely small areas, whose sum, he indicated by the symbol ‘∫’. In
1696, he followed a suggestion made by J. Bernoulli and changed this article to
Calculus integrali. This corresponded to Newton’s inverse method of tangents.

Both Newton and Leibnitz adopted quite independent lines of approach which
was radically different. However, respective theories accomplished results that
were practically identical. Leibnitz used the notion of definite integral and what is
quite certain is that he first clearly appreciated tie up between the antiderivative
and the definite integral.

Conclusively, the fundamental concepts and theory of Integral Calculus and
primarily its relationships with Differential Calculus were developed in the work
of P.de Fermat, I. Newton and G. Leibnitz at the end of 17th century. However,
this justification by the concept of limit was only developed in the works of A.L.
Cauchy in the early 19th century. Lastly, it is worth mentioning the following
quotation by Lie Sophie’s:

“It may be said that the conceptions of differential quotient and integral which
in their origin certainly go back to Archimedes were introduced in Science by the
investigations of Kepler, Descartes, Cavalieri, Fermat and Wallis .... The discovery
that differentiation and integration are inverse operations belongs to Newton
and Leibnitz”.

DIFFERENTIAL  EQUATIONS

vHe who seeks for methods without having a definite problem in mind
seeks for the most part in vain. – D. HILBERT v

9.1  Introduction

In Class XI and in Chapter 5 of the present book, we
discussed how to differentiate a given function f with respect
to an independent variable, i.e., how to find f ′(x) for a given
function f at each x in its domain of definition. Further, in
the chapter on Integral Calculus, we discussed  how to find
a function f whose derivative is the function g, which may
also be formulated as follows:

For a given function g, find a function f such that

dy
 = g (x), where y = f (x)                   ... (1)

dx

An equation of the form (1) is known as a differential Henri Poincare

equation. A formal definition will be given later. (1854-1912 )

These equations arise in a variety of applications, may it be in Physics, Chemistry,
Biology, Anthropology, Geology,  Economics etc. Hence, an indepth study of differential
equations has assumed prime importance in all modern scientific investigations.

In this chapter, we will study some basic concepts related to differential equation,
general and particular solutions of a differential equation, formation of differential
equations, some methods to solve a first order - first degree differential equation and
some applications of differential equations in different areas.

9.2  Basic Concepts

We are already familiar with the equations of the type:

x2 – 3x + 3 = 0 ... (1)
sin x + cos x = 0 ... (2)

x + y = 7 ... (3)

Reprint 2025-26



DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 301

Let us consider the equation:

dy
x + y  = 0 ... (4)

dx
We see that equations (1), (2) and (3) involve independent and/or dependent variable

(variables) only but equation (4) involves variables as well as derivative of the dependent
variable y with respect to the independent variable x. Such an equation is called a
differential equation.

In general, an equation involving  derivative (derivatives) of the dependent variable
with respect to independent variable (variables) is called a differential equation.

A differential equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect
to only one independent variable is called an ordinary differential equation, e.g.,

3
d 2 y

+ 
dy 

2  0  s an ordinary differential equation .... (5)
dx2   =  i  

 dx 
Of course, there are differential equations involving derivatives with respect to

more than one independent variables, called partial differential equations but at this
stage we shall confine ourselves to the study of ordinary differential equations only.
Now onward, we will use the term ‘differential equation’ for ‘ordinary differential
equation’.

ANote

1. We shall prefer to use the following notations for derivatives:

2. For derivatives of higher order, it will be inconvenient  to use so many dashes

9.2.1.  Order of a differential equation

Order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of
the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given
differential equation.

Consider the following differential equations:

dy
 = ex ... (6)

 3   2

d y 2 d y 
  + x   = 0 ... (8)
 dx3

  dx2 

The equations (6), (7) and (8) involve the highest derivative of first, second and

third order respectively. Therefore, the order of these equations are 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

9.2.2  Degree of a differential equation

To study the degree of a differential equation, the key point is that the differential
equation must be a polynomial equation in derivatives, i.e., y′, y″, y″′ etc. Consider the

following differential equations:

2
3 2

d y  d y  dy
+ 2

3   − + y  = 0 ... (9)

 dx   dx 

dy  dy
+ 

sin    = 0 ... (11)
dx  dx 

We observe that equation (9) is a polynomial equation in y″′,  y″ and y′, equation (10)
is a polynomial equation in y′ (not a polynomial in y though). Degree of such differential
equations can be defined. But equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in y′ and
degree of such a differential equation can not be defined.

By the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in
derivatives, we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order
derivative involved in the given differential equation.

In view of the above definition, one may observe that differential equations (6), (7),
(8) and (9) each are of degree one, equation (10) is of degree two while the degree of
differential equation (11) is not defined.

ANote   Order and degree (if defined) of a differential equation are always

positive integers.

Solution of equations (1) and (2) are numbers, real or complex, that will satisfy the

function φ that will satisfy it i.e., when the function φ is substituted for the unknown y
(dependent variable) in the given differential equation, L.H.S. becomes equal to R.H.S..

The curve y = φ (x) is called the solution curve (integral curve) of the given
differential equation. Consider the function given by

y = φ (x) = a sin (x + b), ... (4)

where a, b ∈ R. When this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3),
L.H.S. = R.H.S.. So it is a solution of the differential equation (3).

general solution of the given differential equation. Whereas function φ  contains no

arbitrary constants but only the particular values of the parameters a and b and hence
is called a particular solution of the given differential equation.

The solution which contains  arbitrary constants is called the general solution
(primitive) of the differential equation.

The solution free from arbitrary constants i.e., the solution obtained from the general
solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular

If F (x, y) can be expressed as a product g (x) h(y), where, g(x) is a function of x

separable type. The differential equation (1) then has the form

Summary

® An equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to
independent variable (variables) is known as a differential equation.

® Order of a differential equation is the order of the highest order derivative
occurring in the differential equation.

® Degree of a differential equation is defined if it is a polynomial equation in its
derivatives.

® Degree (when defined) of a differential equation is the highest power (positive
integer only) of the highest order derivative in it.

® A function which satisfies the given differential equation is called its solution.
The solution which contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the
differential equation is called a general solution and the solution free from
arbitrary constants is called particular solution.

® Variable separable method is used to solve such an equation in which variables
can be separated completely i.e. terms containing y should remain with dy
and terms containing x should remain with dx.

® A differential equation which can be expressed in the form

dy dx
= f (x, y) or = g(x, y) where, f (x, y) and g(x, y) are homogenous

functions of degree zero is called a homogeneous differential equation.

dy
® A differential equation of the form +Py = Q , where P and Q are  constants

or functions of x only  is called a first order linear differential equation.

Historical Note

One of the principal languages of Science is that of differential equations.
Interestingly, the date of birth of differential equations is taken to be November,
11,1675, when Gottfried Wilthelm Freiherr Leibnitz (1646 - 1716) first put in black

1
and white the identity 2

∫ y dy = y , thereby introducing both the symbols ∫ and dy.
2

Leibnitz was actually interested in the problem of finding a curve whose tangents
were prescribed. This led him to discover the ‘method of separation of variables’
1691. A year later he formulated the ‘method of solving the homogeneous

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 337

differential equations of the first order’. He went further in a very short time
to the discovery of the ‘method of solving a linear differential equation of the
first-order’. How surprising is it that all these methods came from a single man
and that too within 25 years of the birth of differential equations!

In the old days, what we now call the ‘solution’ of a differential equation, was
used to be referred to as ‘integral’ of the differential equation, the word being
coined by James Bernoulli (1654 - 1705) in 1690. The word ‘solution was first
used by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 - 1813) in 1774, which was almost hundred
years since the birth of differential equations. It was Jules Henri Poincare
(1854 - 1912) who strongly advocated the use of the word ‘solution’ and thus the
word ‘solution’ has found its deserved place in modern terminology. The name of
the ‘method of separation of variables’ is due to John Bernoulli (1667 - 1748),
a younger brother of James Bernoulli.

Application to geometric problems were also considered. It was again John
Bernoulli who first brought into light the intricate nature of differential equations.
In a letter to Leibnitz, dated May 20, 1715, he revealed the solutions of the
differential equation

x2 y″ = 2y,

which led to three types of curves, viz., parabolas, hyperbolas and a class of
cubic curves. This shows how varied the solutions of such innocent looking
differential equation can be. From the second half of the twentieth century attention
has been drawn to the investigation of this complicated nature of the solutions of
differential equations, under the heading ‘qualitative analysis of differential
equations’. Now-a-days, this has acquired prime importance being absolutely
necessary in almost all investigations.

VECTOR ALGEBRA

v In most sciences one generation tears down what another has built and what
one has established another undoes. In Mathematics alone each generation

builds a new story to the old structure. – HERMAN HANKEL v

10.1  Introduction

In our day to day life, we come across many queries such
as – What is your height? How should a football player hit
the ball to give a pass to another player of his team? Observe
that a possible answer to the first query may be 1.6 meters,
a quantity that involves only one value (magnitude) which
is a real number. Such quantities are called scalars.
However, an answer to the second query is a quantity (called
force) which involves muscular strength (magnitude) and
direction (in which another player is positioned). Such
quantities are called vectors. In mathematics, physics and
engineering, we frequently come across with both types of

W.R. Hamilton
quantities, namely, scalar quantities such as length, mass,

(1805-1865)
time, distance, speed, area, volume, temperature, work,
money, voltage, density, resistance etc. and vector quantities like displacement, velocity,
acceleration,  force, weight, momentum, electric field intensity etc.

In this chapter, we will study some of the basic concepts about vectors, various
operations on vectors, and their algebraic and geometric properties. These two type of
properties, when considered together give a full realisation to the concept of vectors,
and lead to their vital applicability in various areas as mentioned above.

10.2  Some Basic Concepts

Let ‘l’ be any straight line in plane or three dimensional space. This line can be given
two directions by means of arrowheads. A line with one of these directions prescribed
is called a directed line (Fig 10.1 (i), (ii)).

Reprint 2025-26



VECTOR ALGEBRA 339

Fig 10.1

Now observe that if we restrict the line l to the line segment AB, then a magnitude
is prescribed on the line l with one of the two directions, so that we obtain a directed
line segment (Fig 10.1(iii)). Thus, a directed line segment has magnitude as well as
direction.

Definition 1 A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector.

Notice that a directed line segment is a vector (Fig 10.1(iii)), denoted as  or

simply as , and read as ‘vector ’ or ‘vector ’.

The point A from where the vector  starts is called its initial point, and the
point B where it ends is called its terminal point. The distance between initial and
terminal points of a vector is called the magnitude (or length) of the vector, denoted as

| |, or | |, or a. The arrow indicates the direction of the vector.

ANote   Since the length is never negative, the notation | | < 0 has no meaning.

Position Vector
From Class XI, recall the three dimensional right handed rectangular coordinate system
(Fig 10.2(i)). Consider a point P in space, having coordinates (x, y, z) with respect to

the origin O(0, 0, 0). Then, the vector  having O and P as its initial and terminal
points, respectively, is called the position vector of the point P with respect

to O. Using distance formula (from Class XI), the magnitude of  (or ) is given by

| |= 2 2 2
x + y + z

In practice, the position vectors of points A, B, C, etc., with respect to the origin O

are denoted by , , , etc., respectively (Fig 10.2 (ii)).

Direction Cosines

Consider the position vector  of a point P(x, y, z) as in Fig 10.3. The angles α,
β, γ made by the vector  with the positive directions of x, y and z-axes respectively,
are called its direction angles. The cosine values of these angles, i.e., cos α, cosβ and
cos γ are called direction cosines of the vector , and usually denoted by l, m and n,
respectively. Z

OCP, we may write cos β =  and cos γ = . Thus, the coordinates of the point P may

r r
also be expressed as (lr, mr,nr).  The numbers lr, mr and nr, proportional to the direction
cosines are called as direction ratios of vector , and denoted as a, b and c, respectively.

ANote   One may note that l2 + m2 + n2 = 1 but a2 + b2 + c2 ≠ 1, in general.

10.3  Types of Vectors

Zero Vector A vector whose initial and terminal points coincide, is called a zero vector

(or null vector), and denoted as . Zero vector can not be assigned a definite direction

as it has zero magnitude. Or, alternatively otherwise, it may be regarded as having any

direction. The vectors  represent the zero vector,

Unit Vector A vector whose magnitude is unity (i.e., 1 unit) is called a unit vector. The

unit vector in the direction of a given vector  is denoted by â .

Coinitial Vectors Two or more vectors having the same initial point are called coinitial

vectors.

Collinear Vectors Two or more vectors are said to be collinear if they are parallel to

the same line, irrespective of their magnitudes and directions.

Equal Vectors Two vectors  are said to be equal, if they have the same

magnitude and direction regardless of the positions of their initial points, and written

as .

Negative of a Vector A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of a given vector

(say, ), but direction is opposite to that of it, is called negative of the given vector.

For example, vector  is negative of the vector , and written as  = – .

Remark The vectors defined above are such that any of them may be subject to its

parallel displacement without changing its magnitude and direction. Such vectors are

called free vectors. Throughout this chapter, we will be dealing with free vectors only.

Example 1 Represent graphically a displacement

of 40 km, 30° west of south.

Solution The vector  represents the required

displacement (Fig 10.4).

10.4  Addition of Vectors

A vector  simply means the displacement from a point
A to the point B. Now consider a situation that a girl
moves from A to B and then from B to C
(Fig 10.7). The net displacement made by the girl from

point A to the point C, is given by the vector  and
expressed as Fig 10.7

This is known as the triangle law of vector addition.

In general, if we have two vectors  and  (Fig 10.8 (i)), then to add them, they are
positioned so that the initial point of one coincides with the terminal point of the other

For example, in Fig 10.8 (ii), we have shifted vector  without changing its magnitude
and direction, so that it’s initial point coincides with the terminal point of . Then, the

vector  + , represented by the third side AC of the triangle ABC, gives us the sum (or

resultant) of the vectors  and  i.e., in triangle ABC (Fig 10.8 (ii)), we have

Now again, since , from the above equation, we have

This means that when the sides of a triangle are taken in order, it leads to zero
resultant as the initial and terminal points get coincided (Fig 10.8(iii)).

The vector  is said to represent the difference of .

Now, consider a boat in a river going from one bank of the river to the other in a
direction perpendicular to the flow of the river. Then, it is acted upon by two velocity
vectors–one is the velocity imparted to the boat by its engine and other one is the
velocity of the flow of river water. Under the simultaneous influence of these two
velocities, the boat in actual starts travelling with a different velocity. To have a precise
idea about the effective speed and direction
(i.e., the resultant velocity) of the boat, we have
the following law of vector addition.

If we have two vectors  represented

by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram

in magnitude and direction (Fig 10.9), then their

sum  is represented in magnitude and

direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram

through their common point. This is known as

the parallelogram law of vector addition.

addition are equivalent to each other.

Let  be a given vector and λ a scalar. Then the product of the vector  by the scalar

λ, denoted as λ , is called the multiplication of vector  by the scalar λ. Note that, λ
is also a vector, collinear to the vector . The vector λ  has the direction same (or

opposite) to that of vector  according as the value of λ is positive (or negative). Also,

the magnitude of vector λ  is |λ | times the magnitude of the vector , i.e.,

|λ | = | λ | | |

A geometric visualisation of multiplication of a vector by a scalar is given

in Fig 10.12.

When λ = –1, then λ = – , which is a vector having magnitude equal to the

magnitude of  and direction opposite to that of the direction of . The vector –  is

called the negative (or additive inverse) of vector  and we always have

respectively, and denoted by iˆ,  ˆj   and  kˆ , respectively

operation which we intend to discuss regarding vectors is their product. We may
recall that product of two numbers is a number, product of two matrices is again a

matrix. But in case of functions, we may multiply them in two ways, namely,
multiplication of two functions pointwise and composition of two functions. Similarly,

multiplication of two vectors is also defined in two ways, namely, scalar (or dot)
product where the result is a scalar, and vector (or cross) product where the

result is a vector. Based upon these two types of products for vectors, they have
found various applications in geometry, mechanics and engineering. In this section,

Solution Let  be a unit vector in XY-plane (Fig 10.28). Then, from the

Historical Note

The word vector has been derived from a Latin word vectus, which means
“to carry”. The germinal ideas of modern vector theory date from around 1800
when Caspar Wessel (1745-1818) and Jean Robert Argand (1768-1822) described
that how a complex number a + ib could be given a geometric interpretation with
the help of a directed line segment in a coordinate plane. William Rowen Hamilton
(1805-1865) an Irish mathematician was the first to use the term vector for a
directed line segment in his book Lectures on Quaternions (1853). Hamilton’s
method of quaternions (an ordered set of four real numbers given as:

a + biˆ + cˆj + dkˆ, iˆ, ˆj, kˆ  following certain algebraic rules) was a solution to the

problem of multiplying vectors in three dimensional space. Though, we must
mention here that in practice, the idea of vector concept and their addition was
known much earlier ever since the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a Greek
philosopher, and pupil of Plato (427-348 B.C.). That time it was supposed to be
known that the combined action of two or more forces could be seen by adding
them according to parallelogram law. The correct law for the composition of
forces, that forces add vectorially, had been discovered in the case of perpendicular
forces by Stevin-Simon (1548-1620). In 1586 A.D., he analysed the principle of
geometric addition of forces in his treatise DeBeghinselen der Weeghconst
(“Principles of the Art of Weighing”), which caused a major breakthrough in the
development of mechanics. But it took another 200 years for the general concept
of vectors to form.

In the 1880, Josaih Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), an American physicist and
mathematician, and Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925), an English engineer, created
what we now know as vector analysis, essentially by separating the real (scalar)

Reprint 2025-26



376  MATHEMATICS

part of quaternion from its imaginary (vector) part. In 1881 and 1884, Gibbs
printed a treatise entitled Element of Vector Analysis. This book gave a systematic
and concise account of vectors. However, much of the credit for demonstrating
the applications of vectors is due to the D. Heaviside and P.G. Tait (1831-1901)
who contributed significantly to this subject.

THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY

v The moving power of mathematical invention is not
reasoning but imagination. – A.DEMORGAN v

11.1  Introduction

In Class XI, while studying Analytical Geometry in two
dimensions, and the introduction to three dimensional
geometry, we confined to the Cartesian methods only. In
the previous chapter of this book, we have studied some
basic concepts of vectors. We will now use vector algebra
to three dimensional geometry. The purpose of this
approach to 3-dimensional geometry is that it makes the
study simple and elegant*.

In this chapter, we shall study the direction cosines
and direction ratios of a line joining two points and also
discuss about the equations of lines and planes in space
under different conditions, angle between two lines, two

Leonhard Euler
planes, a line and a plane, shortest distance between two

(1707-1783)
skew lines and distance of a point from a plane. Most of
the above results are obtained in vector form. Nevertheless, we shall also translate
these results in the Cartesian form which, at times, presents a more clear geometric
and analytic picture of the situation.

11.2  Direction Cosines and Direction Ratios of a Line
From Chapter 10, recall that if a directed line L passing through the origin makes
angles α, β and γ with x, y and z-axes, respectively, called direction angles, then cosine
of these angles, namely, cos α, cos β and cos γ are called direction cosines of the
directed line L.

If we reverse the direction of L, then the direction angles are replaced by their supplements,
i.e., ,  and . Thus, the signs of the direction cosines are reversed.

Note that a given line in space can be extended in two opposite directions and so it
has two sets of direction cosines. In order to have a unique set of direction cosines for
a given line in space, we must take the given line as a directed line. These unique
direction cosines are denoted by l, m and n.

Remark If the given line in space does not pass through the origin, then, in order to find
its direction cosines, we draw a line through the origin and parallel to the given line.
Now take one of the directed lines from the origin and find its direction cosines as two
parallel line have same set of direction cosines.

Any three numbers which are proportional to the direction cosines of a line are
called the direction ratios of the line. If l, m, n are direction cosines and a, b, c are
direction ratios of a line, then a = λl, b=λm and c = λn, for any nonzero λ ∈ R.

ANote   Some authors also call direction ratios as direction numbers.

Let a, b, c be direction ratios of a line and let l, m and n be the direction cosines
(d.c’s) of the line. Then

l m n

Therefore l = ak, m = bk, n = ck ... (1)

where, depending on the desired sign of k, either a positive or a negative sign is to be
taken for l, m and n.

For any line, if a, b, c are direction ratios of a line, then ka, kb, kc; k ≠ 0 is also a
set of direction ratios. So, any two sets of direction ratios of a line are also proportional.
Also, for any line there are infinitely many sets of direction ratios.

11.2.1  Direction cosines of a line passing through two points

Since one and only one line passes through two given points, we can determine the
direction cosines of a line passing through the given points P(x , y , z ) and Q(x , y , z )

as follows (Fig 11.2 (a)).

Let l, m, n be the direction cosines of the line PQ and let it makes angles α, β and  γ

Draw perpendiculars from P and Q to XY-plane to meet at R and S. Draw a

Example 4 Find the direction cosines of x, y and z-axis.

Solution The x-axis makes angles 0°, 90° and 90° respectively with x, y and z-axis.
Therefore, the direction cosines of x-axis are cos 0°, cos 90°, cos 90° i.e., 1,0,0.
Similarly, direction cosines of y-axis and z-axis are 0, 1, 0 and 0, 0, 1 respectively.

Example 5 Show that the points A (2, 3, – 4), B (1, – 2, 3) and C (3, 8, – 11) are

Solution Direction ratios of line joining A and B are

The direction ratios of line joining B and C are

It is clear that direction ratios of AB and BC are proportional, hence, AB is parallel
to BC. But point B is common to both AB and BC. Therefore, A, B, C are
collinear points.

11.5  Shortest Distance between Two Lines
If two lines in space intersect at a point,
then the shortest distance between them is
zero. Also, if two lines in space are parallel,
then the shortest distance between them
will be the perpendicular distance, i.e. the
length of the perpendicular drawn from a
point on one line onto the other line.

Further, in a space, there are lines which
are neither intersecting nor parallel. In fact,
such pair of lines are non coplanar and
are called skew lines. For example, let us
consider a room of size 1, 3, 2 units along Fig 11.5

x, y and z-axes respectively Fig 11.5.

The line GE that goes diagonally across the ceiling and the line DB passes through
one corner of the ceiling directly above A and goes diagonally down the wall. These
lines are skew because they are not parallel and also never meet.

By the shortest distance between two lines we mean the join of a point in one line
with one point on the other line so that the length of the segment so obtained is the
smallest.

For skew lines, the line of the shortest distance will be perpendicular to both
the lines.

LINEAR PROGRAMMING

vThe mathematical experience of the student is incomplete if he never had
the opportunity to solve a problem invented by himself. – G. POLYA v

12.1  Introduction

In earlier classes, we have discussed systems of linear
equations and their applications in day to day problems. In
Class XI, we have studied linear inequalities and systems
of linear inequalities in two variables and their solutions by
graphical method. Many applications in mathematics
involve systems of inequalities/equations. In this chapter,
we shall apply the systems of linear inequalities/equations
to solve some real life problems of the type as given below:

A furniture dealer deals in only two items–tables and
chairs. He has Rs 50,000 to invest and has storage space
of at most 60 pieces. A table costs Rs 2500 and a chair
Rs 500. He estimates that from the sale of one table, he
can make a profit of Rs 250 and that from the sale of one L. Kantorovich

chair a profit of Rs 75. He wants to know how many tables and chairs he should buy
from the available money so as to maximise his total profit, assuming that he can sell all
the items which he buys.

Such type of problems which seek to maximise (or, minimise) profit (or, cost) form
a general class of problems called optimisation problems. Thus, an optimisation
problem may involve finding maximum profit, minimum cost, or minimum use of
resources etc.

A special but a very important class of optimisation problems is linear programming
problem. The above stated optimisation problem is an example of linear programming
problem. Linear programming problems are of much interest because of their wide
applicability in industry, commerce, management science etc.

In this chapter, we shall study some linear programming problems and their solutions
by graphical method only, though there are many other methods also to solve such
problems.

12.2  Linear Programming Problem and its Mathematical Formulation

We begin our discussion with the above example of furniture dealer which will further
lead to a mathematical formulation of the problem in two variables. In this example, we
observe

(i) The dealer can invest his money in buying tables or chairs or combination thereof.
Further he would earn different profits by following different investment
strategies.

(ii) There are certain overriding conditions or constraints viz., his investment is
limited to a maximum of Rs 50,000 and so is his storage space which is for a
maximum of 60 pieces.

Suppose he decides to buy tables only and no chairs, so he can buy 50000 ÷ 2500,
i.e., 20 tables. His profit in this case will be Rs (250 × 20), i.e., Rs 5000.

Suppose he chooses to buy chairs only and no tables. With his capital of Rs 50,000,
he can buy 50000 ÷ 500, i.e. 100 chairs. But he can store only 60 pieces. Therefore, he
is forced to buy only 60 chairs which will give him a total profit of Rs (60 × 75), i.e.,
Rs 4500.

There are many other possibilities, for instance, he may choose to buy 10 tables
and 50 chairs, as he can store only 60 pieces. Total profit in this case would be
Rs (10 × 250 + 50 × 75), i.e., Rs 6250 and so on.

We, thus, find that the dealer can invest his money in different ways and he would
earn different profits by following different investment strategies.

Now the problem is : How should he invest his money in order to get maximum
profit? To answer this question, let us try to formulate the problem mathematically.

12.2.1 Mathematical formulation of the problem
Let x be the number of tables and y be the number of chairs that the dealer buys.
Obviously, x and y must be non-negative, i.e.,

x ≥ 0 ... (1)
 (Non-negative constraints)

y ≥ 0 ... (2)

The dealer is constrained by the maximum amount he can invest (Here it is
Rs 50,000) and by the maximum number of items he can store (Here it is 60).

Stated mathematically,

2500x + 500y ≤ 50000 (investment constraint)

or 5x + y ≤ 100 ... (3)

and x + y ≤ 60  (storage constraint) ... (4)

Reprint 2025-26



396 MATHEMATICS

The dealer wants to invest in such a way so as to maximise his profit, say, Z which
stated as a function of x and y is given by

Z = 250x + 75y (called objective function) ... (5)

Mathematically, the given problems now reduces to:

Maximise Z = 250x + 75y

subject to the constraints:

5x + y ≤ 100

x + y ≤ 60

x ≥ 0,  y ≥ 0

So, we have to maximise the linear function Z subject to certain conditions determined
by a set of linear inequalities with variables as non-negative. There are also some other
problems where we have to minimise a linear function subject to certain conditions
determined by a set of linear inequalities with variables as non-negative. Such problems
are called Linear Programming Problems.

Thus, a Linear Programming Problem is one that is concerned with finding the
optimal value (maximum or minimum value) of  a linear function (called objective
function) of several variables (say x and y), subject to the conditions that the variables
are non-negative and satisfy a set of linear inequalities (called linear constraints).
The term linear implies that all the mathematical relations used in the problem are
linear relations while the term programming refers to the method of determining a
particular programme or plan of action.

Before we proceed further, we now formally define some terms (which have been
used above) which we shall be using in the linear programming problems:

Objective function Linear function Z = ax + by, where a, b are constants, which has
to be maximised or minimized is called a linear objective function.

In the above example, Z = 250x + 75y is a linear objective function. Variables x and
y are called decision variables.

Constraints The linear inequalities or equations or restrictions on the variables of a
linear programming problem are called constraints. The conditions x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 are
called non-negative restrictions. In the above example, the set of inequalities (1) to (4)
are constraints.

Optimisation problem A problem which seeks to maximise or minimise a linear
function (say of two variables x and y) subject to certain constraints as determined by
a set of linear inequalities is called an optimisation problem. Linear programming
problems are special type of optimisation problems. The above problem of investing a

LINEAR PROGRAMMING         397

given sum by the dealer in purchasing chairs and tables is an example of an optimisation
problem as well as of a linear programming problem.

We will now discuss how to find solutions to a linear programming problem. In this
chapter, we will be concerned only with the graphical method.

12.2.2 Graphical method of solving linear programming problems
In Class XI, we have learnt how to graph a system of linear inequalities involving two
variables x and y and to find its solutions graphically. Let us refer to the problem of
investment in tables and chairs discussed in Section 12.2. We will now solve this problem
graphically.  Let us graph the constraints stated as linear inequalities:

5x + y ≤ 100 ... (1)

x + y ≤ 60 ... (2)

x ≥ 0 ... (3)

y ≥ 0 ... (4)

The graph of this system (shaded region) consists of the points common to all half
planes determined by the inequalities (1) to (4) (Fig 12.1). Each point in this region
represents a feasible choice open to the dealer for investing in tables and chairs. The
region, therefore, is called the feasible region for the problem. Every point of this
region is called a feasible solution to the problem. Thus, we have,

Feasible region The common region determined by all the constraints including
non-negative constraints x, y ≥ 0 of a linear programming problem is called the feasible
region (or solution region) for the problem. In Fig 12.1, the region OABC (shaded) is
the feasible region for the problem. The region other than feasible region is called an
infeasible region.

Feasible solutions Points within and on the
boundary of the feasible region represent
feasible solutions of the constraints. In
Fig 12.1, every point within and on the
boundary of the feasible region OABC
represents feasible solution to the problem.
For example, the point (10, 50) is a feasible
solution of the problem and so are the points
(0, 60), (20, 0) etc.

Any point outside the feasible region is
called an  infeasible solution. For example,
the point (25, 40) is an infeasible solution of
the problem.

398 MATHEMATICS

Optimal (feasible) solution: Any point in the feasible region that gives the optimal
value (maximum or minimum) of the objective function is called an optimal solution.

Now, we see that every point in the feasible region OABC satisfies all the constraints
as given in (1) to (4), and since there are infinitely many points, it is not evident how
we should go about finding a point that gives a maximum value of the objective function
Z = 250x + 75y. To handle this situation, we use the following theorems which are
fundamental in solving linear programming problems. The proofs of these theorems
are beyond the scope of the book.

Theorem 1 Let R be the feasible region (convex polygon) for a linear programming
problem and let Z = ax + by be the objective function. When Z has an optimal value
(maximum or minimum), where the variables x and y are subject to constraints described
by linear inequalities, this optimal value must occur at a corner point* (vertex) of the
feasible region.

Theorem 2 Let R be the feasible region for a linear programming problem, and let
Z = ax + by be the objective function. If R is bounded**, then the objective function
Z has both a maximum and a minimum value on R and each of these occurs at a
corner point (vertex) of R.

Remark If R is unbounded, then a maximum or a minimum value of the objective
function may not exist. However, if it exists, it must occur at a corner point of R.
(By Theorem 1).

In the above example, the corner points (vertices) of the bounded (feasible) region
are: O, A, B and C and it is easy to find their coordinates as (0, 0), (20, 0), (10, 50) and
(0, 60) respectively. Let us now compute the values of Z at these points.

We have

Vertex of the Corresponding value
Feasible Region of Z (in Rs)

O (0,0) 0
C (0,60) 4500
B (10,50) 6250 ← Maximum

A (20,0)  5000

* A corner point of a feasible region is a point in the region which is the intersection of two boundary lines.

** A feasible region of a system of linear inequalities is said to be bounded if it can be enclosed within a
circle. Otherwise, it is called unbounded. Unbounded means that the feasible region does extend
indefinitely in any direction.

LINEAR PROGRAMMING         399

We observe that the maximum profit to the dealer results from the investment
strategy (10, 50), i.e. buying 10 tables and 50 chairs.

This method of solving linear programming problem is referred as Corner Point
Method. The method comprises of the following steps:

1. Find the feasible region of the linear programming problem and determine its
corner points (vertices) either by inspection or by solving the two equations of
the lines intersecting at that point.

2. Evaluate the objective function Z = ax + by at each corner point. Let M and m,
respectively denote the largest and smallest values of these points.

3. (i) When the feasible region is bounded, M and m are the maximum and
minimum values of Z.

(ii) In case, the feasible region is unbounded, we have:

4. (a) M is the maximum value of Z, if the open half plane determined by
ax + by > M has no point in common with the feasible region. Otherwise, Z
has no maximum value.

(b) Similarly, m is the minimum value of Z, if the open half plane determined by
ax + by < m has no point in common with the feasible region. Otherwise, Z

has no minimum value.

We will now illustrate these steps of Corner Point Method by considering some

examples:

Example 1 Solve the following linear programming problem graphically:

Maximise Z = 4x + y ... (1)

subject to the constraints:

x + y ≤ 50 ... (2)

3x + y ≤ 90 ... (3)

x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 ... (4)

Solution The shaded region in Fig 12.2 is the feasible region determined by the system
of constraints (2) to (4). We observe that the feasible region OABC is bounded. So,
we now use Corner Point Method to determine the maximum value of Z.

The coordinates of the corner points O, A, B and C are (0, 0), (30, 0), (20, 30) and
(0, 50) respectively. Now we evaluate Z at each corner point.

Hence, maximum value of Z is 120 at the point (30, 0).

system of constraints (2) to (4), which is bounded. The coordinates of corner points

A, B and C are (0,5), (4,3) and (0,6) respectively. Now we evaluate Z  = 200x + 500y
at these points.

Hence, minimum value of Z is 2300 attained at the point (4, 3)

Example 3 Solve the following problem graphically:

Minimise and Maximise Z = 3x + 9y ... (1)

subject to the constraints: x + 3y ≤ 60 ... (2)

x + y ≥ 10 ... (3)

x ≤ y ... (4)

x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 ... (5)

Solution First of all, let us graph the feasible region of the system of linear inequalities
(2) to (5). The feasible region ABCD is shown in the Fig 12.4. Note that the region is
bounded. The coordinates of the corner points A, B, C and D are (0, 10), (5, 5), (15,15)
and (0, 20) respectively.

Fig 12.4

We now find the minimum and maximum value of Z. From the table, we find that
the minimum value of Z is 60 at the point B (5, 5) of the feasible region.

The maximum value of Z on the feasible region occurs at the two corner points
C (15, 15) and D (0, 20) and it is 180 in each case.

Remark Observe that in the above example, the  problem  has multiple optimal solutions
at the corner points C and D, i.e. the both points produce same maximum value 180. In
such cases, you can see that every point on the line segment CD joining the two corner
points C and D also give the same maximum value. Same is also true in the case if the
two points produce same minimum value.

Example 4 Determine graphically the minimum value of the objective function

Z = – 50x + 20y ... (1)
subject to the constraints:

2x – y ≥ – 5 ... (2)

3x + y ≥ 3 ... (3)

2x – 3y ≤ 12 ... (4)

x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 ... (5)

Solution First of all, let us graph the feasible region of the system of inequalities (2) to
(5). The feasible region (shaded) is shown in the Fig 12.5. Observe that the feasible
region is unbounded.

We now evaluate Z at the corner points.

Corner Point Z = – 50x + 20y

(0, 5) 100
(0, 3) 60
(1, 0) –50
(6, 0) – 300 ← smallest

Fig 12.5

From this table, we find that  – 300 is the smallest value of Z at the corner point
(6, 0). Can we say that minimum value of Z is – 300? Note that if the region would
have been bounded, this smallest value of Z is the minimum value of Z (Theorem 2).
But here we see that the feasible region is unbounded. Therefore, – 300 may or may
not be the minimum value of Z. To decide this issue, we graph the inequality

– 50x + 20y < – 300 (see Step 3(ii) of corner Point Method.)

i.e., – 5x + 2y < – 30

and check whether the resulting open half plane has points in common with feasible
region or not. If it has common points, then –300 will not be the minimum value of Z.
Otherwise, –300 will be the minimum value of Z.

As shown in the Fig 12.5, it has common points. Therefore, Z = –50 x + 20 y
has no minimum value subject to the given constraints.

In the above example, can you say whether z = – 50 x + 20 y has the maximum
value 100 at (0,5)? For this, check whether the graph of – 50 x + 20 y > 100 has points
in common with the feasible region. (Why?)

subject to the constraints:

x + y ≥ 8 ... (1)

3x + 5y ≤ 15 ... (2)

x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 ... (3)

Solution Let us graph the inequalities (1) to (3) (Fig 12.6). Is there any feasible region?
Why is so?

From Fig 12.6, you can see that
there is no point satisfying all the
constraints simultaneously. Thus, the
problem is having no feasible region and
hence no feasible solution.

Remarks From the examples which we
have discussed so far, we notice some
general features of linear programming
problems:

(i) The feasible region is always a
convex region.

Fig 12.6
(ii) The maximum (or minimum)

solution of the objective function occurs at the vertex (corner) of the feasible
region. If two corner points produce the same maximum (or minimum) value
of the objective function, then every point on the line segment joining these
points will also give the same maximum (or minimum) value.

Summary

® A linear programming problem is one that is concerned with finding the optimal
value (maximum or minimum) of a linear function of several variables (called
objective function) subject to the conditions that the variables are
non-negative and satisfy a set of linear inequalities (called linear constraints).
Variables are sometimes called decision variables and are non-negative.

Historical Note

In the World War II, when the war operations had to be planned to economise
expenditure, maximise damage to the enemy, linear programming problems
came to the forefront.

The first problem in linear programming was formulated in 1941 by the Russian
mathematician, L. Kantorovich and the American economist, F. L. Hitchcock,

both of whom worked at it independently of each other. This was the well
known transportation problem. In 1945, an English economist, G.Stigler,
described yet another linear programming problem – that of determining an
optimal diet.

In 1947, the American economist, G. B. Dantzig suggested an efficient method
known as the simplex method which is an iterative procedure to solve any
linear programming problem in a finite number of steps.

L. Katorovich and American mathematical economist, T. C. Koopmans were
awarded the nobel prize in the year 1975 in economics for their pioneering
work in linear programming. With the advent of computers and the necessary
softwares, it has become possible to apply linear programming model to
increasingly complex problems in many areas.

13.1  Introduction
In earlier Classes, we have studied the probability as a
measure of uncertainty of events in a random experiment.
We discussed the axiomatic approach formulated by
Russian Mathematician, A.N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987)
and treated probability as a function of outcomes of the
experiment. We have also established equivalence between
the axiomatic theory and the classical theory of probability
in case of equally likely outcomes. On the basis of this
relationship, we obtained probabilities of events associated
with discrete sample spaces. We have also studied the
addition rule of probability. In this chapter, we shall discuss
the important concept of conditional probability of an event
given that another event has occurred, which will be helpful
in understanding the Bayes' theorem, multiplication rule of Pierre de Fermat
probability and independence of events. We shall also learn (1601-1665)
an  important concept of  random variable and its probability
distribution and also the mean and variance of a probability  distribution. In the last
section of the chapter, we shall study an important discrete probability distribution
called  Binomial distribution. Throughout this chapter, we shall take up the experiments
having equally likely outcomes, unless stated otherwise.

13.2  Conditional Probability
Uptill now in probability, we have discussed the methods of finding the probability of
events. If we have two events from the same sample space, does the information
about the occurrence of one of the events affect the probability of the other event? Let
us try to answer this question by taking up a random experiment in which the outcomes
are equally likely to occur.

Consider the experiment of tossing three fair coins. The sample space of the
experiment is

S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}

PROBABILITY      407

Since the coins are fair, we can assign the probability    to each sample point. Let

8
E be the event ‘at least two heads appear’ and  F be the event ‘first coin shows tail’.
Then

E = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH}

and F = {THH, THT, TTH, TTT}

Therefore P(E) = P ({HHH}) + P ({HHT}) + P ({HTH}) + P ({THH})

= + + + =  (Why ?)

and P(F) = P ({THH}) + P ({THT}) + P ({TTH}) + P ({TTT})

1 1 1 1 1
= + + + =

8 8 8 8 2
Also E ∩ F = {THH}

1
with P(E ∩ F) = P({THH}) = 

8
Now, suppose we are given that the first coin shows tail, i.e. F occurs, then what is

the probability of occurrence of E? With the information of occurrence of F, we are
sure that the cases in which first coin does not result into a tail should not be considered
while finding the probability of E. This information reduces our sample space from the
set S to its subset F for the event E. In other words, the additional information really
amounts to telling us that the situation may be considered as being that of a new
random experiment for which the sample space consists of all those outcomes only
which are favourable to the occurrence of the event F.

Now, the sample point of F which is favourable to event E is THH.

Thus, Probability of E considering F as the sample space = ,

1
or Probability of E given that the event F has occurred =

This probability of the event E is called the conditional probability of E given

that F has already occurred, and is denoted by P (E|F).

Thus P(E|F) =

4
Note that the elements of F which favour the event E are the common elements of

E and F, i.e. the sample points of E ∩ F.

Thus, we can also write the conditional probability of E given that F has occurred as

Numberof elementaryeventsfavourable to E∩F
P(E|F) =

Numberof elementaryevents whicharefavourable to F

n (E ∩ F)
=

n (F)

Dividing the numerator and the denominator by total number of elementary events
of the sample space, we see that P(E|F) can also be written as

n(E ∩ F)

n(S) P(E ∩ F)
P(E|F) = = ... (1)

n(F) P(F)
n(S)

Note that (1) is valid only when P(F) ≠ 0 i.e., F ≠ φ (Why?)

Thus, we can define the conditional probability as follows :

Definition 1 If  E and F are two events associated with the same sample space of a
random experiment, the conditional probability of the event E given that F has occurred,
i.e. P (E|F) is given by

P(E ∩F)
P(E|F) =  provided P(F) ≠ 0

P(F)

13.2.1  Properties of conditional probability

Let E and F be events of a sample space S of an experiment, then we have
Property 1 P (S|F) = P(F|F) = 1

We know that

P(S∩F) P(F)
P(S|F) = = =1

P(F) P(F)

P(F∩F) P(F)
Also P(F|F) = = =1

P(F) P(F)

Thus P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1

Property 2 If A and B are any two events of a sample space S and F is an event
of S such that P(F) ≠ 0, then

P((A ∪ B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F) – P((A ∩ B)|F)

Reprint 2025-26



PROBABILITY      409

In particular, if A and B are disjoint events, then

P((A∪B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F)
We have

P[(A∪B) ∩F]
P((A ∪B)|F) =

P(F)

P[(A∩F) ∪ (B∩F)]
=

P(F)

(by distributive law of union of sets over  intersection)

P(A∩F)+ P(B∩F) – P(A∩B ∩ F)

P(F)

P(A∩F) P(B∩F) P[(A∩B) ∩ F]
= + −

P(F) P(F) P(F)

= P(A|F) + P (B|F) – P ((A ∩B)|F)

When A and B are disjoint events, then

P((A ∩ B)|F) = 0

⇒ P((A ∪ B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F)

Property 3 P (E′|F) = 1 − P (E|F)

From Property 1, we know that P(S|F) = 1

⇒ P(E ∪ E′|F) = 1    since  S = E ∪ E′
⇒ P(E|F) + P (E′|F) = 1     since E and E′ are disjoint events

Thus, P (E′|F) = 1 − P (E|F)

Let us now take up some examples.

For the conditional probability discussed above, we have considered the elemen-
tary events of the experiment to be equally likely and the corresponding definition of
the probability of an event was used. However, the same definition can also be used in
the general case where the elementary events of the sample space are not equally
likely, the probabilities P (E ∩F) and P (F) being calculated accordingly. Let us take up
the following example.

Example 7 Consider the experiment of tossing a coin. If the coin shows head, toss it
again but if it shows tail, then throw a die.  Find the
conditional probability of the event that ‘the die shows
a number greater than 4’ given that ‘there is at least
one tail’.

Solution The outcomes of the experiment can be
represented in following diagrammatic manner called
the ‘tree diagram’.

The sample space of the experiment may be

described as

S = {(H,H), (H,T), (T,1), (T,2), (T,3), (T,4), (T,5), (T,6)}

where (H, H) denotes that both the tosses result into
head and (T, i) denote the first toss result into a tail and
the number i appeared on the die for i = 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Thus, the probabilities assigned to the 8 elementary
events

13.3  Multiplication Theorem on Probability

Let E and F be two events associated with a sample space S. Clearly, the set E ∩ F
denotes the event that both E and F have occurred. In other words, E ∩ F denotes the
simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F. The event E ∩ F is also written as EF.

Very often we need to find the probability of  the event EF. For example, in the
experiment of drawing two cards one after the other, we may be interested in finding
the probability of the event ‘a king and a queen’. The probability of event EF is obtained
by using the conditional probability as obtained below :

We know that the conditional probability of event E given that F has occurred is
denoted by P(E|F) and is given by

P(E ∩F)
P(E|F) = ,P (F)≠0

P(F)

From this result, we can write
P (E ∩ F) = P(F) . P (E|F) ... (1)

Also, we know that

P(F ∩E)
P(F|E) = ,P (E)≠0

P(E)

P(E ∩F)
or P(F|E) =  (since E ∩ F = F ∩ E)

P(E)

Thus, P(E ∩ F) = P(E). P(F|E) .... (2)

Combining (1) and (2), we find that

P (E ∩ F) = P(E) P(F|E)

= P(F) P(E|F) provided P(E) ≠ 0 and P(F) ≠ 0.

The above result is known as the multiplication rule of probability.

Let us now take up an example.

Example 8  An urn contains 10 black and 5 white balls. Two balls are drawn from the
urn one after the other without replacement. What is the probability that both drawn
balls are black?

Solution Let E and F denote respectively the events that first and second ball drawn
are black. We have to find P (E ∩ F) or P (EF).

Reprint 2025-26



 416 MATHEMATICS

10
Now P(E) = P (black ball in first draw) = 

15

Also given that the first ball drawn is black, i.e., event E has occurred, now there
are 9 black balls and five white balls left in the urn. Therefore, the probability that the
second ball drawn is black, given that the ball in the first draw is black, is nothing but
the conditional probability of F given that E has occurred.

i.e. P(F|E) =

By multiplication rule of probability, we have

P (E ∩ F) = P(E) P (F|E)

Multiplication rule of probability for more than two events If E, F and G are
three events of sample space, we have

P(E ∩ F ∩ G) = P (E) P (F|E) P (G|(E ∩ F)) = P (E) P (F|E) P (G|EF)

Similarly, the multiplication rule of probability can be extended for four or
more events.

The following example illustrates the extension of multiplication rule of probability
for three events.

Example 9 Three cards are drawn successively, without replacement from a pack of
52 well shuffled cards. What is the probability that first two cards are kings and the
third card drawn is an ace?

Solution Let K denote the event that the card drawn is king and A be the event that
the card drawn is an ace. Clearly, we have to find P (KKA)

4
Now P(K) =

52

Also, P (K|K) is the probability of second king with the condition that one king has

already been drawn. Now there are three kings in (52 − 1) = 51 cards.

3
Therefore P(K|K) =

51

Lastly, P(A|KK) is the probability of third drawn card to be an ace, with the condition
that two kings have already been drawn. Now there are four aces in left 50 cards.

13.4  Independent Events

Consider the experiment of drawing a card from a deck of 52 playing cards, in which
the elementary events are assumed to be equally likely. If E and F denote the events
'the card drawn is a spade' and 'the card drawn is an ace' respectively, then

13 1 4 1
P(E) = = and P(F) = =

52 4 52 13
Also E and F is the event ' the card drawn is the ace of spades' so that

P(E ∩F) 52 1

Hence P(E|F) = = =
P(F) 1 4

Since P(E) = = P (E|F), we can say that the occurrence of event F has not

4
affected the probability of occurrence of the event E.

We also have

1
P(E ∩F) 52 1

P(F|E) = = = = P(F)
P(E) 1 13

4

1
Again,  P (F) =  = P (F|E) shows that occurrence of event E has not affected

13
the probability of occurrence of the event F.

Thus, E and F are two events such that the probability of occurrence of one of
them is not affected by occurrence of the other.

Such events are called independent events.

 418 MATHEMATICS

Definition 2 Two events E and F are said to be independent, if

P (F|E) = P (F)  provided P (E)  ≠ 0

and P (E|F) = P (E)  provided P (F)  ≠ 0

Thus, in this definition we need to have P (E) ≠ 0 and  P(F) ≠ 0

Now, by the multiplication rule of probability, we have

P(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P (F|E) ... (1)

If E and F are independent, then (1) becomes

P(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P(F) ... (2)

Thus, using (2), the independence of two events is also defined as follows:

Definition 3 Let E and F be two events associated with the same random experiment,
then E and F are said to be independent if

P (E ∩ F) = P(E) . P (F)

Remarks

(i) Two events E and F are said to be dependent if they are not independent, i.e. if

P(E ∩ F ) ≠ P (E) . P (F)

(ii) Sometimes there is a confusion between independent events and mutually
exclusive events. Term ‘independent’ is defined in terms of ‘probability of events’
whereas mutually exclusive is defined in term of events (subset of sample space).
Moreover, mutually exclusive events never have an outcome common, but
independent events, may have common outcome. Clearly, ‘independent’ and
‘mutually exclusive’ do not have the same meaning.

In other words, two independent events having nonzero probabilities of occurrence
can not be mutually exclusive, and conversely, i.e. two mutually exclusive events
having nonzero probabilities of occurrence can not be independent.

(iii) Two experiments are said to be independent if for every pair of events E and F,
where E is associated with the first experiment and F with the second experiment,
the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F when the
two experiments are performed is the product of P(E) and P(F) calculated
separately on the basis of two experiments, i.e., P (E ∩ F) = P (E) . P(F)

(iv) Three events A, B and C are said to be mutually independent, if

P (A ∩ B) = P(A) P (B)

P(A ∩ C) = P(A) P (C)

P (B ∩ C) = P(B) P(C)

and P(A ∩ B ∩ C) = P(A) P (B) P (C)

If at least one of the above is not true for three given events, we say that the
events are not independent.

Example 10 A die is thrown. If E is the event ‘the number appearing is a multiple of
3’ and F be the event ‘the number appearing is even’ then find whether E and F are
independent ?

Solution We know that the sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Now E = { 3, 6}, F = { 2, 4, 6} and  E ∩ F = {6}

of the events A and B.

(E,G) and (F,G), which are independent? which are dependent?

13.5  Bayes' Theorem
Consider that there are two bags I and II. Bag I contains 2 white and 3 red balls and
Bag II contains 4 white and 5 red balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the

1
bags. We can find the probability of selecting any of the bags (i.e. ) or probability of

2
drawing a ball of a particular colour (say white) from a particular bag (say Bag I). In
other words, we can find the probability that the ball drawn is of a particular colour, if
we are given the bag from which the ball is drawn. But, can we find the probability that
the ball drawn is from a particular bag (say Bag II), if the colour of the ball drawn is
given? Here, we have to find the reverse probability of Bag II to be selected when an
event occurred after it is known. Famous mathematician, John Bayes' solved the problem
of finding reverse probability by using conditional probability. The formula developed
by him is known as ‘Bayes theorem’ which was published posthumously in 1763.
Before stating and proving the Bayes' theorem, let us first take up a definition and
some preliminary results.

13.5.1 Partition of a sample space

A set of events E , E , ..., E  is said to represent a partition of the sample space S if

(c) P(E ) > 0 for all i = 1, 2, ..., n.
i   

In other words, the events E , E , ..., E  represent a partition of the sample space
1 2 n

S if they are pairwise disjoint, exhaustive and have nonzero probabilities.

As an example, we see that any nonempty event E and its complement E′ form a
partition of the sample space S since they satisfy E ∩ E′ = φ and E ∪ E′ = S.

From the Venn diagram in Fig 13.3, one can easily observe that if E and F are any
two events associated with a sample space S, then the set  {E ∩ F′, E ∩ F, E′ ∩ F, E′ ∩ F′}
is a partition of the sample space S. It may be mentioned that the partition of a sample
space is not unique. There can be several partitions of the same sample space.

We shall now prove a theorem known as Theorem of total probability.

13.5.2  Theorem of total probability

Let   {E , E ,...,E }  be a partition of the sample space S,  and suppose that each of the
1 2 n

events E , E ,..., E  has nonzero probability of occurrence. Let A be any event associated
1 2 n

with S, then

P(A) = P(E ) P(A|E ) + P(E ) P(A|E ) + ... + P(E ) P(A|E )

Proof  Given that E , E ,..., E  is a partition of the sample space S (Fig 13.4). Therefore,

S = E  ∪ E ∪ ... ∪ E  ... (1)
1 2 n

and E  ∩ E  = φ, i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, ..., n
i j

Now, we know that for any event A,

A = A ∩ S
= A ∩ (E  ∪ E  ∪ ... ∪ E )

1 2 n

= (A ∩ E ) ∪ (A ∩ E ) ∪ ...∪ (A ∩ E ) Fig 13.4
1 2 n

Also A ∩ E  and A ∩ E  are respectively the subsets of E  and E . We know that
i j i j

E  and E  are disjoint, for i ≠ j , therefore, A  ∩ E  and A  ∩ E   are also disjoint for all
i j i j

i ≠ j,  i, j = 1, 2, ..., n.

Thus, P(A) = P [(A ∩ E ) ∪ (A ∩ E )∪ .....∪ (A ∩ E )]
1 2 n

= P (A ∩ E ) + P (A ∩ E ) + ... + P (A ∩ E )

Example 15 A person has undertaken a construction job. The probabilities are 0.65
that there will be strike, 0.80 that the construction job will be completed on time if there
is no strike, and 0.32 that the construction job will be completed on time if there is a
strike. Determine the probability that the construction job will be completed on time.

Solution Let A be the event that the construction job will be completed on time, and B
be the event that there will be a strike. We have to find P(A).
We have

P(B) = 0.65, P(no strike) = P(B′) = 1 − P(B) = 1 − 0.65 = 0.35

P(A|B) = 0.32, P(A|B′) = 0.80

Since events B and B′ form a partition of the sample space S, therefore, by theorem
on total probability, we have

P(A) = P(B) P(A|B) + P(B′) P(A|B′)
         = 0.65 × 0.32 + 0.35 × 0.8

         = 0.208 + 0.28 = 0.488

Thus, the probability that the construction job will be completed in time is 0.488.

We shall now state and prove the Bayes' theorem.

Bayes’ Theorem If E , E  ,..., E  are n non empty events which constitute a partition

Remark  The following terminology is generally used when Bayes' theorem is applied.

The events E , E , ..., E  are  called hypotheses.
1 2 n

The probability P(E ) is called the priori probability of the hypothesis E
i i

The conditional probability P(E |A) is called a posteriori probability of the

hypothesis E .
i

Bayes' theorem is also called the formula for the probability of "causes". Since the
E 's are a partition of the sample space S, one and only one of the events E  occurs (i.e.

i i

one of the events E  must occur and only one can occur). Hence, the above formula
i

gives us the probability of a particular E  (i.e. a "Cause"), given that the event A has
i

occurred.

The Bayes'  theorem has its applications in variety of situations, few of which are
illustrated in following examples.

Example 16 Bag I contains 3 red and 4 black balls while another Bag II contains 5 red
and 6 black balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the bags and it is found to
be red. Find the probability that it was drawn from Bag II.

HIV+ive. What is the probability that the person actually has HIV?

Solution Let E denote the event that the person selected is actually having HIV and A
the event that the person's HIV test is diagnosed as +ive. We need to find P(E|A).

Also E′ denotes the event that the person selected is actually not having HIV.

Clearly, {E, E′} is a partition of the sample space of all people in the population.

If X denotes the number of heads obtained, then X is a random variable and for
each outcome, its value is as given below :

More than  one random variables can be defined on the same sample space. For

of the above sample space S.

Then Y(HH) = 2, Y (HT) = 0, Y (TH) = 0, Y (TT) = – 2.

Thus, X and Y are two different random variables defined on the same sample

Historical Note

The earliest indication on measurement of chances in game of dice appeared
in 1477 in a commentary on Dante's Divine Comedy. A treatise on gambling
named liber de Ludo Alcae, by Geronimo Carden (1501-1576) was published
posthumously in 1663. In this treatise, he gives the number of favourable cases
for each event when two dice are thrown.

Galileo (1564-1642) gave casual remarks concerning the correct evaluation
of chance in a game of three dice. Galileo analysed that when three dice are
thrown, the sum of the number that appear is more likely to be 10 than the sum 9,
because the number of cases favourable to 10 are more than the number of
cases for the appearance of number 9.

Apart from these early contributions, it is generally acknowledged that the
true origin of the science of probability lies in the correspondence between two
great men of the seventeenth century, Pascal (1623-1662) and Pierre de Fermat
(1601-1665). A French gambler, Chevalier de Metre asked Pascal to explain
some seeming contradiction between his theoretical reasoning and the
observation gathered from gambling. In a series of letters written around 1654,
Pascal and Fermat laid the first foundation of science of probability. Pascal solved
the problem in algebraic manner while Fermat used the method of combinations.

Great Dutch Scientist, Huygens (1629-1695), became acquainted with the
content of the correspondence between Pascal and Fermat and published a first
book on probability, "De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae" containing solution of many
interesting rather than difficult problems on probability in games of chances.

The next great work on probability theory is by Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705),
in the form of a great book, "Ars Conjectendi" published posthumously in 1713
by his nephew, Nicholes Bernoulli. To him is due the discovery of one of the most
important probability distribution known as Binomial distribution. The next
remarkable work on probability lies in 1993. A. N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987) is
credited with the axiomatic theory of probability. His book, ‘Foundations of
probability’ published in 1933, introduces probability as a set function and is
considered a ‘classic!’.
