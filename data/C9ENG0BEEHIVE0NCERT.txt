FOREWORD

THE National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This
principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which
continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home
and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF
signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to
discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between
different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly
further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in
the National Policy of Education (1986).

##1##
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning
and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.  We must recognise that,
given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging
with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed
textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other
resources and sites of learning are ignored.  Inculcating creativity and
initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in
learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of
functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in
implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching
days are actually devoted to teaching.  The methods used for teaching and
evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making
children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress
or boredom.  Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of
curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different
stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving
higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering,
discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.

##2##
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
responsible for this book.  We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory
group in languages, Professor Namwar Singh and the Chief Advisor for
this book, Professor R. Amritavalli for guiding the work of this committee.
Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are

grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to
the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to
draw upon their resources, materials and personnel. We are especially
grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed
by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human
Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri
and Professor G.P. Deshpande for their valuable time and contribution.
As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous
improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments
and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision
and refinements.

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOKS

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on

students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing

the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with

creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the

exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes

already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into

consideration in this exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:

• Content based on genres of literature in the textbooks and

supplementary readers at different stages of school education

• Content that is meant for achieving Learning Outcomes for developing

language proficiency and is accessible at different stages

• For reducing the curriculum load and examination stress in view of

the prevailing condition of the Pandemic

• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much

interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through

self-learning or peer-learning

• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes

given above.

Notes for the Teacher

Beehive, a textbook in English for Class IX, is based on the new syllabus in
English which was prepared as a follow-up to the National Curriculum
Framework, 2005. The curriculum calls for an approach that is rich in
comprehensible input and adopts a language-across-the-curriculum,
multilingual perspective. This reader aims at helping the child to read for
meaning, and to learn to communicate in English with confidence and
accuracy.

Care has been taken to give a central place to the learner in the process
of teaching and learning. Learner-friendly language has been used in
the instructions, and the exercises and activities are addressed to the
child. In this process the teacher is a facilitator or a co-learner.

A rich variety of reading material has been provided to include the literary,
cultural and sociological dimensions of texts. The themes range from
childhood and adolescence, to disability, talent and achievement, to
music, science, and contemporary social and environmental concerns.
##17##
The range is as inclusive as possible, keeping in view the interest and
cognitive development of the learners. The book draws on different genres
such as story, biography and autobiography; science fiction; humour;
travelogue; and the one-act play.

##18##
The number of poems has been increased to help learners explore this
great source of language, derive the joy of learning through poetry, and
understand the music of words. An attempt has been made to include
different types of poems such as the lyric, the ballad and the humorous
poem.

##19##
The poems have been chosen for their simplicity and suitability in terms
of language and thought. We need not talk about the poet or the
background to the poem, unless the poem seems to demand it.  Nor
should we attempt to exhaust all the possibilities of a poem; we should
encourage the students to begin to see some of the possibilities. They
should be guided to apprehend the poem through the visual, the auditory,
the tactile, the intellectual, or the emotional channels, and to understand
the suggestiveness of the images.

An attempt has been made to help the learner develop the skill of
predicting and anticipating what follows. Every good reader should guess
what is coming next. The task ‘Before You Read’ given at the beginning

Reprint 2025-26



of each unit is designed for this purpose. Learners should be encouraged
to participate in this activity.

##20##
The section ‘Thinking about the Text’ attempts to move from surface
level understanding of the text to critical thinking. The comprehension
exercises given here try to help the learners infer meaning. There are a
few questions which ask for the readers’ judgment; they aim to  bring
out the learners’ deeper understanding of the text.

In the section ‘Thinking about Language’:

• Vocabulary enrichment has been attempted through a variety of
tasks on the usage of words closely related in meaning, matching
words to meanings, word building (including phrasal verbs), and
reference to the dictionary. An activity on the use of the index has
been included.

• Attention has been drawn to grammar-in-context that emerges out of
the reading text, e.g. the use of the tenses and voice, reported speech,
conditional and subordinate clauses or phrases, and adverbs.

##21##
The communicative skills have been exercised by tasks on Speaking
and Writing. The Speaking tasks call for learners to work in pairs or
groups, (for example) to present an argument, express a viewpoint,
express contrasts, seek or give an opinion, introduce a speaker, tell a
story, enact or read out a play in parts, etc.

There are a variety of writing tasks: help writing newspaper report, an
article for a school magazine, argumentative writing, narration,
description, and picture interpretation.

A small attempt has been made to relate speech and writing by pointing
out similarities and differences. Opportunities for writing in groups and
pairs are provided to get into the task.

We have introduced the old exercise of dictation again but from a
completely different perspective. Dictation has been introduced in its
current, updated form as a variety of activities designed to integrate the
language skills of listening, prior reading, language processing and recall,
and writing, including the appropriate use of punctuation in meaningful
contexts.

Some exercises also allow scope for the learners’ languages to support
one another’s by asking for reflection on relevant words, or poems or
stories in other languages; and attempt (preliminary as they may be) to
attend to the process of translation. Activities have been suggested to
bring out the relatedness of the learners’ school subjects.

Units 1–3

##22##
1. THE FUN THEY HAD

This story takes us to the world of the future where computers will play
a major role. Let the children talk freely about how they imagine the
schools of the future that their own children might go to. You might want
to explain the ideas of ‘virtual reality’ and ‘virtual classroom’. The term
‘virtual reality’ refers to a reality created by computer software, and a
‘virtual classroom’ is not a real classroom but one where learning is
through computer software or the Internet. The children may know what
a robot is, and be able to guess what a robotic teacher would be.

In this unit students are required to present their arguments in a debate.
##23##
The following points could be explained before the task.

• A debate is a contest between two speakers or two groups of speakers
to show skill and ability in arguing.

• A proposition, a question or a problem is required for this purpose,
which can be spoken for or against.

• To participate in a debate, one must prepare for it.  So, one must
prepare an outline of the main points in the order in which one is
going to argue.

• The time limit is about four to five minutes.

• The speaker addresses the audience.

• Every topic/subject has its own vocabulary.  These must be learnt.

• The speaker addresses the chair (Mr President/Madam), ‘submits’
an argument, ‘appeals’ for sympathetic understanding and support,
‘questions’ the opponent’s views, and ‘concludes’ an argument.

##24##
2. THE SOUND OF MUSIC

These biographical pieces tell us of people who have achieved success
and recognition through determination, hard work and courage. The
children may be asked to think of potential barriers to success, and of
people who have overcome them. The second part of the unit encourages
students to think about the rich heritage of Indian music, and our musical
instruments. The portraits of musicians given in the beginning may be
supplemented by others that the children can be asked to bring to class.

A comprehension exercise in Part II encourages children to find words in
the text that express attitudes (positive, negative or neutral) to events,
places, etc. Encourage the children to compare and discuss their answers.

Dictionary entries give us different kinds of information about words. Children
need help in using the dictionary to find specific kinds of information.

Notes for the Teacher / 3

Reprint 2025-26



This unit has an exercise that asks students to consult a dictionary and
find out which adjective can be used before a noun, which can be used
after a verb, and which can be used in both ways. You may add some
adjectives to those suggested. Encourage the children also to find more
adjectives of the kinds mentioned. Students may wish to consult (in
addition to the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary), the Longman
Dictionary of Contemporary English, the Collins Cobuild Advanced Learner’s
English Dictionary, and the Word Master (Orient Longman), or any good
dictionary of their choice.

##25##
The Speaking exercise asks the students to imagine introducing a
celebrity guest to an audience. It can be made an authentic activity if
students are given a couple of minutes during the morning assembly to
speak to their fellow-pupils about such a person. This would give them
practice in facing an audience, and encourage them to prepare seriously,
by: (i)  noting down the important points about the person to be
introduced, (ii) using appropriate phrases to introduce the person
(students should be allowed to think what phrases they want to use).

##26##
The Writing Task is an exercise in comparison. Hard work is a trait common
to Evelyn Glennie (Part I, para 5) and Bismillah Khan (Part II, para 5).
Help children identify the paragraphs that tell us about the two musicians’
goals. After they read and understand these parts of the text, they can
organise the ideas in two paragraphs, one on each musician.

##27##
3. THE LITTLE GIRL

##28##
The aim in this unit is to first read through the story at one go, not worrying
about difficult words or difficult language. Students can read the story for
homework and come to class; or the teacher can read out the story in
class; or the students can read out parts of the story in the class, one
after the other. Let them retell the story again, if necessary, in parts.

##29##
The dictionary exercise in this unit shows how a very small common
word can be used in different ways. Students might be interested in
thinking about how they use words in their own language to express
these meanings. They may also think of other words like same, small,
give and take to convey different kids of meaning. Encourage them to
consult a dictionary.

This is a story about the changing attitude of a girl child towards her
father. The Speaking and Writing exercises encourage the students to
think about the relationship between children and parents. The students
should be encouraged to say or write what they think, and not what the
teacher thinks they should say or write.  The aim is not to arrive at
a ‘correct’ answer, but to let every child voice an opinion and express
her/his ideas. It is hoped that children will find the topic of personal
relevance. This will help their ideas and language to flow freely.

1. MARGIE even wrote about it that night in her diary.
On the page headed 17 May 2157, she wrote, “Today
Tommy found a real book!”

It was a very old book. Margie’s grandfather once
said that when he was a little boy his grandfather

Reprint 2025-26



told him that there was a time when all stories
were printed on paper.

They turned the pages, which were yellow and
crinkly, and it was awfully funny to read words crinkly: with many

that stood still instead of moving the way they were folds or lines

supposed to — on a screen, you know. And then
when they turned back to the page before, it had
the same words on it that it had had when they
read it the first time.

##32##
2. “Gee,” said Tommy, “what a waste. When you’re
through with the book, you just throw it away, I
guess. Our television screen must have had a million
books on it and it’s good for plenty more. I wouldn’t
throw it away.”

“Same with mine,” said Margie. She was eleven
and hadn’t seen as many telebooks as Tommy had.
He was thirteen.

She said, “Where did you find it?”
“In my house.” He pointed without looking,

because he was busy reading. “In the attic.” attic: a space just

“What’s it about?” below the roof, used
as a storeroom

“School.”

about school? I hate school.” contemptuous;

Margie always hated school, but now she hated
something is

it more than ever. The mechanical teacher had been worthless
giving her test after test in geography and she had
been doing worse and worse until her mother had
shaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the County
Inspector.

##34##
4. He was a round little man with a red face and a
whole box of tools with dials and wires. He smiled
at Margie and gave her an apple, then took the
teacher apart. Margie had hoped he wouldn’t know
how to put it together again, but he knew how all
right, and, after an hour or so, there it was again,
large and black and ugly, with a big screen on which
all the lessons were shown and the questions were
asked. That wasn’t so bad. The part Margie hated

most was the slot where she had to put homework slot: a given space,

and test papers. She always had to write them out time or position

in a punch code they made her learn when she was
six years old, and the mechanical teacher calculated
the marks in no time.

##35##
5. The Inspector had smiled after he was finished and
patted Margie’s head. He said to her mother, “It’s
not the little girl’s fault, Mrs Jones. I think the
geography sector was geared a little too quick. Those geared  (to): adjusted

things happen sometimes. I’ve slowed it up to an to a particular
standard or level

average ten-year level. Actually, the overall pattern
of her progress is quite satisfactory.” And he patted
Margie’s head again.

Margie was disappointed. She had been hoping
they would take the teacher away altogether. They
had once taken Tommy’s teacher away for nearly a
month because the history sector had blanked out
completely.

So she said to Tommy, “Why would anyone write
about school?”

##36##
6. Tommy looked at her with very superior eyes.
“Because it’s not our kind of school, stupid. This is
the old kind of school that they had hundreds and
hundreds of years ago.” He added loftily, loftily: in a superior

pronouncing the word carefully, “Centuries ago.” way

Margie was hurt. “Well, I don’t know what
kind of school they had all that time ago.” She read
the book over his shoulder for a while, then said,
“Anyway, they had a teacher.”

They had a teacher... It was a man.

7. “A man isn’t smart enough.”

“Sure he is. My father knows as much as my
teacher.”

“He knows almost as much, I betcha.” betcha (informal):

Tommy screamed with laughter. “You don’t know

much, Margie. The teachers didn’t live in the
house. They had a special building and all the
kids went there.”

“And all the kids learned the same thing?”
“Sure, if they were the same age.”

8. “But my mother says a teacher has to be adjusted to
fit the mind of each boy and girl it teaches and that
each kid has to be taught differently.”

“Just the same they didn’t do it that way then.
##40##
If you don’t like it, you don’t have to read the book.”

“I didn’t say I didn’t like it,” Margie said quickly.
She wanted to read about those funny schools.

They weren’t even half finished when Margie’s
mother called, “Margie! School!”

Margie looked up. “Not yet, Mamma.”
“Now!” said Mrs Jones. “And it’s probably time

for Tommy, too.”
Margie said to Tommy, “Can I read the book some

more with you after school?”

The screen was lit up, and it said: “Today’s

fractions. Please insert yesterday’s homework in the
proper slot.”

10. Margie did so with a sigh. She was thinking about
the old schools they had when her grandfather’s
grandfather was a little boy. All the kids from the
whole neighborhood came, laughing and shouting
in the schoolyard, sitting together in the schoolroom,
going home together at the end of the day. They
learned the same things, so they could help one

Thinking about Language

I. Adverbs

Read this sentence taken from the story:

They had once taken Tommy’s teacher away for nearly a month because the
history sector had blanked out completely.

##67##
The word complete is an adjective. When you add –ly to it, it becomes an adverb.

##68##
1. Find the sentences in the lesson which have the adverbs given in the box
below.

awfully sorrowfully completely loftily

carefully differently quickly nonchalantly

##69##
2. Now use these adverbs to fill in the blanks in the sentences below.

(i) The report must be read  so that performance can be
improved.

(ii) At the interview, Sameer answered our questions ,
shrugging his shoulders.

(iii) We all behave  when we are tired or hungry.

(iv) The teacher shook her head  when Ravi lied to her.

(v) I  forgot about it.

(vi) When I complimented Revathi on her success, she just smiled
 and turned away.

(vii) The President of the Company is  busy and will not
be able to meet you.

(viii) I finished my work  so that I could go out to play.

Remember:

An adverb describes action. You can form adverbs by adding –ly to adjectives.

Spelling Note:  When an adjective ends in –y, the y changes to i when you
add –ly to form an adverb.

For example: angr-y → angr-i-ly

3. Make adverbs from these adjectives.

(i) angry (ii) happy

(iii) merry (iv) sleepy

(v) easy (vi) noisy

(vii) tidy (viii) gloomy

II. If Not and Unless

• Imagine that Margie’s mother told her, “You’ll feel awful if you don’t finish
your history lesson.”

• She could also say: “You’ll feel awful unless you finish your history lesson.”

Unless means if not. Sentences with unless or if not are negative conditional
sentences.

Notice that these sentences have two parts. The part that begins with if not or
unless tells us the condition. This part has a verb in the present tense (look at
the verbs don’t finish, finish in the sentences above).

##72##
The other part of the sentence tells us about a possible result. It tells us what
will happen (if something else doesn’t happen). The verb in this part of the
sentence is in the future tense (you’ll feel/you will feel ).

Notice these two tenses again in the following examples.

Future Tense Present Tense

• There won’t be any books left unless we preserve them.

• You won’t learn your lessons if you don’t study regularly.

• Tommy will have an accident unless he drives more slowly.

Complete the following conditional sentences. Use the correct form of the verb.

The Road Not Taken

This well-known poem is about making choices, and the
choices that shape us. Robert Frost is an American poet who
writes simply, but insightfully, about common, ordinary
experiences.

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveller, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same.

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence;
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I —
I took the one less travelled by,
And that has made all the difference.

Bux was employed to play the shehnai. Ali Bux would

the Ganga inspired him to improvise and invent raagas

6. At the age of 14, Bismillah accompanied his uncle
to the Allahabad Music Conference. At the end of
his recital, Ustad Faiyaz Khan patted the young
boy’s back and said, “Work hard and you shall make

Lucknow in 1938 came Bismillah’s big break. He
soon became an often-heard shehnai player on radio.

I. Imagine the famous singer Kishori Amonkar is going to visit your school. You
have been asked to introduce her to the audience before her performance. How
would you introduce her?

Here is some information about Kishori Amonkar you can find on the Internet.
Read the passage and make notes of the main points about:

• her parentage
• the school of music she belongs to
• her achievements
• her inspiration
• awards

Padma Bhushan Kishori Amonkar, widely considered the finest female
vocalist of her generation, was born in 1931, daughter of another great artist,
Smt. Mogubai Kurdikar. In her early years she absorbed the approach and
repertoire of her distinguished mother’s teacher Ustad Alladiya Khan. As her
own style developed, however, she moved away from Alladiya Khan’s ‘Jaipur-
Atrauli gharana’ style in some respects, and as a mature artist her approach
is usually regarded as an individual, if not unique, variant of the Jaipur
model.

Kishori Amonkar is a thinker, besotted by what she calls the mysterious
world of her raagas. She dissects them with the precision of a perfectionist,
almost like a scientist, until the most subtle of shades and emotions emerge
and re-emerge.

She is very much inspired by the teachings of the ancient Vedic sages,
written at a time when vocal music was highly devotional in character. This

soul searching quality of her music, coupled with a very intellectual approach
to raaga performance has gained her quite a following in India and has helped
to revive the study of khayal.

Significant awards bestowed on this artist include the Sangeet Natak
Akademi Award (1985), the Padma Bhushan (1987), and the highly coveted
Sangeet Samradhini Award (considered one of the most prestigious awards
in Indian Classical Music) in 1997.

II. Use your notes on Kishori Amonkar to introduce her to an imaginary audience.
You may use one of the following phrases to introduce a guest:

I am honoured to introduce.../I feel privileged to introduce.../We welcome you...

Writing
“If you work hard and know where you’re going, you’ll get there,” says Evelyn
Glennie.

You have now read about two musicians, Evelyn Glennie and Ustad Bismillah

Answer these questions in two paragraphs, one on each of the two musicians.

Wind

##162##
The wind blows strongly and causes a lot of destruction.
How can we make friends with it?

##163##
Wind, come softly.
Don’t break the shutters of the windows.
Don’t scatter the papers.
Don’t throw down the books on the shelf.
There, look what you did — you threw them all down.
You tore the pages of the books.
You brought rain again.
You’re very clever at poking fun at weaklings.
Frail crumbling houses, crumbling doors, crumbling rafters,
crumbling wood, crumbling bodies, crumbling lives,
crumbling hearts —
the wind god winnows and crushes them all.
He won’t do what you tell him.
So, come, let’s build strong homes,
Let’s joint the doors firmly.
Practise to firm the body.
Make the heart steadfast.
Do this, and the wind will be friends with us.
##164##
The wind blows out weak fires.
He makes strong fires roar and flourish.
His friendship is good.
We praise him every day.

3. The Little Girl

BEFORE YOU READ

• Do you feel you know your parents better now, than when
you were much younger? Perhaps you now understand the
reasons for some of their actions that used to upset you earlier.

• This story about a little girl whose feelings for her father
change from fear to understanding will probably find an echo
in every home.

1. TO the little girl he was a figure to be feared and a figure to be feared:

avoided. Every morning before going to work he came a person to be feared

into her room and gave her a casual kiss, to which
she responded with “Goodbye, Father”. And oh,
there was a glad sense of relief when she heard the
noise of the carriage growing fainter and fainter
down the long road!

In the evening when he came home she stood
near the staircase and heard his loud voice in the
hall. “Bring my tea into the drawing-room... Hasn’t
the paper come yet? Mother, go and see if my paper’s
out there — and bring me my slippers.”

2. “Kezia,” Mother would call to her, “if you’re a good
girl you can come down and take off father’s boots.”
Slowly the girl would slip down the stairs, more slip down: come

slowly still across the hall, and push open the down quietly and
unwillingly

By that time he had his spectacles on and looked

at her over them in a way that was terrifying to
the little girl.

“Well, Kezia, hurry up and pull off these boots
and take them outside. Have you been a good
girl today?”

“I d-d-don’t know, Father.”

“Don’t stare so, Kezia. You look like a little

Then Father came into the room with a ruler in
his hands.

“I am going to beat you for this,” he said.
“Oh, no, no”, she screamed, hiding under the

bedclothes.
He pulled them aside.
“Sit up,” he ordered, “and hold out your hands.

You must be taught once and for all not to touch
what does not belong to you.”

“But it was for your b-b-birthday.”
Down came the ruler on her little, pink palms.

in a shawl and rocked her in the rocking-chair, the
child clung to her soft body.

“What did God make fathers for?” she sobbed.
“Here’s a clean hanky, darling. Blow your nose.

Go to sleep, pet; you’ll forget all about it in the

have you ever listened to the patter of soft rain on the roof ?
What thoughts flashed through your mind as you heard this
melody of nature? Read the poem to find out what the poet
dreamed of while listening to the rain.

When the humid shadows hover
Over all the starry spheres
And the melancholy darkness
Gently weeps in rainy tears,
What a bliss to press the pillow
Of a cottage-chamber bed
And lie listening to the patter
Of the soft rain overhead!

Every tinkle on the shingles
Has an echo in the heart;
And a thousand dreamy fancies
Into busy being start,
And a thousand recollections
Weave their air-threads into woof,
As I listen to the patter
Of the rain upon the roof.

Now in memory comes my mother,
As she used in years agone,
To regard the darling dreamers
Ere she left them till the dawn:
O! I feel her fond look on me
As I list to this refrain
Which is played upon the shingles
By the patter of the rain.

4. A TRULY BEAUTIFUL MIND

##217##
The story of Einstein tries to show him as a human being, a fairly
ordinary person who had his likes and dislikes, his streaks of rebellion,
and his problems. The class can think about how a ‘great person’ was
perceived before being recognised as ‘great’: it is not as though great
people are born with a special sign that allows us to recognise them
instantly! What qualities in a person, then, make them a genius or a
great person?

You can take the help of a science teacher to explain Einstein’s Theory
of Relativity, to talk about Einstein, and build inter-subject cooperation.

##218##
The exercise of matching headings to paragraphs in the lesson is useful
for finding the topic sentence or to scan a paragraph for specific
information. Students may be asked to provide a different heading if
they feel some other point is equally important.

Students should be guided to write a newspaper report. Note the points
given below. Illustrate them by bringing examples from newspapers into
the class, and ask students to bring their own examples.

• A report should have:
##219##
1. A headline
##220##
2. Name of the reporter e.g. ‘By a Staff Reporter’, etc.
##221##
3. Place, date, source (the source may also be given at the end of the

report).

• The beginning is usually an expansion of the headline.  The middle
paragraph gives the details.  It is followed by the conclusion or the
summing up.

• The report should be brief, but the headline and the style should be
eye-catching.

• Sometimes important points are given in a box in the centre of the
report.

• Regarding the language of the reports:
##222##
1. passives for past action (for example: It is found ..., . . . has been

unearthed.)

##223##
2. present tense for statements (The document contains…, The
manuscript describes…)

This unit has a passage for dictation, an anecdote. Dictation is an
exercise that requires the individual participation of each student. It
fosters unconscious thinking, and draws attention to language form.
Students can also be given opportunities for self or peer correction after
the dictation.

• Students should first read the passage silently, noticing the use of
punctuation marks.

• The passage to be dictated should be read aloud twice in the class
with proper intonation, and pauses between meaningful phrases.

• The passage is read a third time for students to check through.

##224##
5. THE SNAKE AND THE MIRROR

‘The Snake and the Mirror’ is a complex story of self-discovery that is
humorously told. The narrator is a vain and foolish young man who in
a moment of crisis realises that he is “poor, foolish and stupid”. The
questions are designed to help the students notice the humour in the
narration.

This unit has a formal, expository passage for dictation. Students should
be encouraged to learn the spellings of unfamiliar words beforehand.
##225##
The dictation of such passages also encourages the development of
grammar in the students’ minds, as they recall complex language.

##226##
The Writing task is based on a sketch from a photograph that tells a
story. Encourage the students to read the words given alongside the
sketch. Let the students form pairs or groups to talk freely about the
sketch before they start writing.

A new kind of activity introduced in this lesson is to compare two
translations of the beginning of a story. This activity suggests to the
students that language is not ‘fixed’; there are different ways of
experiencing an idea, which also lead to small changes in the idea that
is expressed. This activity should be done as a fun activity.

##227##
6. MY CHILDHOOD

##228##
The autobiographical account of childhood embodies the themes of
harmony and prejudice, tradition and change. The questions guide the
children to identify the instances of the themes.

A map reading activity is given in this unit.  Students will find out the
geographical location of Dhanushkodi and Rameswaram, and
the languages spoken at that time by different communities. This

will develop a critical understanding of how life and society in
the deep south changed and developed over the years. Dhanuskodi
and Rameswaram are on an island, the Pamban Island, off the
Tamil Nadu coast.

##229##
The dictionary work encourages children to identify the contexts, literal
and metaphorical, in which the given words occur. You may find other
such words to add to the exercise.

##230##
The dictation exercise in this unit requires the rearrangement of jumbled
paragraphs. Ideally this kind of dictation should be carried out with
passages that the students have not seen before.

##231##
The teacher dictates the three parts of the given passage, in random
order, one to each group in class, for example part two first, then part
three, and finally part one. The class has to share information in order
to put the text together in the right order. This can be a class activity
directed by the teacher.

##232##
The Speaking exercise includes an activity requiring students to ask
other people for their opinion on the topic.

4. A Truly Beautiful Mind

BEFORE YOU READ

• Who do you think of, when you hear the word ‘genius’? Who
is a genius — what qualities do you think a genius has?

• We shall now read about a young German civil servant who
took the world by storm about a hundred years ago. In the
summer of 1905, the 26-year-old published in quick succession
four ground-breaking papers: about light, the motion of
particles, the electrodynamics of moving bodies, and energy.
His work took up only a few pages in scientific journals, but
changed forever our understanding of space, time and the
entire cosmos — and transformed the name ‘Einstein’ into a
synonym for genius.

• Fifty years after his death, Albert Einstein’s genius still reigns.

##234##
1. ALBERT Einstein was born on 14 March 1879 in the
German city of Ulm, without any indication that he
was destined for greatness.  On the contrary, his
mother thought Albert was a freak. To her, his head freak: a word used

seemed much too large. disapprovingly to talk

talking. When he finally did learn to speak, he uttered behave, look or think
everything twice. Einstein did not know what to do like others

with other children, and his playmates called him
“Brother Boring.” So the youngster played by himself

Otto Neugebauer, the historian of ancient mathematics, told a
story about the boy Einstein that he characterises as a “legend”,
but that seems fairly authentic. As he was a late talker, his parents
were worried. At last, at the supper table one night, he broke his
silence to say, “The soup is too hot.” Greatly relieved, his parents
asked why he had never said a word before. Albert replied,
“Because up to now everything was in order.”

toys. Looking at his newborn sister, Maja, he is said
to have said: “Fine, but where are her wheels?”

Einstein chose as a profession wouldn’t matter,
because “he’ll never make a success at anything.”
Einstein began learning to play the violin at the
age of six, because his mother wanted him to; he
later became a gifted amateur violinist, maintaining amateur: doing

4. But Albert Einstein was not a bad pupil.  He went
rather than as a

to high school in Munich, where Einstein’s family profession
had moved when he was 15 months old, and scored
good marks in almost every subject. Einstein hated
the school’s regimentation, and often clashed with regimentation: order

his teachers. At the age of 15, Einstein felt so stifled or discipline taken to
an extreme

there that he left the school for good.

Milan, and left their son with relatives.  After prolonged
discussion, Einstein got his wish to continue his

7. He also felt a special interest in a fellow student,
Mileva Maric, whom he found to be a “clever
creature.”  This young Serb had come to Switzerland
because the University in Zurich was one of the few
in Europe where women could get degrees. Einstein
saw in her an ally  against the “philistines”— ally: a friend or an

with whom he was constantly at odds. The couple philistines: a word

fell in love.  Letters survive in which they put their used disapprovingly

affection into words, mixing science with who do not like art,
tenderness. Wrote Einstein: “How happy and proud literature or music
I shall be when we both have brought our work on
relativity to a victorious conclusion.”

8. In 1900, at the age of 21, Albert Einstein was a
university graduate and unemployed. He worked
as a teaching assistant, gave private lessons and
finally secured a job in 1902 as a technical expert
in the patent office in Bern. While he was supposed patent: a document

to be assessing other people’s inventions, Einstein which gives the
rights of an invention

was actually developing his own ideas in secret. He to an inventor
is said to have jokingly called his desk drawer at
work the “bureau of theoretical physics.”

##243##
9. One of the famous papers of 1905 was Einstein’s
Special Theory of Relativity, according to which time
and distance are not absolute. Indeed, two perfectly absolute: measured

accurate clocks will not continue to show the same in itself, not in
relation to anything

time if they come together again after a journey if else
one of them has been moving very fast relative to
the other. From this followed the world’s most
famous formula which describes the relationship
between mass and energy:

E = mc2

(In this mathematical equation, E stands for energy, m for mass
and c for the speed of the light in a vacuum (about 300,000 km/s).

hours —that’s relativity. – ALBERT EINSTEIN

10. While Einstein was solving the most difficult
problems in physics, his private life was
unravelling. Albert had wanted to marry Mileva right unravelling: starting

after finishing his studies, but his mother was to fail

against it.  She thought Mileva, who was three years
older than her son, was too old for him. She was
also bothered by Mileva’s intelligence. “She is a
book like you,” his mother said. Einstein put the
wedding off.

##245##
11. The pair finally married in January 1903, and had
two sons.  But a few years later, the marriage
faltered. Mileva, meanwhile, was losing her faltered: became

intellectual ambition and becoming an unhappy weak

housewife.  After years of constant fighting, the
couple finally divorced in 1919.  Einstein married
his cousin Elsa the same year.

12.Einstein’s new personal chapter coincided with his
rise to world fame. In 1915, he had published his
General Theory of Relativity, which provided a new
interpretation of gravity.  An eclipse of the sun in
1919 brought proof that it was accurate. Einstein
had correctly calculated in advance the extent to
which the light from fixed stars would be deflected deflected: changed

through the sun’s gravitational field. The newspapers direction because it

15. At the urging of a colleague, Einstein wrote a letter
to the American President, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
on 2 August 1939, in which he warned: “A single
bomb of this type . . . exploded in a port, might very
well destroy the whole port together with some of
the surrounding territory.” His words did not fail to
have an effect.  The Americans developed the atomic

In 1931 Charlie Chaplin invited Albert Einstein, who was visiting Hollywood,
to a private screening of his new film, City Lights. As the two men drove into
town together, passersby waved and cheered. Chaplin turned to his guest and
explained: “The people are applauding you because none of them understands
you and applauding me because everybody understands me.”

One of Einstein’s colleagues asked him for his telephone number one
day. Einstein reached for a telephone directory and looked it up. “You don’t
remember your own number?” the man asked, startled.

“No,” Einstein answered. “Why should I memorise something I can so
easily get from a book?” (In fact, Einstein claimed never to memorise anything
which could be looked up in less than two minutes.)

The Lake Isle of Innisfree

This well known poem explores the poet’s longing for the peace
and tranquillity of Innisfree, a place where he spent a lot of
time as a boy. This poem is a lyric.

I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honeybee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;
There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
And evenings full of the linnet’s wings.

I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I hear the lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,
I hear it in the deep heart’s core.

WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS

GLOSSARY

wattles: twisted sticks for making fences, walls

glade: clearing; open space

linnet: a small brown and grey bird with a short beak

Thinking about the Poem

I. 1.What kind of place is Innisfree? Think about:
(i) the three things the poet wants to do when he goes back there (stanza I);
(ii) what he hears and sees there and its effect on him (stanza II);

(iii) what he hears in his “heart’s core” even when he is far away from
Innisfree (stanza III).

##278##
2. By now you may have concluded that Innisfree is a simple, natural place,
full of beauty and peace. How does the poet contrast it with where he now
stands? (Read stanza III.)

##279##
3. Do you think Innisfree is only a place, or a state of mind? Does the poet
actually miss the place of his boyhood days?

II. 1. Look at the words the poet uses to describe what he sees and hears at
Innisfree

(i) bee-loud glade

(ii) evenings full of the linnet’s wings

(iii) lake water lapping with low sounds

What pictures do these words create in your mind?

##280##
2. Look at these words;

... peace comes dropping slow
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings

What do these words mean to you? What do you think “comes dropping
slow...from the veils of the morning”? What does “to where the cricket sings”
mean?

Health is the greatest gift, contentment

the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best

relationship.

5. The Snake and the Mirror

BEFORE YOU READ

• Do you like to look at yourself in the mirror? What do you
think about at such times? Have you ever seen a dog, a cat
or a bird look into a mirror? What do you think it sees?

• Now read this humorous story about a doctor, a snake, and
a mirror.

##283##
1. “HAS a snake ever coiled itself round any part of
your body? A full-blooded cobra?” All of us fell silent.
##284##
The question came from the homeopath. The topic
came up when we were discussing snakes. We
listened attentively as the doctor continued with
his tale.

It was a hot summer night; about ten o’clock. I had
my meal at the restaurant and returned to my room.
I heard a noise from above as I opened the door.
##285##
The sound was a familiar one. One could say that
the rats and I shared the room. I took out my box of
matches and lighted the kerosene lamp on the table.

##286##
2. The house was not electrified; it was a small rented
room. I had just set up medical practice and my
earnings were meagre. I had about sixty rupees in meagre: small in

my suitcase. Along with some shirts and dhotis, I quantity.

also possessed one solitary black coat which I was
then wearing.

##287##
3. I took off my black coat, white shirt and not-so- gable

white vest and hung them up. I opened the two
windows in the room. It was an outer room with
one wall facing the open yard. It had a tiled roof

gable: upper part of
with long supporting gables that rested on the beam a wall below a
over the wall. There was no ceiling. There was a sloping roof

regular traffic of rats to and from the beam. I made
my bed and pulled it close to the wall. I lay down
but I could not sleep. I got up and went out to the
veranda for a little air, but the wind god seemed to
have taken time off.

##288##
4. I went back into the room and sat down on the
chair. I opened the box beneath the table and took
out a book, the Materia Medica. I opened it at the
table on which stood the lamp and a large mirror; a
small comb lay beside the mirror.
One feels tempted to look into a mirror when it is
near one. I took a look. In those days I was a great
admirer of beauty and I believed in making myself
look handsome. I was unmarried and I was a doctor.
I felt I had to make my presence felt. I picked up the
comb and ran it through my hair and adjusted the
parting so that it looked straight and neat.
Again I heard that sound from above.

##289##
5. I took a close look at my face in the mirror. I made
an important decision — I would shave daily and
grow a thin moustache to look more handsome. I
was after all a bachelor, and a doctor!
I looked into the mirror and smiled. It was an
attractive smile. I made another earth-shaking
decision. I would always keep that attractive smile
on my face . . . to look more handsome. I was after
all a bachelor, and a doctor too on top of it!
Again came that noise from above.

##290##
6. I got up, paced up and down the room. Then another
lovely thought struck me. I would marry.
I would get married to a woman doctor who had
plenty of money and a good medical practice. She
had to be fat; for a valid reason. If I made some silly
mistake and needed to run away she should not be
able to run after me and catch me!
With such thoughts in my mind I resumed my seat
in the chair in front of the table. There were no
more sounds from above. Suddenly there came a
dull thud as if a rubber tube had fallen to the

ground ... surely nothing to worry about. Even so I
thought I would turn around and take a look. No
sooner had I turned than a fat snake wriggled over
the back of the chair and landed on my shoulder.
##292##
The snake’s landing on me and my turning were
simultaneous.

##293##
7. I didn’t jump. I didn’t tremble. I didn’t cry out. There
was no time to do any such thing. The snake
slithered along my shoulder and coiled around my
left arm above the elbow. The hood was spread out
and its head was hardly three or four inches from
my face!
It would not be correct to say merely that I sat
there holding my breath. I was turned to stone. But
my mind was very active. The door opened into
darkness. The room was surrounded by darkness.
In the light of the lamp I sat there like a stone
image in the flesh.

##294##
8. I felt then the great presence of the creator of this
world and this universe. God was there. Suppose I
said something and he did not like it . . .
I tried in my imagination to write in bright letters
outside my little heart the words, ‘O God’.
There was some pain in my left arm. It was as if a
thick leaden rod — no, a rod made of molten fire —
was slowly but powerfully crushing my arm. The
arm was beginning to be drained of all strength.
What could I do?

##295##
9. At my slightest movement the snake would strike
me! Death lurked four inches away. Suppose it
struck, what was the medicine I had to take? There
were no medicines in the room. I was but a poor,
foolish and stupid doctor. I forgot my danger and
smiled feebly at myself.
It seemed as if God appreciated that. The snake
turned its head. It looked into the mirror and saw
its reflection. I do not claim that it was the first
snake that had ever looked into a mirror. But it
was certain that the snake was looking into the
mirror. Was it admiring its own beauty? Was it trying

Reprint 2025-26



Perhaps it wanted to enjoy its
reflection at closer quarters.

to make an important decision about growing a
moustache or using eye shadow and mascara or
wearing a vermilion spot on its forehead?

##296##
10. I did not know anything for certain. What sex was
this snake, was it male or female? I will never know;
for the snake unwound itself from my arm and slowly
slithered into my lap. From there it crept onto the
table and moved towards the mirror. Perhaps it
wanted to enjoy its reflection at closer quarters.
I was no mere image cut in granite. I was suddenly
a man of flesh and blood. Still holding my breath I
got up from the chair. I quietly went out through
the door into the veranda. From there I leapt into
the yard and ran for all I was worth.

“Phew !” Each of us heaved a sigh of relief. Somebody
asked, “Doctor, is your wife very fat?”

##297##
11. “No,” the doctor said. “God willed otherwise. My life
companion is a thin reedy person with the gift of a
sprinter.”
Someone else asked, “Doctor, when you ran did the
snake follow you?”

##299##
The doctor replied, “I ran and ran till I reached
a friend’s house. Immediately I smeared oil all over
myself and took a bath. I changed into fresh clothes.
##300##
The next morning at about eight-thirty I took my
friend and one or two others to my room to move
my things from there. But we found we had little to
carry. Some thief had removed most of my things.
##301##
The room had been cleaned out! But not really, the
thief had left behind one thing as a final insult!’

##302##
12. “What was that?” I asked.
##303##
The doctor said, “My vest, the dirty one. The

fellow had such a sense of cleanliness...! The rascal
could have taken it and used it after washing it
with soap and water.”

“Did you see the snake the next day, doctor?”

was a snake which was taken with its own beauty!” taken with: attracted by

##332##
The little girl wondered if/whether she would be home before the TV show
began.

• Someone asked, “Why has the thief left the vest behind?”
Someone asked why the thief had left the vest behind.

##333##
The words if/whether are used to report questions which begin with: do, will,
can, have, are etc. These questions can be answered ‘yes’ or ‘no’.

Questions beginning with why/when/where/how/which/what are reported using
these same words.

##334##
The reporting verbs we use in questions with if/whether/why/when etc.
are: ask, inquire and wonder.

Remember that in reported speech,

• the present tense changes to past tense
• here, today, tomorrow, yesterday etc. change to there, that day, the next

day, the day before, etc.
• I/you change to me/him/he, etc., as necessary.

when you were very scared. You may have a competition to decide whose story
was the most frightening.

Dictation

The following paragraph is about the Indian cobra. Read it twice and close your
book. Your teacher will then dictate the paragraph to you. Write it down with
appropriate punctuation marks.

##343##
The Indian cobra is the common name for members of the family of venomous
snakes, known for their intimidating looks and deadly bite. Cobras are
recognised by the hoods that they flare when angry or disturbed; the hoods
are created by the extension of the ribs behind the cobras’ heads. Obviously
the best prevention is to avoid getting bitten. This is facilitated by the fact
that humans are not the natural prey of any venomous snake. We are a bit
large for them to swallow whole and they have no means of chopping us up
into bite-size pieces. Nearly all snakebites in humans are the result of a
snake defending itself when it feels threatened. In general snakes are shy
and will simply leave if you give them a chance.

Writing
##344##
1. Try to rewrite the story without its humour, merely as a frightening incident.

What details or parts of the story would you leave out?

##345##
2. Read the description given alongside this sketch from a photograph in a
newspaper (Times of India, 4 September 1999). Make up a story about what
the monkey is thinking, or why it is looking into a mirror. Write a paragraph
about it.

A monkey preens itself using a piece

A Legend of the Northland

This poem narrates the legend of an old lady who angered
Saint Peter because of her greed.

Away, away in the Northland,
Where the hours of the day are few,
And the nights are so long in winter
That they cannot sleep them through;

Where they harness the swift reindeer
To the sledges, when it snows;
And the children look like bear’s cubs
In their funny, furry clothes:

They tell them a curious story —
I don’t believe ’tis true;
And yet you may learn a lesson
##348##
If I tell the tale to you.

Once, when the good Saint Peter
Lived in the world below,
And walked about it, preaching,
Just as he did, you know,

He came to the door of a cottage,
In travelling round the earth,
Where a little woman was making cakes,
And baking them on the hearth;

And being faint with fasting,
For the day was almost done,
He asked her, from her store of cakes,
To give him a single one.

Reprint 2025-26



So she made a very little cake,
But as it baking lay,
She looked at it, and thought it seemed
Too large to give away.

Therefore she kneaded another,
And still a smaller one;
But it looked, when she turned it over,
As large as the first had done.

Then she took a tiny scrap of dough,
And rolled and rolled it flat;
And baked it thin as a wafer —
But she couldn’t part with that.

For she said, “My cakes that seem too small
When I eat of them myself
Are yet too large to give away.”
So she put them on the shelf.

Then good Saint Peter grew angry,
For he was hungry and faint;
And surely such a woman
Was enough to provoke a saint.

And he said, “You are far too selfish
To dwell in a human form,
To have both food and shelter,
And fire to keep you warm.

Now, you shall build as the birds do,
And shall get your scanty food
By boring, and boring, and boring,
All day in the hard, dry wood.”

Then up she went through the chimney,
Never speaking a word,
And out of the top flew a woodpecker,
For she was changed to a bird.

66 / Beehive

Reprint 2025-26



She had a scarlet cap on her head,
And that was left the same;
But all the rest of her clothes were burned
Black as a coal in the flame.

And every country schoolboy
Has seen her in the wood,
Where she lives in the trees till this very day,
Boring and boring for food.

6. My Childhood

BEFORE YOU READ

• Can you think of any scientists, who have also been
statesmen?

• A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, whose projects in space, defence and
nuclear technology guided India into the twenty-first century,
became our eleventh President in 2002.

• In his autobiography, Wings of Fire, he speaks of his
childhood.

##358##
1. I WAS born into a middle-class Tamil family in the
island town of Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras erstwhile: former

State. My father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much
formal education nor much wealth; despite these
disadvantages, he possessed great innate wisdom innate: inborn; (a

and a true generosity of spirit. He had an ideal quality or feeling) in

helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall one’s nature

the exact number of people she fed every day, but I
am quite certain that far more outsiders ate with
us than all the members of our own family
put together.

##359##
2. I was one of many children — a short boy with
rather undistinguished looks, born to tall and
handsome parents. We lived in our ancestral house,
which was built in the middle of the nineteenth
century. It was a fairly large pucca house, made of
limestone and brick, on the Mosque Street in
Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all austere: simple,

inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all strict and severe

necessities were provided for, in terms of food,
medicine or clothes. In fact, I would say mine
was a very secure childhood, both materially
and emotionally.

3. The Second World War broke out in 1939, when I
was eight years old. For reasons I have never been
able to understand, a sudden demand for tamarind
seeds erupted in the market. I used to collect the
seeds and sell them to a provision shop on Mosque
Street. A day’s collection would fetch me the princely princely sum:

sum of one anna. My brother-in-law Jallaluddin generous amount
(here, ironic)

would tell me stories about the War which I would
later attempt to trace in the headlines in Dinamani. anna: an old Indian

Allied Forces and something like a state of Allied Forces: the

in the form of the suspension of the train halt at during the Second
Rameswaram station. The newspapers now had to World War
be bundled and thrown out from the moving train
on the Rameswaram Road between Rameswaram
and Dhanuskodi. That forced my cousin Samsuddin,
who distributed newspapers in Rameswaram , to
look for a helping hand to catch the bundles and, as
if naturally, I filled the slot. Samsuddin helped me
earn my first wages. Half a century later, I can still
feel the surge of pride in earning my own money for
the first time.

4. Every child is born, with some inherited
characteristics, into a specific socio-economic and
emotional environment, and trained in certain ways
by figures of authority. I inherited honesty and self-
discipline from my father; from my mother, I
inherited faith in goodness and deep kindness and
so did my three brothers and sister. I had three
close friends in my childhood — Ramanadha Sastry,
Aravindan and Sivaprakasan. All these boys were
from orthodox Hindu Brahmin families. As children,
none of us ever felt any difference amongst ourselves
because of our religious differences and upbringing.
In fact, Ramanadha Sastry was the son of Pakshi
Lakshmana Sastry, the high priest of the
Rameswaram temple. Later, he took over the
priesthood of the Rameswaram temple from his

arranging transport for visiting pilgrims; and
Sivaprakasan became a catering contractor for the
Southern Railways.

##363##
5. During the annual Shri Sita Rama Kalyanam
ceremony, our family used to arrange boats with a
special platform for carrying idols of the Lord from
the temple to the marriage site, situated in the
middle of the pond called Rama Tirtha which was
near our house. Events from the Ramayana and
from the life of the Prophet were the bedtime stories
my mother and grandmother would tell the children
in our family.

##364##
6. One day when I was in the fifth standard at the
Rameswaram Elementary School, a new teacher
came to our class. I used to wear a cap which
marked me as a Muslim, and I always sat in the
front row next to Ramanadha Sastry, who wore the

Sastry. He looked utterly downcast as I shifted to downcast: sad or

my seat in the last row. The image of him weeping depressed

when I shifted to the last row left a lasting
impression on me.

##365##
7. After school, we went home and told our respective
parents about the incident. Lakshmana Sastry
summoned the teacher, and in our presence, told
the teacher that he should not spread the poison of
social inequality and communal intolerance in the
minds of innocent children. He bluntly asked the
teacher to either apologise or quit the school and
the island. Not only did the teacher regret his
behaviour, but the strong sense of conviction conviction: a strong

8. On the whole, the small society of Rameswaram
was very rigid in terms of the segregation of different
social groups. However, my science teacher
Sivasubramania Iyer, though an orthodox Brahmin
with a very conservative wife, was something of a
rebel. He did his best to break social barriers so
that people from varying backgrounds could mingle
easily. He used to spend hours with me and would
say, “Kalam, I want you to develop so that you
are on par with the highly educated people of the
big cities.”

9. One day, he invited me to his home for a meal. His
wife was horrified at the idea of a Muslim boy being

meal. His wife watched us from behind the kitchen
door. I wondered whether she had observed any
difference in the way I ate rice, drank water or
cleaned the floor after the meal. When I was leaving
his house, Sivasubramania Iyer invited me to join
him for dinner again the next weekend. Observing
my hesitation, he told me not to get upset, saying,
“Once you decide to change the system, such
problems have to be confronted.” When I visited his
house the next week, Sivasubramania Iyer’s wife
took me inside her kitchen and served me food with
her own hands.

##369##
10. Then the Second World War was over and India’s
freedom was imminent. “Indians will build their
own India,” declared Gandhiji. The whole country
was filled with an unprecedented optimism. I asked
my father for permission to leave Rameswaram
and study at the district headquarters in
Ramanathapuram.

11. He told me as if thinking aloud, “Abul ! I know you
have to go away to grow. Does the seagull not fly

Khalil Gibran to my hesitant mother, “Your children

of Life’s longing for itself. They come through you but
not from you. You may give them your love but not

1. From Rameswaram to the Rashtrapati Bhavan, it’s been a long journey.
Talking to Nona Walia on the eve of Teacher’s Day, President Dr A.P.J. Abdul

teacher to the Indian youth. “A proper education would help nurture a sense
of dignity and self-respect among our youth,” says President Kalam.

There’s still a child in him though, and he’s still curious about learning
new things. Life’s a mission for President Kalam.

2. Nonetheless, he remembers his first lesson in life and how it changed
his destiny. “I was studying in Standard V, and must have been all of 10. My
teacher, Sri Sivasubramania Iyer was telling us how birds fly. He drew a
diagram of a bird on the blackboard, depicting the wings, tail and the body
with the head and then explained how birds soar to the sky. At the end of
the class, I said I didn’t understand. Then he asked the other students if
they had understood, but nobody had understood how birds fly,” he recalls.

##399##
3. “That evening, the entire class was taken to Rameswarm shore,” the
President continues. “My teacher showed us sea birds. We saw marvellous
formations of them flying and how their wings flapped. Then my teacher
asked us, ‘Where is the birds’ engine and how is it powered?’ I knew then
that birds are powered by their own life and motivation. I understood all
about birds’ dynamics. This was real teaching — a theoretical lesson coupled
with a live practical example. Sri Siva Subramania Iyer was a great teacher.”

That day, my future was decided. My destiny was changed. I knew my
future had to be about flight and flight systems.

No Men Are Foreign

Have you ever thought of some people as strange, or other
countries as ‘foreign’? We have many ways of thinking of
other people as different from ‘us’, as ‘them.’ ‘They’ may
belong to a different country, or speak a different language.
In this poem, however, the poet reminds us of the many ways
in which we are all the same — for we are all human.

Remember, no men are strange, no countries foreign
Beneath all uniforms, a single body breathes
Like ours: the land our brothers walk upon
Is earth like this, in which we all shall lie.

They, too, aware of sun and air and water,
Are fed by peaceful harvests, by war’s long winter starv’d.
Their hands are ours, and in their lines we read
A labour not different from our own.

Remember they have eyes like ours that wake
Or sleep, and strength that can be won
By love. In every land is common life
That all can recognise and understand.

Let us remember, whenever we are told
To hate our brothers, it is ourselves
That we shall dispossess, betray, condemn.
Remember, we who take arms against each other

It is the human earth that we defile.
Our hells of fire and dust outrage the innocence
Of air that is everywhere our own,
Remember, no men are foreign, and no countries strange.

very current and idiomatic. An exercise of matching words and phrases to
their meanings has been given as a pre-reading activity to facilitate students’
understanding and appreciation of this part of the text.

In this unit students are asked to imagine that they have to give a speech.
They may wish to read the texts of well-known speeches such as Nehru’s
‘Tryst with Destiny’. A speech is a formal use of spoken language. It must be
prepared meticulously.

##410##
The language is formal but should be made powerful by the use of balance
(“Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your
country.” — Kennedy), imagery (“The light has gone out of our lives” — Nehru)
and other such rhetorical devices. It can be enriched by the use of examples
and anecdotes.

##411##
The Writing task of composing an article for a school magazine can be prepared
for by looking at other examples of such articles in newspapers. This task
makes a beginning in helping students to write for the print media. Encourage
them to work within a given word limit (such as 500 words, or 1000 words),
and to use everyday, contemporary language.

Help students to write a description of Santosh Yadav’s character by drawing
their attention to her background, likes and dislikes, her humanity and her
contribution to society.

##412##
8. KATHMANDU

‘Kathmandu’ is excerpted from Heaven Lake, a travelogue in which Vikram
Seth gives an account of what he saw, thought and felt when he travelled from
China to Tibet, from Heaven Lake to the Himalayas.

##413##
The map reading activity and the activity on locating the possible routes (by
road, rail or air) from Kathmandu to different places in India are designed to
link the lesson to the outside world. Students may wish to consult brochures
or travel guides, visit a  travel agency or call them on the telephone, speak to
people who have been to Nepal, and so on. This is a ‘communicative’ and
‘authentic’ task.

To prepare for the second Speaking task, students can listen to cricket/
football commentaries or eyewitness accounts of the Independence Day/
Republic Day parade in class or at home on radio or T.V.  Encourage them
to observe the use of the language and follow the narration. Have a
discussion in the class on the features of the commentary (its language, its
liveliness, etc.)

 A diary can be an opportunity to write freely about our life and the things
that happen to us — funny, sad, happy, embarrassing or fearful. We also
make notes on places we visit or our encounters with people.

##414##
The Writing task suggests that diary entries can form the basis of a
travelogue, and asks students to imagine a journey to Kathmandu. It may be
supplemented by an actual travelogue-writing task given after a long holiday,
or after a class trip out of the town.

##415##
9. IF I WERE YOU

This one-act play is to be read aloud in class by assigning roles to students.
Draw the students’ attention to the stage setting, stage directions, description
of the characters, their movements, gestures and tonal variations, since these
combine to bring out the effect of the play.

##416##
The play has many examples of wit and irony. Two examples are given in an
exercise. You can add a few more for the students to have a clear understanding.

##417##
The dictionary task in this unit is to help children locate the right meaning
from a dictionary for a word they come across while reading. The task draws
students’ attention to ‘signposts’ such as parts of speech that help match use
to meaning. Encourage the students to look at more entries in the dictionary
and observe the meanings of words that occur as different parts of speech
(adjective, noun, verb).

Santosh Yadav

BEFORE YOU READ

• Think for a while and make a list of three to five persons you
idolise, or admire very much for their achievements. Your
idols may be from any sphere of life — sports, medicine,
media, or art and culture.

• Your teacher will then discuss your choices with you to find
out who the top five idols of your class are.

1. The only woman in the world who
has scaled Mt Everest twice was
born in a society where the birth of
a son was regarded as a blessing,
and a daughter, though not
considered a curse, was not
generally welcome. When her mother
was expecting Santosh, a travelling
‘holy man’, giving her his blessing,
assumed that she wanted a son.
But, to everyone’s surprise, the
unborn child’s grandmother, who
was standing close by, told him that
they did not want a son. The ‘holy
man’ was also surprised!
Nevertheless, he gave the requested
blessing . . . and as destiny would
have it, the blessing seemed to work.
Santosh was born the sixth child in
a family with five sons, a sister to

five brothers. She was born in the small village of
Joniyawas of Rewari District in Haryana.

##420##
2. The girl was given the name ‘Santosh’, which means
contentment. But Santosh was not always content
with her place in a traditional way of life. She began
living life on her own terms from the start. Where
other girls wore traditional Indian dresses, Santosh
preferred shorts. Looking back, she says now, “From
the very beginning I was quite determined that if I
chose a correct and a rational path, the others
around me had to change, not me.”

##421##
3. Santosh’s parents were affluent landowners who
could afford to send their children to the best
schools, even to the country’s capital, New Delhi,
which was quite close by. But, in line with the in line with: following

prevailing custom in the family, Santosh had to or in accordance
with; according to

make do with the local village school. So, she decided
to fight the system in her own quiet way when
the right moment arrived. And the right moment
came when she turned sixteen. At sixteen, most of
the girls in her village used to get married.
Santosh was also under pressure from her parents
to do the same.

##422##
4. A marriage as early as that was the last thing on the last thing: the

her mind. She threatened her parents that she
would never marry if she did not get a proper
education. She left home and got herself enrolled
in a school in Delhi. When her parents refused to
pay for her education, she politely informed them
of her plans to earn money by working part time to
pay her school fees. Her parents then agreed to pay
for her education.

##423##
5. Wishing always to study “a bit more” and with her
father slowly getting used to her urge for more
education, Santosh passed the high school
examinations and went to Jaipur. She joined
Maharani College and got a room in Kasturba Hostel.
Santosh remembers, “Kasturba Hostel faced the

I could join them. To my pleasant surprise, they
answered in the affirmative and motivated me to
take to climbing.”

##425##
6. Then there was no looking back for this determined
young girl. She saved money and enrolled in a
course at Uttarkashi’s Nehru Institute of
Mountaineering. “My college semester in Jaipur was
to end in April but it ended on the nineteenth of
May. And I was supposed to be in Uttarkashi on
the twenty-first. So, I did not go back home; instead,
I headed straight for the training. I had to write a headed straight for :

letter of apology to my father without whose went towards

permission I had got myself enrolled at Uttarkashi.”
##426##
7. Thereafter, Santosh went on an

expedition every year. Her climbing
skills matured rapidly. Also, she
developed a remarkable resistance to
cold and the altitude. Equipped with
an iron will, physical endurance and
an amazing mental toughness, she
proved herself repeatedly. The
culmination of her hard work and
sincerity came in 1992, just four years
after she had shyly asked the Aravalli
mountaineers if she could join them.
At barely twenty years of age, Santosh
Yadav scaled Mt Everest, becoming the
youngest woman in the world to
achieve the feat. If her climbing skills,
physical fitness, and mental strength
impressed her seniors, her concern for
others and desire to work together with Iron will, physical endurance and

them found her a special place in the mental toughness characterise

##427##
8. During the 1992 Everest mission, Santosh Yadav
provided special care to a climber who lay dying at
the South Col. She was unfortunately unsuccessful
in saving him. However, she managed to save
another climber, Mohan Singh, who would have
met with the same fate had she not shared her
oxygen with him.

##428##
9. Within twelve months, Santosh found herself a
member of an Indo-Nepalese Women’s Expedition
that invited her to join them. She then scaled the
Everest a second time, thus setting a record as the
only woman to have scaled the Everest twice, and
securing for herself and India a unique place in the
annals of mountaineering. In recognition
of her achievements, the Indian government
bestowed upon her one of the nation’s top honours, top honours: highest

##429##
10. Describing her feelings when she was literally ‘on the enormity of the

top of the world’, Santosh has said, “It took some moment: a very great

Part II

Maria Sharapova

BEFORE YOU READ

• A Russian girl, Maria Sharapova, reached the summit of
women’s tennis when she was barely eighteen. As you read
about her, see if you can draw a comparison between her
and Santosh Yadav.

• Match the following.

something disarming quickly, almost immediately

at odds with more calm, confident and in control
than people of her age usually are

glamorous attire in contrast to; not agreeing with

in almost no time something that makes you feel friendly,

• As you read, look for the answers to these questions.
– Why was Maria sent to the United States?
– Why didn’t her mother go with her?
– What are her hobbies? What does she like?
– What motivates her to keep going?

##449##
1. THERE is something disarming about Maria
Sharapova, something at odds with her ready smile
and glamorous attire. And that something in her
lifted her on Monday, 22 August 2005 to the world
number one position in women’s tennis. All this
happened in almost no time. Poised beyond her
years, the Siberian born teenager took just four
years as a professional to reach the pinnacle.

##450##

Reprint 2025-26



Maria Sharapova won the women’s singles
at Wimbledon in 2004

##451##
2. However, the rapid ascent in a fiercely competitive
world began nine years before with a level of
sacrifice few children would be prepared to endure.
Little Maria had not yet celebrated her tenth
birthday when she was packed off to train in the
United States. That trip to Florida with her father
Yuri launched her on the path to success and
stardom. But it also required a heart-wrenching
two-year separation from her mother Yelena. The
latter was compelled to stay back in Siberia because
of visa restrictions. The nine-year-old girl had
already learnt an important lesson in life — that
tennis excellence would only come at a price.

##452##
3. “I used to be so lonely,” Maria Sharapova recalls. “I
missed my mother terribly. My father was working
as much as he could to keep my tennis-training
going. So, he couldn’t see me either.

##453##
4. “Because I was so young, I used to go to bed at
8 p.m. The other tennis pupils would come in at

90 / Beehive

Reprint 2025-26



11 p.m. and wake me up and order me to tidy up
the room and clean it.

##454##
5. “Instead of letting that depress me, I became more
quietly determined and mentally tough.
I learnt how to take care of myself. I never thought
of quitting because I knew what I wanted. When
you come from nothing and you have nothing, then
it makes you very hungry and determined . . . I would
have put up with much more humiliation and insults
than that to steadfastly pursue my dream.”

##455##
6. That toughness runs through Maria even today. It
was the key to her bagging the women’s singles crown
at Wimbledon in 2004 and to her meteoric rise to
the world number one spot the following year.

##456##
7. While her journey from the frozen plains of Siberia
to the summit of women’s tennis has touched the
hearts of tennis fans, for the youngster herself there
appears to be no room for sentiment. The straight
looks and the answers she gives when asked about
her ambition make it amply clear that she considers
the sacrifices were worth it. “I am very, very
competitive. I work hard at what I do. It’s my job.”
This is her mantra for success.

##457##
8. Though Maria Sharapova speaks with a pronounced
American accent, she proudly parades her Russian
nationality. Clearing all doubts, she says, “I’m
Russian. It’s true that the U.S. is a big part of my
life. But I have Russian citizenship. My blood is
totally Russian. I will play the Olympics for Russia
if they want me.”

##458##
9. Like any number of teenaged sensations, Maria
Sharapova lists fashion, singing and dancing as her
hobbies. She loves reading the novels of Arthur Conan
Doyle. Her fondness for sophisticated evening gowns
appears at odds with her love of pancakes with
chocolate spread and fizzy orange drinks.

##459##
10. Maria Sharapova cannot be pigeon-holed or
categorised. Her talent, unwavering desire to
succeed and readiness to sacrifice have lifted her
to the top of the world. Few would grudge her the

riches she is now reaping. This is what she has to
say about her monetary gains from tennis:
“Of course, money is a motivation. Tennis is a
business and a sport, but the most important thing
is to become number one in the world. That’s the
dream that kept me going.”

Thinking about Language
Look at the following sentences. They each have two clauses, or two parts each
with their own subject and verb or verb phrase. Often, one part (italicised) tells
us when or why something happened.

• I reached the market when most of the shops had closed. (Tells us when I
reached.)

4. Little Maria had not yet celebrated her tenth birthday when she was packed
off to train in the United States. (Tells us when Maria was sent to the U.S.)

II. Now rewrite the pairs of sentences given below as one sentence.
##470##
1. Grandfather told me about the old days. All books were printed on paper then.
##471##
2. What do you do after you finish the book? Perhaps you just throw it away.

3. He gave the little girl an apple. He took the computer apart.
##473##
4. You have nothing. That makes you very determined.

5. I never thought of quitting. I knew what I wanted.

Dictation
Read the passage once. Then close your books. Your teacher will dictate the
story to you. Write it down with the correct punctuation and paragraphing.

##475##
The Raincoat

After four years of drought in a small town in the Northeast, the Vicar
gathered everyone together for a pilgrimage to the mountain, where they
would pray together and ask for the rain to return.

##476##
The priest noticed a boy in the group wearing a raincoat.
“Have you gone mad?” he asked. “It hasn’t rained in this region for

five years, the heat will kill you climbing the mountain.”
“I have a cold, father. If we are going to ask God for rain, can you

imagine the way back from the mountain? It’s going to be such a downpour
that I need to be prepared.”

At that moment a great crash was heard in the sky and the first
drops began to fall. A boy’s faith was enough to bring about a miracle
that not even those most prepared truly believed in.

(translated by JAMES MULHOLLAND)

Speaking

On Killing a Tree

You must have observed people cutting down trees. But can
they kill a tree? Is it easy to do so? Let’s read the poem and
find out what the poet says on killing a tree.

It takes much time to kill a tree,
Not a simple jab of the knife
Will do it. It has grown
Slowly consuming the earth,
Rising out of it, feeding
Upon its crust, absorbing
Years of sunlight, air, water,
And out of its leprous hide
Sprouting leaves.

So hack and chop
But this alone wont do it.
Not so much pain will do it.
##478##
The bleeding bark will heal
And from close to the ground
Will rise curled green twigs,
Miniature boughs
Which if unchecked will expand again
To former size.

No,
##479##
The root is to be pulled out —
Out of the anchoring earth;
It is to be roped, tied,
And pulled out — snapped out

Or pulled out entirely,
Out from the earth-cave,
And the strength of the tree exposed

##482##
The most sensitive, hidden
For years inside the earth.

Then the matter
Of scorching and choking
In sun and air,
Browning, hardening,
Twisting, withering,
And then it is done.

Trees
I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.

A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;

A tree that looks at God all day
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;

A tree that may in summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;

Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.

Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.

5. I consider what route I should take back home. If I

were propelled by enthusiasm for travel per se, per-se: by itself

I would go by bus and train to Patna, then sail up
the Ganges past Benaras to Allahabad, then up the
Yamuna, past Agra to Delhi. But I am too exhausted

6. I look at the flute seller standing in a corner of the
square near the hotel. In his hand is a pole with
an attachment at the top from which fifty or sixty
bansuris protrude in all directions, like the quills
of a porcupine. They are of bamboo: there are cross-
flutes and recorders. From time to time he stands
the pole on the ground, selects a flute and plays
for a few minutes. The sound rises clearly above
the noise of the traffic and the hawkers’ cries. He
plays slowly, meditatively, without excessive meditatively:

display. He does not shout out his wares. thoughtfully

Occasionally he makes a sale, but in a curiously
offhanded way as if this were incidental to his offhanded: casual;

enterprise. Sometimes he breaks off playing to talk not showing much
interest in something

to the fruit seller. I imagine that this has been the
pattern of his life for years.

7. I find it difficult to tear myself away from the square.
Flute music always does this to me: it is at once
the most universal and most particular of sounds.
There is no culture that does not have its flute—
the reed neh, the recorder, the Japanese shakuhachi,
the deep bansuri of Hindustani classical music,
the clear or breathy flutes of South America,

8. That I can be so affected by a few familiar phrases

IV. Simple Present Tense

Study these sentences from the lesson.
• A fight breaks out between two monkeys.
• Film songs blare out from the radios.
• I wash it down with Coca-Cola.

##524##
The italicised verbs are in the simple present tense. The writer is here describing
what he saw and heard but he uses the present tense instead of the past tense.
A narration or a story can be made more dramatic or immediate by using the
present tense in this way.

Now look at the following sentences.
• A small shrine half protrudes from the stone platform on the riverbank.
• Small shops stand on the outer edge of the Stupa.

We use the simple present tense to speak about what is usually or generally
true. The sentences above describe facts. We also use the simple present tense
in sentences depicting ‘universal truths’. For example:
• The sun rises in the east.
• The earth revolves round the sun.

We can also refer to habitual actions using the simple present tense.
• He usually takes a train instead of a bus to work.
• We often get fine drizzles in winter.

In these sentences words like everyday, often, seldom, never, every month,
generally, usually, etc. may be used.

A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal

This poem is about the death of a loved one. How does the
poet feel when he thinks about her death? How does he
imagine her to be, after death?

A slumber did my spirit seal—
I had no human fears.
She seemed a thing that could not feel
##529##
The touch of earthly years.
##530##
No motion has she now, no force—
She neither hears nor sees,
Rolled round in earth’s diurnal course
With rocks and stones and trees.

WILLIAM WORDSWORTH

GLOSSARY

diurnal: daily (“Earth’s diurnal course” is earth’s daily rotation on its axis.)

Thinking about the Poem

##531##
1. “A slumber did my spirit seal,” says the poet. That is, a deep sleep ‘closed
off ’ his soul (or mind). How does the poet react to his loved one’s death? Does
he feel bitter grief ? Or does he feel a great peace?

##532##
2. The passing of time will no longer affect her, says the poet. Which lines of
the poem say this?

##533##
3. How does the poet imagine her to be, after death? Does he think of her as a
person living in a very happy state (a ‘heaven’)? Or does he see her now as a
part of nature? In which lines of the poem do you find your answer?

Fear No More

Fear no more the heat o’ the sun,
Nor the furious winter’s rages;
Thou thy worldly task hast done,
Home art gone, and ta’en thy wages:
Golden lads and girls all must,
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

Fear no more the frown o’ the great,
Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke;
Care no more to clothe and eat;
To thee the reed is as the oak:
##535##
The sceptre, learning, physic, must
All follow this, and come to dust.

Fear no more the lightning-flash,
Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;
Fear not slander, censure rash;
Thou hast finished joy and moan:
All lovers young, all lovers must
Consign to thee, and come to dust.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

Theresa Kane says that she likes this poem  ... because it is so
exhilarating. It sweeps me along in the splendid, stormy words,
then there is the quiet, peaceful lagoon of the last two lines of each
verse. It is a wonderful poem, as hard, proud and fierce as a rock
in a storm.

SCENE: A small cottage interior. There is an entrance back right (which
may be curtained). Another door to the left must be a practical door. The
furniture is simple, consisting of a small table towards the left, a chair or
two, and a divan rather upstage on the right. On the table is a telephone.

(When the curtain rises Gerrard is standing by the table making a phone
call. He is of medium height, and wearing horn-rimmed glasses . . . He
is dressed in a lounge suit and a great coat. His voice is cultured.)
GERRARD : . .. Well, tell him to phone up directly. I must know ...

Yes, I expect I’ll still be here, but you mustn’t count on
that ... In about ten minutes’ time. Right-ho. Goodbye.

(He puts down the phone and goes to the divan on the left, where there
is a travelling bag, and starts packing. Whilst he is thus engaged, another
man, similar in build to Gerrard enters from the right silently — revolver
in hand. He is flashily dressed in an overcoat and a soft hat. He bumps
accidentally against the table, and at the sound Gerrard turns quickly.)

GERRARD : (pleasantly) Why, this is a surprise, Mr— er —
INTRUDER : I’m glad you’re pleased to see me. I don’t think you’ll be

pleased for long. Put those paws up!
GERRARD : This is all very melodramatic, not very original, perhaps,

GERRARD : ‘Nonchalant’ is your word, I think.

begin I should like to change my position; you may be
comfortable, but I am not.

INTRUDER : Sit down there, and no funny business. (Motions to a
chair, and seats himself on the divan by the bag.) Now
then, we’ll have a nice little talk about yourself!

GERRARD : At last a sympathetic audience! I’ll tell you the story of
my life. How as a child I was stolen by the gypsies, and
why at the age of thirty-two, I find myself in my lonely
Essex cottage, how ...

INTRUDER : Keep it to yourself, and just answer my questions. You
live here alone? Well, do you?

GERRARD : I’m sorry. I thought you were telling me, not asking me.
A question of inflection; your voice is unfamiliar.

INTRUDER : (with emphasis) Do you live here alone?
GERRARD : And if I don’t answer?
INTRUDER : You’ve got enough sense not to want to get hurt.
GERRARD : I think good sense is shown more in the ability to avoid

pain than in the mere desire to do so. What do you think,
Mr— er—

INTRUDER : Never mind my name. I like yours better, Mr Gerrard.
What are your Christian names?

GERRARD : Vincent Charles.
INTRUDER : Do you run a car?
GERRARD : No.
INTRUDER : That’s a lie. You’re not dealing with a fool. I’m as smart

as you and smarter, and I know you run a car. Better be
careful, wise guy!

GERRARD : Are you American, or is that merely a clever imitation?
INTRUDER : Listen, this gun’s no toy. I can hurt you without killing

you, and still get my answers.
GERRARD : Of course, if you put it like that, I’ll be glad to assist you.

I do possess a car, and it’s in the garage round the corner.
INTRUDER : That’s better. Do people often come out here?
GERRARD : Very rarely. Surprisingly few people take the trouble to

visit me. There’s the baker and the greengrocer, of course;
and then there’s the milkman — quite charming, but no
one so interesting as yourself.

INTRUDER : I happen to know that you never see tradespeople.

Since you know so much about me, won’t you say

INTRUDER : I could tell you plenty. You think you’re smart, but I’m
the top of the class round here. I’ve got brains and I use
them. That’s how I’ve got where I have.

GERRARD : And where precisely have you got? It didn’t require a
great brain to break into my little cottage.

INTRUDER : When you know why I’ve broken into your little cottage,
you’ll be surprised, and it won’t be a pleasant surprise.

GERRARD : With you figuring so largely in it, that is understandable.
By the way, what particular line of crime do you embrace,
or aren’t you a specialist?

INTRUDER : My speciality’s jewel robbery. Your car will do me a treat.
It’s certainly a dandy bus.

GERRARD : I’m afraid jewels are few and far between in the wilds of
Essex.

INTRUDER : So are the cops. I can retire here nicely for a little while.
GERRARD : You mean to live with me? A trifle sudden isn’t it; you’ve

not been invited.
INTRUDER : You won’t be here long; so I didn’t trouble to ask.
GERRARD : What do you mean?
INTRUDER : This is your big surprise. I’m going to kill you.
GERRARD : A little harsh, isn’t it?
INTRUDER : (with heavy sarcasm) Yeah, I’ll be sorry to do it. I’ve taken

a fancy to you, but it’s just got to be done.
GERRARD : Why add murder to your other crimes? It’s a grave step

you’re taking.
INTRUDER : I’m not taking it for fun. I’ve been hunted long enough.

I’m wanted for murder already, and they can’t hang me
twice.

GERRARD : You’re planning a gratuitous double, so to speak. Admitted
you’ve nothing to lose, but what have you to gain?

INTRUDER : I’ve got freedom to gain. As for myself, I’m a poor hunted
rat. As Vincent Charles Gerrard I’m free to go places and
do nothing. I can eat well and sleep and without having
to be ready to beat it at the sight of a cop.

his killing long enough to be frustrated. You are much

not careful.

GERRARD : That is extremely interesting, but you seem to miss the

point of my remark. I said, you were luckier than most
melodramatic villains. It was not a tribute to your
intelligence. You won’t kill me for a very good reason.

INTRUDER : Yes, I like the idea.
GERRARD : But are you sure it’s going to help you?

town. Things went wrong and I killed a cop. Since then
I’ve done nothing but dodge.

GERRARD : And this is where dodging has brought you?

car. Two other people saw you and started to talk. I
listened. It looks like you’re a bit queer — kind of a mystery

that is  irony. You’re saying ‘clever‘ to mean ‘not clever’.

• Oh, wasn’t that clever!/Oh that was clever!

• You have been a great help, I must say!

• You’ve got yourself into a lovely mess, haven’t you?

• Oh, very funny!/ How funny!

What the author says What he means

Why, this is a surprise, Mr —er — He pretends that the intruder is a
social visitor whom he is welcoming.
In this way he hides his fear.

Dictionary Use
A word can mean different things in different contexts. Look at these three
sentences:
• The students are taught to respect different cultures.
• The school is organising a cultural show.
• His voice is cultured.

In the first sentence, ‘culture’ (noun) means way of life; in the second, ‘cultural’
(adjective) means connected with art, literature and music; and in the third,
‘cultured’ (verb) means sophisticated, well mannered. Usually a dictionary helps
you identify the right meaning by giving you signposts.

Look at the dictionary entry on ‘culture’ from Oxford Advanced Learner’s
Dictionary, 2005.
