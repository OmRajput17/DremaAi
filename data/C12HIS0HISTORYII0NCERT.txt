FOREWORD

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on
the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They
also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures
will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system
of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).

The success of this effort depends on the steps that school
principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on
their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.
We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children
generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on
to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis
of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites
of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible
if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as
receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode
of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as
rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods
used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this
textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have
tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring
and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration
for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space
to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the
advisory group in Social Sciences, Professor Hari Vasudevan, and the
Chief Advisor for this book, Professor Neeladri Bhattacharya, Centre for
Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi for guiding
the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the
development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for
making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and
organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their

resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the
members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the
Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human
Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal
Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and
contribution. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and
continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT
welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to
undertake further revision and refinement.

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOKS

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce
content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020,
also emphasises reducing the content load and providing
opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In
this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to
rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes
already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken
into consideration in this exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the
following:

• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject
areas in the same class

• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the
same subject

• Difficulty level

• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children
through self-learning or peer-learning

• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying
out the changes given above.

DEFINING THE FOCUS OF STUDY

What defines the focus of this book? What does it seek to do? How
is it linked to what has been studied in earlier classes?

In Classes VI to VIII we looked at Indian history from early
beginnings to modern times, with a focus on one chronological
period in each year. Then in the books for Classes IX and X, the
frame of reference changed. We looked at a shorter period of time,
focusing specifically on a close study of the contemporary world.
We moved beyond territorial boundaries, beyond the limits of nation
states, to see how different people in different places have played
their part in the making of the modern world. The history of India
became connected to a wider inter-linked history. Subsequently in
Class XI we studied Themes in World History, expanding our
chronological focus, looking at the vast span of years from the
beginning of human life to the present, but selecting only a set of
themes for serious exploration. This year we will study Themes in
Indian History.

The book begins with Harappa and ends with the framing of the
Indian Constitution. What it offers is not a general survey of five
millennia, but a close study of select themes. The history books in
earlier years have already acquainted you with Indian history. It is
time we explored some themes in greater detail.

In choosing the themes we have tried to ensure that we learn
about developments in different spheres – economic, cultural, social,
political, and religious – even as we attempt to break the boundaries
between them. Some themes in the book will introduce you to the
politics of the times and the nature of authority and power; others
explore the way societies are organised, and the way they function
and change; still others tell us about religious life and ritual
practices, about the working of economies, and the changes within
rural and urban societies.

Each of these themes will also allow you to have a closer look at
the historians’ craft. To retrieve the past, historians have to find
sources that make the past accessible. But sources do not just reveal
the past; historians have to grapple with sources, interpret them,
and make them speak. This is what makes history exciting. The
same sources can tell us new things if we ask new questions, and
engage with them in new ways. So we need to see how historians
read sources, and how they discover new things in old sources.

But historians do not only re-examine old records. They discover
new ones. Sometimes these could be chance discoveries.
Archaeologists may unexpectedly come across seals and mounds
that provide clues to the existence of a site of an ancient civilisation.
Rummaging through the dusty records of a district collectorate a

Reprint 2025-26

historian may trip over a bundle of records that contain legal cases
of local disputes, and these may open up a new world of village life
several centuries back. Yet are such discoveries only accidents? You
may bump into a bundle of old records in an archive, open it up
and see it, without discovering the significance of the source. The
source may mean nothing to you unless you have relevant questions
in mind. You have to track the source, read the text, follow the clues,
and make the inter-connections before you can reconstruct the past.
The physical discovery of a record does not simply open up the
past. When Alexander Cunningham first saw a Harappan seal, he
could make no sense of it. Only much later was the significance of
the seals discovered.

In fact when historians begin to ask new questions, explore new
themes, they have to often search for new types of sources. If we
wish to know about revolutionaries and rebels, official sources can
reveal only a partial picture, one that will be shaped by official
censure and prejudice. We need to look for other sources – diaries
of rebels, their personal letters, their writings and pronouncements.
And these are not always easy to come by. If we have to understand
experiences of people, then oral sources might reveal more than
written sources.

As the vision of history broadens, historians begin tracking new
sources, searching for new clues to understand the past. And when
that happens, the conception of what constitutes a source itself
changes. There was a time when only written records were
acknowledged as authentic. What was written could be verified,
cited, and cross-checked. Oral evidence was never considered a valid
source: who was to guarantee its authenticity and verifiability? This
mistrust of oral sources has not yet disappeared, but oral evidence
has been innovatively used to uncover experiences that no other
record could reveal.

Through the book this year, you will enter the world of historians,
accompany them in their search for new clues, and see how they
carry on their dialogues with the past. You will witness the way they
tease out meaning out of records, read inscriptions, excavate
archaeological sites, make sense of beads and bones, interpret the
epics, look at the stupas and buildings, examine paintings and
photographs, interpret police reports and revenue records, and listen
to the voices of the past. Each theme will explore the peculiarities
and possibilities of one particular type of source. It will discuss what
a source can tell and what it cannot.

This is Part II, of Themes in Indian History. Part III will follow.

Through the Eyes of Travellers
THEME

Perceptions of Society
FIVE

(c. tenth to seventeenth century)

Women and men have travelled in search of work, to escape
from natural disasters, as traders, merchants, soldiers,
priests, pilgrims, or driven by a sense of adventure.
Those who visit or come to stay in a new land
invariably encounter a world that is different:
in terms of the landscape or physical
environment as well as customs, languages,
beliefs and practices of people. Many of them
try to adapt to these differences; others,
somewhat exceptional, note them carefully in

unusual or remarkable. Unfortunately, we have
practically no accounts of travel left by women, though
we know that they travelled.

The accounts that survive are often varied in terms of
their subject matter. Some deal with affairs of the court,
while others are mainly focused on religious issues, or
architectural features and monuments. For example, one
of the most important descriptions of the city of
Vijayanagara (Chapter 7) in the fifteenth century comes
from Abdur Razzaq Samarqandi, a diplomat who came
visiting from Herat.

In a few cases, travellers did not go to distant lands. For
example, in the Mughal Empire (Chapters 8 and 9),
administrators sometimes travelled within the
empire and recorded their observations. Some
of them were interested in looking at popular
customs and the folklore and traditions of
their own land.

In this chapter we shall see how our
knowledge of the past can be enriched
through a consideration of descriptions of
social life provided by travellers who visited
the subcontinent, focusing on the accounts of three Fig. 5.1b

Al-Biruni was born in 973, in Khwarizm in present-
day Uzbekistan. Khwarizm was an important centre
of learning, and Al-Biruni received the best
education available at the time. He was well versed
in several languages: Syriac, Arabic, Persian,
Hebrew and Sanskrit. Although he did not know
Greek, he was familiar with the works of Plato
and other Greek philosophers, having read
them  in Arabic translations. In 1017, when Sultan
Mahmud invaded Khwarizm, he took several
scholars and poets back to his capital, Ghazni;
Al-Biruni was one of them. He arrived in Ghazni as
a hostage, but gradually developed a liking for the
city, where he spent the rest of his life until his
death at the age of 70.

It was in Ghazni that Al-Biruni developed an
interest in India. This was not unusual. Sanskrit

The lonely traveller
Robbers were not the only hazard on long journeys: the traveller could feel homesick,
or fall ill. Here is an excerpt from the Rihla:

I was attacked by the fever, and I actually tied myself on the saddle with a turban-
cloth in case I should fall off by reason of my weakness ... So at last we reached
the town of Tunis, and the townsfolk came out to welcome the shaikh ... and ...
the son of the qazi ... On all sides they came forward with greetings and questions
to one another, but not a soul said a word of greeting to me, since there was none
of them I knew. I felt so sad at heart on account of my loneliness that I could not
restrain the tears that started to my eyes, and wept bitterly. But one of the pilgrims,
realising the cause of my distress, came up to me with a greeting ...

Travelling was also more insecure: Ibn Battuta
was attacked by bands of robbers several times.
In fact he preferred travelling in a caravan along
with companions, but this did not deter highway
robbers. While travelling from Multan to Delhi,
for instance, his caravan was attacked and many
of his fellow travellers lost their lives; those
travellers who survived, including Ibn Battuta,
were severely wounded.

2.2 The “enjoyment of curiosities”
As we have seen, Ibn Battuta was an inveterate
traveller who spent several years travelling through
north Africa, West Asia and parts of Central Asia
(he may even have visited Russia), the Indian
subcontinent and China, before returning to his
native land, Morocco. When he returned, the local
ruler issued instructions that his stories be recorded.

Education and entertainment

This is what Ibn Juzayy, who was deputed to write what
Ibn Battuta dictated, said in his introduction:

A gracious direction was transmitted (by the ruler)
that he (Ibn Battuta) should dictate an account of
the cities which he had seen in his travel, and of
the interesting events which had clung to his
memory, and that he should speak of those whom
he had met of the rulers of countries, of their
distinguished men of learning, and their pious saints.
Accordingly, he dictated upon these subjects a
narrative which gave entertainment to the mind
and delight to the ears and eyes, with a variety of
curious particulars by the exposition of which he
gave edif ication and of marvellous things, by
referring to which he aroused interest.

In the footsteps of Ibn Battuta
In the centuries between 1400 and 1800 visitors to India
wrote a number of travelogues in Persian. At the same
time, Indian visitors to Central Asia, Iran and the Ottoman
empire also sometimes wrote about their experiences.
These writers followed in the footsteps of Al-Biruni and
Ibn Battuta, and had sometimes read these earlier authors.

Among the best known of these writers were Abdur
Razzaq Samarqandi, who visited south India in the 1440s,
Mahmud Wali Balkhi, who travelled very widely in the
1620s, and Shaikh Ali Hazin, who came to north India in
the 1740s. Some of these authors were fascinated by India,
and one of them  Mahmud Balkhi  even became a sort
of sanyasi  for a time. Others such as Hazin were
disappointed and even disgusted with India, where they
expected to receive a red carpet treatment. Most of them
saw India as a land of wonders.

3. François Bernier
A Doctor with a Difference

Once the Portuguese arrived in India in about 1500,
a number of them wrote detailed accounts regarding
Indian social customs and religious practices. A few
of them, such as the Jesuit Roberto Nobili, even
translated Indian texts into European languages.

Among the best known of the Portuguese writers
is Duarte Barbosa, who wrote a detailed account of
trade and society in south India. Later, after 1600,
we find growing numbers of Dutch, English and
French travellers coming to India. One of the most
famous was the French jeweller Jean-Baptiste
Tavernier, who travelled to India at least six times.
He was particularly fascinated with the trading
conditions in India, and compared India to Iran and
the Ottoman empire. Some of these travellers, like
the Italian doctor Manucci, never returned to Europe,
and settled down in India.

François Bernier, a Frenchman, was a doctor,
political philosopher and historian. Like many

Mughal court, as a physician to Prince Dara Shukoh,
the eldest son of Emperor Shah Jahan, and later as
an intellectual and scientist, with Danishmand
Khan, an Armenian noble at the Mughal court.

3.1 Comparing “East” and “West”
Bernier travelled to several parts of the country, and
wrote accounts of what he saw, frequently comparing
what he saw in India with the situation in Europe.
He dedicated his major writing to Louis XIV, the
king of France, and many of his other works were
written in the form of letters to influential officials
and ministers. In virtually every instance Bernier
described what he saw in India as a bleak situation
in comparison to developments in Europe. As we
will see, this assessment was not always accurate.
However, when his works were published, Bernier’s
writings became extremely popular.

As we have seen, Al-Biruni’s description of the

the Brahmanas. However, in real life the system

of the period:

The city of Dehli covers a wide area and has a large population ...
The rampart round the city is without parallel. The breadth of its wall
is eleven cubits; and inside it are houses for the night sentry and gate-
keepers. Inside the ramparts, there are store-houses for storing edibles,
magazines, ammunition, ballistas and siege machines. The grains that
are stored (in these ramparts) can last for a long time, without rotting
... In the interior of the rampart, horsemen as well as infantrymen
move from one end of the city to another. The rampart is pierced
through by windows which open on the side of the city, and it is
through these windows that light enters inside. The lower part of the
rampart is built of stone; the upper part of bricks. It has many towers
close to one another. There are twenty eight gates of this city which
are called darwaza, and of these, the Budaun darwaza is the greatest;

The bazaars were not only places of economic
transactions, but also the hub of social and cultural
activities. Most bazaars had a mosque and a temple,
and in some of them at least, spaces were marked for
public performances by dancers, musicians and singers.

While Ibn Battuta was not particularly concerned
with explaining the prosperity of towns, historians have
used his account to suggest that towns derived a
significant portion of their wealth through the
appropriation of surplus from villages. Ibn Battuta
found Indian agriculture very productive because of
the fertility of the soil, which allowed farmers to
cultivate two crops a year. He also noted that the
subcontinent was well integrated with inter-Asian
networks of trade and commerce, with Indian
manufactures being in great demand in both West Asia
and Southeast Asia, fetching huge profits for artisans
and merchants. Indian textiles, particularly cotton
cloth, fine muslins, silks, brocade and satin, were in
great demand. Ibn Battuta informs us that certain
varieties of fine muslin were so expensive that they
could be worn only by the nobles and the very rich.

6. Bernier and the Degenerate
East

If Ibn Battuta chose to describe everything that
impressed and excited him because of its novelty,
François Bernier belonged to a different intellectual
tradition. He was far more preoccupied with
comparing and contrasting what he saw in India
with the situation in Europe in general and France
in particular, focusing on situations which he
considered depressing. His idea seems to have been
to influence policy-makers and the intelligentsia to
ensure that they made what he considered to be the
“right” decisions.

Bernier’s Travels in the Mughal Empire is marked
by detailed observations, critical insights and
reflection. His account contains discussions trying
to place the history of the Mughals within some sort
of a universal framework. He constantly compared
Mughal India with contemporary Europe, generally
emphasising the superiority of the latter. His
representation of India works on the model of
binary opposition, where India is presented as the
inverse of Europe. He also ordered the perceived
differences hierarchically, so that India appeared to
be inferior to the Western world.

6.1 The question of landownership
According to Bernier, one of the fundamental
differences between Mughal India and Europe was

a concern to maintain or improve the land. It had
led to the uniform ruination of agriculture, excessive
oppression of the peasantry and a continuous decline
in the living standards of all sections of society, except
the ruling aristocracy.

Source 11

The poor peasant

An excerpt from Berniers description of the peasantry in
the countryside:

Of the vast tracts of country constituting the empire of
Hindustan, many are little more than sand, or barren
mountains, badly cultivated, and thinly populated.
Even a considerable portion of the good land remains
untilled for want of labourers; many of whom perish in
consequence of the bad treatment they experience
from Governors. The poor people, when they become
incapable of discharging the demands of their
rapacious lords, are not only often deprived of the
means of subsistence, but are also made to lose their
children, who are carried away as slaves. Thus, it
happens that the peasantry, driven to despair by so
excessive a tyranny, abandon the country.

In this instance, Bernier was participating in
contemporary debates in Europe concerning the nature
of state and society, and intended that his description of
Mughal India would serve as a warning to those who did
not recognise the merits of private property. Fig. 5.11

subcontinent? Do you think his description
would have served to strengthen his case?

As an extension of this, Bernier described Indian
society as consisting of undifferentiated masses of
impoverished people, subjugated by a small minority
of a very rich and powerful ruling class. Between
the poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich,
there was no social group or class worth the name.
Bernier confidently asserted: “There is no middle
state in India.”

labourers. In between was the big peasant, who used
hired labour and engaged in commodity production, and
the smaller peasant who could barely produce for his
subsistence.

6.2 A more complex social reality
While Bernier’s preoccupation with projecting the
Mughal state as tyrannical is obvious, his descriptions
occasionally hint at a more complex social reality. For
instance, he felt that artisans had no incentive to
improve the quality of their manufactures, since profits
were appropriated by the state. Manufactures were,
consequently, everywhere in decline.  At the same time,
he conceded that vast quantities of the world’s precious
metals flowed into India, as manufactures were exported
in exchange for gold and silver. He also noticed the
existence of a prosperous merchant community,
engaged in long-distance exchange.

agriculture and craft production:

It is important to observe, that of this vast tract of country,
a large portion is extremely fertile; the large kingdom of
Bengale (Bengal), for instance, surpassing Egypt itself, not
only in the production of rice, corn, and other necessaries
of life, but of innumerable articles of commerce which are
not cultivated in Egypt; such as silks, cotton, and indigo.
There are also many parts of the Indies, where the
population is sufficiently abundant, and the land pretty well
tilled; and where the artisan, although naturally indolent,
is yet compelled by necessity or otherwise to employ himself
in manufacturing carpets, brocades, embroideries, gold
and silver cloths, and the various sorts of silk and cotton
goods, which are used in the country or exported abroad. Fig. 5.12

Bhakti - Sufi Traditions
THEME Changes in Religious Beliefs and

SIX Devotional Texts

(c. eighth to eighteenth century)

We saw in Chapter 4 that by the mid-first
millennium CE the landscape of the subcontinent
was dotted with a variety of religious structures –
stupas, monasteries, temples. If these typified
certain religious beliefs and practices, others have
been reconstructed from textual traditions,
including the Puranas, many of which received
their present shape around the same time, and yet
others remain only faintly visible in textual and
visual records.

New textual sources available from this period
include compositions attributed to poet-saints,
most of whom expressed themselves orally in
regional languages used by ordinary people. These
compositions, which were often set to music, were
compiled by disciples or devotees, generally after
the death of the poet-saint. What is more, these
traditions were fluid – generations of devotees tended
to elaborate on the original message, and occasionally
modified or even abandoned some of the ideas that
appeared problematic or irrelevant in different
political, social or cultural contexts. Using these
sources thus poses a challenge to historians.

Historians also draw on hagiographies or
biographies of saints written by their followers (or
members of their religious sect). These may not be
literally accurate, but allow a glimpse into the ways
in which devotees perceived the lives of these path-
breaking women and men.

As we will see, these sources provide us with
insights into a scenario characterised by dynamism
and diversity. Let us look at some elements of these
more closely.

If you compare Fig. 6.2 with Fig. 4.26 (Chapter 4)
you will notice that the deity is represented in a
very different way. In this instance, a local deity,
whose image was and continues to be made of wood
by local tribal specialists, was recognised as a form
of Vishnu. At the same time, Vishnu was visualised
in a way that was very different from that in other
parts of the country.

Such instances of integration are evident
amongst goddess cults as well. Worship of the
goddess, often simply in the form of a stone smeared
with ochre, was evidently widespread. These local
deities were often incorporated within the Puranic
framework by providing them with an identity as a
wife of the principal male deities – sometimes they
were equated with Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu, in
other instances, with Parvati, the wife of Shiva.

1.2 Difference and conflict

Sculpture of a Buddhist goddess,

an example of the process of of worship that were classified as Tantric. Tantric
integration of different religious practices were widespread in several parts of the
beliefs and practices subcontinent – they were open to women and

men, and practitioners often ignored differences
of caste and class within the ritual context. Many
of these ideas influenced Shaivism as well as
Buddhism,  especially in the eastern, northern and
southern parts of the subcontinent.

All of these somewhat divergent and even disparate
beliefs and practices would  come to be classified as
Hindu over the course of the next millennium. The
divergence is perhaps most stark if we compare Vedic
and Puranic traditions. The principal deities of the
Vedic pantheon, Agni, Indra and Soma, become
marginal figures, rarely visible in textual or visual
representations. And while we can catch a glimpse
of Vishnu, Shiva and the goddess in Vedic mantras,
these have little in common with the elaborate
Puranic mythologies. However, in spite of these
obvious discrepancies, the Vedas continued to be
revered as authoritative.

Not surprisingly, there were sometimes conflicts as
well – those who valued the Vedic tradition often
condemned practices that went beyond the closely
regulated contact with the divine through the
performance of sacrifices or precisely chanted mantras.

frequently ignored the authority of the Vedas. Also,
devotees often tended to project their chosen deity,

and Shaiva sects.

2. Poems of Prayer
Early Traditions of Bhakti

In the course of the evolution of these forms of
worship,  in many instances, poet-saints emerged
as leaders around whom there developed a
community of devotees. Further, while Brahmanas
remained important intermediaries between gods and
devotees in several forms of bhakti, these traditions
also accommodated and acknowledged women and
the “lower castes”, categories considered ineligible
for liberation within the orthodox Brahmanical
framework. What also characterised traditions of
bhakti was a remarkable diversity.

At a different level, historians of religion often
classify bhakti traditions into two broad categories:
saguna (with attributes) and nirguna (without
attributes). The former included traditions that
focused on the worship of specific deities such
as Shiva, Vishnu and his avatars (incarnations) and
forms of the goddess or Devi, all often conceptualised
in anthropomorphic forms. Nirguna bhakti on the
other hand was worship of an abstract form of god.

2.1 The Alvars and Nayanars of Tamil Nadu
Some of the earliest bhakti movements (c. sixth
century) were led by the Alvars (literally, those who
are “immersed” in devotion to Vishnu) and Nayanars
(literally, leaders who were devotees of Shiva). They

those of the Pallavas and Pandyas (c. sixth to ninth
centuries CE). While Buddhism and Jainism had
been prevalent in this region for several centuries,
drawing support from merchant and artisan
communities, these religious traditions received
occasional royal patronage.

Interestingly, one of the major themes in Tamil
bhakti hymns is the poets’ opposition to Buddhism
and Jainism. This is particularly marked in the

146  THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  PART II

compositions of the Nayanars. Historians have
attempted to explain this hostility by suggesting that
it was due to competition between members of
other religious traditions for royal patronage. What
is evident is that the powerful Chola rulers (ninth
to thirteenth centuries) supported Brahmanical
and bhakti traditions, making land grants and
constructing temples for Vishnu and Shiva.

In fact, some of the most magnificent Shiva
temples, including those at Chidambaram, Thanjavur
and Gangaikondacholapuram, were constructed
under the patronage of Chola rulers. This was also
the period when some of the most spectacular
representations of Shiva in bronze sculpture were
produced. Clearly, the visions of the Nayanars
inspired artists.

Both Nayanars and Alvars were revered by the
Vellala peasants. Not surprisingly, rulers tried to
win their support as well. The Chola kings, for

4. Religious Ferment in
North India

During the same period, in north India deities such as
Vishnu and Shiva were worshipped in temples, often built
with the support of rulers. However, historians have not
found evidence of anything resembling the compositions
of the Alvars and Nayanars till the fourteenth century.
How do we account for this difference?

Some historians point out that in north India this
was the period when several Rajput states emerged. In
most of these states Brahmanas occupied positions of
importance, performing a range of secular and ritual
functions. There seems to have been little or no attempt
to challenge their position directly.

At the same time other
religious leaders, who did not
function within the orthodox
Brahmanical framework, were
gaining ground. These included
the Naths, Jogis and Siddhas.
Many of them came from
artisanal groups, including
weavers, who were becoming

production grew with the
emergence of new urban centres,
and long-distance trade with
Central Asia and West Asia.

eighth or ninth century religious leaders were not in a position to win the

support of the ruling elites.
A new element in this situation was the coming of

the Turks which culminated in the establishment of the
Delhi Sultanate (thirteenth century). This undermined
the power of many of the Rajput states and the
Brahmanas who were associated with these kingdoms.
This was accompanied by marked changes in the realm
of culture and religion. The coming of the sufis
(Section 6) was a significant part of these developments.

5. New Strands in the Fabric
Islamic Traditions

Just as the regions within the subcontinent were
not isolated from one another, so too, contact with
lands beyond the seas and mountains had existed
for millennia. Arab merchants, for instance,
frequented ports along the western coast in the first
millennium CE, while Central Asian people settled
in the north-western parts of the subcontinent
during the same period. From the seventh century,
with the advent of Islam, these regions became part
of what is often termed the Islamic world.

establishment of the Mughal Empire in the sixteenth
century as well as in many of the regional states that
emerged in the eighteenth century.

5.2 The popular practice of Islam
The developments that followed the coming of Islam
were not confined to ruling elites; in fact they
permeated far and wide, through the subcontinent,
amongst different social strata – peasants, artisans,
warriors, merchants, to name a few. All those who
adopted Islam accepted, in principle, the five “pillars”
of the faith: that there is one God, Allah, and Prophet
Muhammad is his messenger (shahada); offering
prayers five times a day (namaz/salat ); giving alms
(zakat ); fasting during the month of Ramzan (sawm );
and performing the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj ).

However, these universal features were often
overlaid with diversities in practice derived from
sectarian affiliations (Sunni, Shi‘a), and the influence
of local customary practices of converts from different
social milieus. For example, the Khojahs, a branch Fig. 6.8

route linking Delhi and Gujarat, it attracted a lot

By the sixteenth century the shrine had become
very popular; in fact it was the spirited singing of
pilgrims bound for Ajmer that inspired Akbar
to visit the tomb. He went there fourteen times,
sometimes two or three times a year, to seek
blessings for new conquests, fulfilment of vows, and
the birth of sons. He maintained this tradition until
1580. Each of these visits was celebrated by
generous gifts, which were recorded in imperial
documents. For example, in 1568 he offered a huge
cauldron (degh) to facilitate cooking for pilgrims.
He also had a mosque constructed within the
compound of the dargah.

7.4 Sufis and the state
A major feature of the Chishti tradition was austerity,
including maintaining a distance from worldly
power. However, this was by no means a situation of
absolute isolation from political power. The sufis
accepted unsolicited grants and donations from the
political elites. The Sultans in turn set up charitable
trusts (auqaf ) as endowments for hospices and
granted tax-free land (inam).

The Chishtis accepted donations in cash and kind.
Rather than accumulate donations, they preferred
to use these fully on immediate requirements
such as food, clothes, living quarters and ritual
necessities (such as sama‘ ). All this enhanced the
moral authority of the shaikhs, which in turn
attracted people from all walks of life. Further, their
piety and scholarship, and people’s belief in their
miraculous powers made sufis popular among the
masses, whose support kings wished to secure.

Kings did not simply need to demonstrate their
association with sufis; they also required legitimation
from them. When the Turks set up the Delhi
Sultanate, they resisted the insistence of the ulama
on imposing shari‘a as state law because they
anticipated opposition from their subjects, the
majority of whom were non-Muslims. The Sultans
then sought out the sufis – who derived their
authority directly from God – and did not depend on
jurists to interpret the shari‘a.

Besides, it was believed that the auliya could
intercede with God in order to improve the material Sufis and the state

words: expressions such as “the lotus which blooms

Also striking is the range of traditions Kabir drew
on to describe the Ultimate Reality. These include
Islam: he described the Ultimate Reality as Allah,
Khuda, Hazrat and Pir. He also used terms drawn
from Vedantic traditions, alakh (the unseen), nirakar
(formless), Brahman, Atman, etc. Other terms with
mystical connotations such as shabda (sound) or
shunya (emptiness) were drawn from yogic traditions.

expressed in these poems. Some poems draw on
Islamic ideas and use monotheism and iconoclasm
to attack Hindu polytheism and idol worship; others
use the sufi concept of zikr and ishq (love) to express
the Hindu practice of nam-simaran (remembrance

This is most evident in later
debates about whether he was

seventeenth century onwards,

to suggest that he was born a
Hindu, Kabirdas (Kabir itself is
an Arabic word meaning “great”),
but was raised by a poor
Muslim family belonging to
the community of weavers or
julahas, who were relatively
recent converts to Islam. They
also suggested that he was
initiated into bhakti by a guru,
perhaps Ramananda.

However, the verses attributed to Kabir use the
words guru and satguru, but do not mention the name
of any specific preceptor. Historians have pointed
out that it is very difficult to establish that
Ramananda and Kabir were contemporaries, without
assigning improbably long lives to either or both.
So, while traditions linking the two cannot be
accepted at face value, they show how important
the legacy of Kabir was for later generations.

8.2 Baba Guru Nanak and the Sacred Word
Baba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) was born in a Hindu
merchant family in a village called Nankana Sahib
near the river Ravi in the predominantly Muslim
Punjab. He trained to be an accountant and studied
Persian. He was married at a young age but he spent
most of his time among sufis and bhaktas. He also
travelled widely.

The message of Baba Guru Nanak is spelt out in
his hymns and teachings. These suggest that he
advocated a form of nirguna bhakti. He firmly
repudiated the external practices of the religions he
saw around him. He rejected sacrifices, ritual baths,
image worship, austerities and the scriptures of both
Hindus and Muslims. For Baba Guru Nanak,
the Absolute or “rab” had no gender or form. He
proposed a simple way to connect to the Divine by
remembering and repeating the Divine Name,
expressing his ideas through hymns called “shabad”
in Punjabi, the language of the region. Baba Guru
Nanak would sing these compositions in various
ragas while his attendant Mardana played the rabab.

Baba Guru Nanak organised his followers into a
community. He set up rules for congregational
worship (sangat ) involving collective recitation. He
appointed one of his disciples, Angad, to succeed
him as the preceptor (guru), and this practice was
followed for nearly 200 years.

It appears that Baba Guru Nanak did not
wish to establish a new religion, but after his death
his followers consolidated their own practices
and distinguished themselves from both Hindus
and Muslims. The fifth preceptor, Guru Arjan,
compiled Baba Guru Nanak’s hymns along with
those of his four successors and other religious
poets like Baba Farid, Ravidas (also known as
Raidas) and Kabir in the Adi Granth Sahib. These
hymns, called “gurbani”, are composed in various

preceptor, Guru Gobind Singh, included the
compositions of the ninth guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur,
and this scripture was called the Guru Granth Sahib.
Guru Gobind Singh also laid the foundation of the
Khalsa Panth (army of the pure) and defined its five
symbols: uncut hair, a dagger, a pair of shorts, a comb
and a steel bangle. Under him the community got

8.3 Mirabai, the devotee princess
Mirabai (c. fifteenth-sixteenth centuries) is perhaps
the best-known woman poet within the bhakti
tradition. Biographies have been reconstructed
primarily from the bhajans attributed to her, which
were transmitted orally for centuries. According to
these, she was a Rajput princess from Merta in

Varieties of sources used to reconstruct
the history of sufi traditions

A wide range of texts were produced in and around sufi khanqahs.
These included:

1.Treatises or manuals dealing with sufi  thought and
practices  The Kashf-ul-Mahjub of Ali bin Usman Hujwiri (died
c. 1071) is an example of this genre. It enables historians to see
how traditions outside the subcontinent influenced sufi thought
in India.

2. Malfuzat (literally,  uttered; conversations of sufi saints) 
An early text on malfuzat is the Fawaid-al-Fuad, a collection of
conversations of Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliya, compiled by Amir
Hasan Sijzi Dehlavi, a noted Persian poet. Source 9 contains an
excerpt from this text. Malfuzats were compiled by different sufi
silsilas with the permission of the shaikhs; these had obvious
didactic purposes. Several examples have been found from
different parts of the subcontinent, including the Deccan. They
were compiled over several centuries.

3. Maktubat (literally, written collections of letters); letters
written by sufi masters, addressed to their disciples and
associates  While these tell us about the shaikhs experience
of religious truth that he wanted to share with others, they
also reflect the life conditions of the recipients and are responses
to their aspirations and difficulties, both spiritual and mundane.
The letters, known as Maktubat-i Imam Rabbani, of the noted
seventeenth-century Naqshbandi Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi
(d.1624), whose ideology is often contrasted with the liberal
and non-sectarian views of Akbar, are amongst those most
frequently discussed by scholars.

4. Tazkiras (literally, to mention and memorialise; biographical
accounts of saints)  The fourteenth-centurySiyar-ul-Auliya of
Mir Khwurd Kirmani was the first sufi tazkira written in India.
It dealt principally with the Chishti saints. The most famous tazkira
is the Akhbar-ul-Akhyar of Abdul Haqq Muhaddis Dehlavi
(d. 1642). The authors of the tazkiras often sought to establish
the precedence of their own orders and glorify their  spiritual
genealogies. Many details are often implausible, full of elements
of the fantastic. Still they are of great value for historians and
help them to understand more fully the nature of the tradition.

 Remember that each of the traditions we have been considering
in this chapter generated a wide range of textual and oral modes
of communication, some of which have been preserved, many
of which have been modified in the process of transmission, and
others are probably lost forever.

BHAKTI-SUFI TRADITIONS 167

Virtually all these religious traditions continue to
flourish to date. This continuity has certain
advantages for historians as it allows them to compare
contemporary practices with those described in textual
traditions or shown in old paintings  and to trace
changes.  At the same time, because these traditions
are part of peoples’ lived beliefs and practices, there
is often a lack of acceptance of the possibility that
these may have changed over time.  The challenge for
historians is to undertake such investigations with
sensitivity, while at the same time recognising that
religious traditions, like other traditions, are dynamic
and change over time.

SEVEN Vijayanagara

(c. fourteenth to sixteenth century)

Vijayanagara or “city of victory” was the name of
both a city and an empire. The empire was founded
in the fourteenth century. In its heyday it stretched
from the river Krishna in the north to the extreme
south of the peninsula. In 1565 the city was sacked
and subsequently deserted. Although it fell into
ruin in the seventeenth-eighteenth centuries, it
lived on in the memories of people living in the
Krishna-Tungabhadra doab. They remembered it
as Hampi, a name derived from that of the local
mother goddess, Pampadevi. These oral traditions
combined with archaeological finds, monuments
and inscriptions and other records helped scholars
to rediscover the Vijayanagara Empire.

1. The Discovery of Hampi
The ruins at Hampi were brought to light in 1800 by
an engineer and antiquarian named Colonel Colin
Mackenzie. An employee of the English East India
Company, he prepared the first survey map of the
site. Much of the initial information he received was
based on the memories of priests of the Virupaksha
temple and the shrine of Pampadevi. Subsequently,
from 1856, photographers began to record the
monuments which enabled scholars to study them.
As early as 1836 epigraphists began collecting
several dozen inscriptions found at this and other
temples at Hampi. In an effort to reconstruct the
history of the city and the empire, historians collated
information from these sources with accounts of
foreign travellers and other literature written in
Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Sanskrit.

Born in 1754, Colin Mackenzie became famous as an
engineer, surveyor and cartographer. In 1815 he was
appointed the first Surveyor General of India, a post
he held till his death in 1821. He embarked on collecting
local histories and surveying historic sites in order to
better understand Indias past and make governance of
the colony easier. He says that it struggled long under
the miseries of bad management  before the South

believed that the East India Company could gain much

2.3 The rayas and the nayakas
Among those who exercised power in the empire were
military chiefs who usually controlled forts and had
armed supporters. These chiefs often moved from
one area to another, and in many cases were
accompanied by peasants looking for fertile land on
which to settle. These chiefs were known as nayakas
and they usually spoke Telugu or Kannada. Many
nayakas submitted to the authority of the kings of
Vijayanagara but they often rebelled and had to be
subdued by military action.

The amara-nayaka system was a major political
innovation of the Vijayanagara Empire. It is likely
that many features of this system were derived from
the iqta system of the Delhi Sultanate.

The amara-nayakas were military commanders
who were given territories to govern by the raya.
They collected taxes and other dues from peasants,
craftspersons and traders in the area. They retained
part of the revenue for personal use and for
maintaining a stipulated contingent of horses
and elephants. These contingents provided the
Vijayanagara kings with an effective fighting force
with which they brought the entire southern
peninsula under their control. Some of the revenue
was also used for the maintenance of temples and
irrigation works.

present-day archaeologists, who have also found
evidence of an agricultural tract between the sacred
centre and the urban core. This tract was serviced
by an elaborate canal system drawing water from
the Tungabhadra.

Why do you think agricultural tracts were
incorporated within the fortified area? Often, the
objective of medieval sieges was to starve the
defenders into submission. These sieges could last
for several months and sometimes even years.

grew continually through interaction with local

Archaeologists have studied roads within the city

identified by tracing paths through gateways, as well
as by finds of pavements. Roads generally wound
around through the valleys, avoiding rocky terrain.
Some of the most important roads extended from
temple gateways, and were lined by bazaars.

core and suggest that these areas may have been
occupied by rich traders. This was also the Muslim
residential quarter. Tombs and mosques located
here have distinctive functions, yet their architecture
resembles that of the mandapas found in the temples
of Hampi.

This is how the sixteenth-century Portuguese
traveller Barbosa described the houses of ordinary
people, which have not survived: “The other houses

and arranged according to occupations, in long

Field surveys indicate that the entire area was

pointing to the prevalence of a variety of cults,
perhaps supported by different communities. The
surveys also indicate that wells, rainwater tanks as
well as temple tanks may have served as sources of
water to the ordinary town dwellers.

the sacrifice of buffaloes and other animals. Dances,
wrestling matches, and processions of caparisoned
horses, elephants and chariots and soldiers, as well
as ritual presentations before the king and his

with deep symbolic meanings. On the last day of the

of the nayakas in a grand ceremony in an open field.
On this occasion the nayakas brought rich gifts for

Was the “mahanavami dibba” that stands today

5. The Sacred Centre

5.1 Choosing a capital
We now move to the rocky northern end of the city
on the banks of the Tungabhadra. According to local
tradition, these hills sheltered the monkey kingdom
of Vali and Sugriva mentioned in the Ramayana.
Other traditions suggest that Pampadevi, the local
mother goddess, did penance in these hills in order
to marry Virupaksha, the guardian deity of the
kingdom, also recognised as a form of Shiva. To this
day this marriage is celebrated annually in the
Virupaksha temple. Among these hills are found
Jaina temples of the pre-Vijayanagara period as well.
In other words, this area was associated with several
sacred traditions.

Temple building in the region had a long history,
going back to dynasties such as the Pallavas,
Chalukyas, Hoysalas and Cholas. Rulers very often
encouraged temple building as a means of
associating themselves with the divine – often, the
deity was explicitly or implicitly identified with the
king. Temples also functioned as centres of learning.
Besides, rulers and others often granted land and
other resources for the maintenance of temples.
Consequently, temples developed as significant
religious, social, cultural and economic centres. From
the point of view of the rulers, constructing, repairing
and maintaining temples were important means
of winning support and recognition for their power,
wealth and piety.

It is likely that the very choice of the site of
Vijayanagara was inspired by the existence of the
shrines of Virupaksha and Pampadevi. In fact the
Vijayanagara kings claimed to rule on behalf of
the god Virupaksha. All royal orders were signed
“Shri Virupaksha”, usually in the Kannada script.
Rulers also indicated their close links with the gods
by using the title “Hindu Suratrana”. This was a
Sanskritisation of the Arabic term Sultan, meaning
king, so it literally meant Hindu Sultan.

Even as they drew on earlier traditions, the rulers
of Vijayanagara innovated and developed these.
Royal portrait sculpture was now displayed in
temples, and the king’s visits to temples were treated
as important state occasions on which he was
accompanied by the important nayakas of the empire.

the resources, techniques and skills needed to
construct these towering gateways. Other distinctive
features include mandapas or pavilions and
long, pillared corridors that often ran around the
shrines within the temple complex. Let us look at
two temples more closely – the Virupaksha temple
and the Vitthala temple.

The Virupaksha temple was built over centuries.
While inscriptions suggest that the earliest
shrine dated to the ninth-tenth centuries, it was
substantially enlarged with the establishment
of the Vijayanagara Empire. The hall in front of
the main shrine was built by Krishnadeva Raya to
mark his accession. This was decorated with
delicately carved pillars. He is also credited with

Reprint 2025-26



AN IMPERIAL CAPITAL: VIJAYANAGARA 187

the construction of the eastern gopuram. These
additions meant that the central shrine came to
occupy a relatively small part of the complex.

The halls in the temple were used for a variety of
purposes. Some were spaces in which the images of
gods were placed to witness special programmes of
music, dance, drama, etc. Others were used to
celebrate the marriages of deities, and yet others
were meant for the deities to swing in. Special images,
distinct from those kept in the small central shrine,
were used on these occasions.

188  THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  PART II

Another shrine, the Vitthala temple, is also
interesting. Here, the principal deity was Vitthala, a
form of Vishnu generally worshipped in Maharashtra.
The introduction of the worship of the deity in
Karnataka is another indication of the ways in which
the rulers of Vijayanagara drew on different traditions
to create an imperial culture. As in the case of other
temples, this temple too has several halls and a
unique shrine designed as a chariot (Fig. 7.24).

A characteristic feature of the temple complexes
is the chariot streets that extended from the temple
gopuram in a straight line. These streets were paved
with stone slabs and lined with pillared pavilions in
which merchants set up their shops.

Just as the nayakas continued with and elaborated
on traditions of fortification, so they did with
traditions of temple building. In fact, some of the
most spectacular gopurams were also built by the
local nayakas.

6. Plotting Palaces, Temples
and Bazaars

We have been examining a wealth of information on
Vijayanagara – photographs, plans, elevations of
structures and sculpture. How was all of this
produced? After the initial surveys by Mackenzie,
information was pieced together from travellers’
accounts and inscriptions. Through the twentieth
century, the site was preserved by the Archaeological
Survey of India and the Karnataka Department of
Archaeology and Museums. In 1976, Hampi was
recognised as a site of national importance. Then,
in the early 1980s, an important project was
launched to document the material remains at
Vijayanagara in detail, through extensive and
intensive surveys, using a variety of recording
techniques. Over nearly twenty years, dozens of

Reprint 2025-26



AN IMPERIAL CAPITAL: VIJAYANAGARA 189

scholars from all over the
world worked to compile and
preserve this information.

Let us look at just one
part of this enormous
exercise – mapping – in
more detail. The first step
was to divide the entire
area into a set of 25
squares, each designated by
a letter of the alphabet. Then,
each of the small squares
was subdivided into a set
of even smaller squares. But
this was not all: each of
these smaller squares was
further subdivided into yet
smaller units.

As you can see, these
detailed surveys have
been extremely painstaking,
and have recovered and
documented traces of
thousands of structures –
from tiny shrines and
residences to elaborate
temples. They have also led
to the recovery of traces of
roads, paths, bazaars, etc.

It is worth remembering
something that John M. Fritz,

site, wrote: “In our study of these
monuments of Vijayanagara we
have to imagine a whole series
of vanished wooden elements –
columns, brackets, beams,
ceilings, overhanging eaves, and
towers – decorated with plaster
and painted, perhaps brightly.”

Although wooden structures are
lost, and only stone structures
survive, the descriptions left by
travellers allow us to reconstruct
some aspects of the vibrant life of
the times.

The bazaar

Paes gives a vivid description of the bazaar:

Going forward, you have a broad and beautiful street
 In this street live many merchants, and there you
will find all sorts of rubies, and diamonds, and emeralds,
and pearls, and seed-pearls, and cloths, and every other
sort of thing there is on earth and that you may wish to
buy. Then you have there every evening a fair where
they sell many common horses and nags, and also many
citrons, and limes, and oranges, and grapes, and every
other kind of garden stuff, and wood; you have all in
this street.

 More generally, he described the city as being the best-
provided city in the world with the markets stocked with
provisions such as rice, wheat, grains, India corn and a
certain amount of barley and beans, moong, pulses
and horse-gram all of which were cheaply and abundantly
available. According to Fernao Nuniz, the Vijayanagara
markets were overflowing with abundance of fruits,
grapes and oranges, limes, pomegranates, jackfruit and
mangoes and all very cheap. Meat too was sold in
abundance in the marketplaces. Nuniz describes mutton,
pork, venison, partridges, hares, doves, quail and all kinds
of birds, sparrows, rats and cats and lizards as being
sold in the market of Bisnaga (Vijayanagara).

Buildings that survive tell us about the way spaces
were organised and used, how they were built, with
what materials and techniques. For example, we
can assess the defence requirements and military
preparedness of a city by studying its fortifications.
Buildings also tell us about the spread of ideas and
cultural influences if we compare them with
buildings in other places. They convey ideas which
the builders or their patrons wished to project. They
are often suffused with symbols which are a product
of their cultural context. These we can understand
when we combine information from other sources

Agrarian Society and the Mughal Empire

(c. sixteenth - seventeenth centuries)

During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
about 85 per cent of the population of India lived in
its villages. Both peasants and landed elites were
involved in agricultural production and claimed
rights to a share of the produce. This created
relationships of cooperation, competition and
conflict among them. The sum of these agrarian
relationships made up rural society.

At the same time agencies from outside also
entered into the rural world. Most important among
these was the Mughal state, which derived the
bulk of its income from agricultural production.
Agents of the state – revenue assessors, collectors,
record keepers – sought to control rural society so
as to ensure that cultivation took place and the
state got its regular share of taxes from the

1. Peasants and Agricultural
Production

The basic unit of agricultural society was the village,
inhabited by peasants who performed the manifold
seasonal tasks that made up agricultural production
throughout the year – tilling the soil, sowing seeds,
harvesting the crop when it was ripe. Further, they
contributed their labour to the production of
agro-based goods such as sugar and oil.

But rural India was not characterised by settled
peasant production alone. Several kinds of areas
such as large tracts of dry land or hilly regions were
not cultivable in the same way as the more fertile

PEASANTS, ZAMINDARS AND THE STATE 197

expanses of land. In addition, forest areas made up
a substantial proportion of territory. We need to keep
this varied topography in mind when discussing
agrarian society.

1.1 Looking for sources
Our understanding of the workings of rural society does
not come from those who worked the land, as peasants
did not write about themselves. Our major source for
the agrarian history of the sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries are chronicles and documents
from the Mughal court (see also Chapter 9).

One of the most important chronicles was the
Ain-i Akbari (in short the Ain, see also Section 8)
authored by Akbar’s court historian Abu’l Fazl. This
text meticulously recorded the arrangements made
by the state to ensure cultivation, to enable the
collection of revenue by the agencies of the state
and to regulate the relationship between the state
and rural magnates, the zamindars.

The central purpose of the Ain was to present a
vision of Akbar’s empire where social harmony was
provided by a strong ruling class. Any revolt or assertion
of autonomous power against the Mughal state was,
in the eyes of the author of the Ain, predestined to fail.
In other words, whatever we learn from the Ain about
peasants remains a view from the top.

Fortunately, however, the account of the Ain can
be supplemented by descriptions contained in sources
emanating from regions away from the Mughal
capital. These include detailed revenue records from
Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan dating from
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Further,
the extensive records of the East India Company (see
also Chapter 10) provide us with useful descriptions
of agrarian relations in eastern India. All these
sources record instances of conflicts between
peasants, zamindars and the state. In the process
they give us an insight into peasants’ perception of
and their expectations of fairness from the state.

1.2 Peasants and their lands
The term which Indo-Persian sources of the Mughal
period most frequently used to denote a peasant was
raiyat (plural, riaya) or muzarian. In addition, we
also encounter the terms kisan or asami.  Sources of
the seventeenth century refer to two kinds of
peasants – khud-kashta and pahi-kashta. The former

2. The Village Community
The above account makes it clear that agricultural
production involved the intensive participation and
initiative of the peasantry. How did this affect the
structure of agrarian relations in Mughal society?
To find out, let us look at the social groups involved
in agricultural expansion, and at their relationships
and conflicts.

We have seen that peasants held their lands in
individual ownership. At the same time they belonged
to a collective village community as far as many
aspects of their social existence were concerned.

communities too. In Muslim communities menials like
the halalkhoran (scavengers) were housed outside the
boundaries of the village; similarly the mallahzadas
(literally, sons of boatmen) in Bihar were comparable
to slaves.

There was a direct correlation between caste,
poverty and social status at the lower strata of
society. Such correlations were not so marked at
intermediate levels. In a manual from seventeenth-
century Marwar, Rajputs are mentioned as peasants,
sharing the same space with Jats, who were accorded
a lower status in the caste hierarchy. The Gauravas,
who cultivated land around Vrindavan (Uttar
Pradesh), sought Rajput status in the seventeenth
century. Castes such as the Ahirs, Gujars and Malis
rose in the hierarchy because of the profitability of
cattle rearing and horticulture. In the eastern
regions, intermediate pastoral and fishing castes
like the Sadgops and Kaivartas acquired the status
of peasants.

2.2 Panchayats and headmen
The village panchayat was an assembly of elders,
usually important people of the village with hereditary
rights over their property. In mixed-caste villages,
the panchayat was usually a heterogeneous body. An
oligarchy, the panchayat represented various castes
and communities in the village, though the village
menial-cum-agricultural worker was unlikely to be
represented there. The decisions made by these
panchayats were binding on the members.

The panchayat was headed by a headman known
as muqaddam or mandal. Some sources suggest that
the headman was chosen through the consensus of
the village elders, and that this choice had to be
ratified by the zamindar. Headmen held office as long

natural calamities (like
floods), were also met from
these funds. Often these
funds were also deployed in
construction of a bund or
digging a canal which
peasants usually could not
afford to do on their own.

One important function of
the panchayat was to ensure
that caste boundaries among
the various communities
inhabiting the village were
upheld. In eastern India all
marriages were held in the

limited period. It meant that a person forced to leave
the village became an outcaste and lost his right
to practise his profession. Such a measure was
intended as a deterrent to violation of caste norms.

In addition to the village panchayat each caste
or jati in the village had its own jati panchayat.
These panchayats wielded considerable power
in rural society. In Rajasthan jati panchayats
arbitrated civil disputes between members of
different castes. They mediated in contested claims
on land, decided whether marriages were performed
according to the norms laid down by a particular
caste group, determined who had ritual precedence
in village functions, and so on. In most cases,
except in matters of criminal justice, the state
respected the decisions of jati panchayats.

Archival records from western India – notably
Rajasthan and Maharashtra – contain petitions
presented to the panchayat complaining about
extortionate taxation or the demand for unpaid
labour (begar) imposed by the “superior” castes or
officials of the state. These petitions were usually
made by villagers, from the lowest rungs of rural
society. Often petitions were made collectively as

conflicts between “lower -caste”
peasants and state officials or the
local zamindar could vary from
case to case. In cases of excessive
revenue demands, the panchayat
often suggested compromise. In
cases where reconciliation failed,
peasants took recourse to more
drastic forms of resistance, such as
deserting the village. The relatively
easy availability of uncultivated land
and the competition over labour
resources made this an effective
weapon in the hands of cultivators.

2.3 Village artisans
Another interesting aspect of
the village was the elaborate
relationship of exchange between
different producers. Marathi
documents and village surveys
made in the early years of British
rule have revealed the existence of
substantial numbers of artisans,
sometimes as high as 25 per cent of
the total households in the villages.

At times, however, the distinction
between artisans and peasants in
village society was a fluid one, as
many groups performed the tasks
of both. Cultivators and their
families would also participate in
craft production – such as dyeing,
textile printing, baking and firing
of pottery, making and repairing

Reprint 2025-26



PEASANTS, ZAMINDARS AND THE STATE 205

agricultural implements. Phases in the agricultural
calendar when there was a relative lull in activity,
as between sowing and weeding or between weeding
and harvesting, were a time when cultivators could
engage in artisanal production.

Village artisans – potters, blacksmiths, carpenters,
barbers, even goldsmiths – provided specialised
services in return for which they were compensated
by villagers by a variety of means. The most common
way of doing so was by giving them a share of the
harvest, or an allotment of land, perhaps cultivable
wastes, which was likely to be decided by the
panchayat. In Maharashtra such lands became the
artisans’ miras or watan – their hereditary holding.

Another variant of this was a system where
artisans and individual peasant households entered
into a mutually negotiated system of remuneration,
most of the time goods for services. For example,
eighteenth-century records tell us of zamindars in
Bengal who remunerated blacksmiths, carpenters,
even goldsmiths for their work by paying them “a
small daily allowance and diet money”. This later
came to be described as the jajmani system,
though the term was not in vogue in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. Such evidence is
interesting because it indicates the intricate ways
in which exchange networks operated at the
micro-level of the village. Cash remuneration was
not entirely unknown either.

2.4  A “little republic”?
How does one understand the significance of the
village community? Some British officials in the
nineteenth century saw the village as a “little
republic” made up of fraternal partners sharing
resources and labour in a collective. However, this
was not a sign of rural egalitarianism. There was
individual ownership of assets and deep inequities
based on caste and gender distinctions. A group
of powerful individuals decided the affairs of the
village, exploited the weaker sections and had the
authority to dispense justice.

More importantly, a cash nexus had already
developed through trade between villages and towns.
In the Mughal heartland too, revenue was assessed
and collected in cash. Artisans producing for the
export market (for example, weavers) received their

the production process often involves men and
women performing certain specified roles. In the
contexts that we are exploring, women and men had
to work shoulder to shoulder in the fields. Men
tilled and ploughed, while women sowed, weeded,
threshed and winnowed the harvest. With the growth
of nucleated villages and expansion in individuated
peasant farming, which characterised medieval
Indian agriculture, the basis of production was the
labour and resources of the entire household.
Naturally, a gendered segregation between the home
(for women) and the world (for men) was not possible
in this context. Nonetheless biases related to women’s
biological functions did continue. Menstruating

plough or the potter’s wheel in western India, or
enter the groves where betel-leaves (paan) were

Artisanal tasks such as spinning yarn, sifting and
kneading clay for pottery, and embroidery were among
the many aspects of production dependent on female
labour. The more commercialised the product, the
greater the demand on women’s labour to produce it.
In fact, peasant and artisan women worked not only
in the fields, but even went to the houses of their
employers or to the markets if necessary.

Women were considered an important resource in
agrarian society also because they were child bearers
in a society dependent on labour. At the same time,
high mortality rates among women – owing to
malnutrition, frequent pregnancies, death during
childbirth – often meant a shortage of wives. This
led to the emergence of social customs in peasant

Fig. 8.7
A woman spinning thread and artisan communities that were distinct from

PEASANTS, ZAMINDARS AND THE STATE 207

those prevalent among elite groups. Marriages in
many rural communities required the payment of
bride-price rather than dowry to the bride’s family.
Remarriage was considered legitimate both among
divorced and widowed women.

The importance attached to women as a
reproductive force also meant that the fear of losing
control over them was great. According to established
social norms, the household was headed by a male.
Thus women were kept under strict control by the
male members of the family and the community.
They could inflict draconian punishments if they
suspected infidelity on the part of women.

Documents from Western India – Rajasthan, Gujarat
and Maharashtra – record petitions sent by women to
the village panchayat, seeking redress and justice.
Wives protested against the infidelity of their
husbands or the neglect of the wife and children by
the male head of the household, the grihasthi. While
male infidelity was not always punished, the state
and “superior” caste groups did intervene when it came
to ensuring that the family was adequately provided
for. In most cases when women petitioned to the Fig. 8.8 a

Amongst the landed gentry, women had the right
to inherit property. Instances from the Punjab show
that women, including widows, actively participated
in the rural land market as sellers of property inherited
by them. Hindu and Muslim women inherited
zamindaris which they were free to sell or mortgage.
Women zamindars were known in eighteenth-century
Bengal. In fact, one of the biggest and most famous of
the eighteenth-century zamindaris, that of Rajshahi,
had a woman at the helm.

not mean an absence of “civilisation”,
as popular usage of the term today
seems to connote. Rather, the term
described those whose livelihood
came from the gathering of forest
produce, hunting and shifting
agriculture. These activities were
largely season specific. Among the
Bhils, for example, spring was reserved
for collecting forest produce, summer
for fishing, the monsoon months
for cultivation, and autumn and
winter for hunting. Such a sequence
presumed and perpetuated mobility,
which was a distinctive feature of
tribes inhabiting these forests.

For the state, the forest was a
subversive place – a place of refuge
(mawas) for troublemakers. Once
again, we turn to Babur who says that
jungles provided a good defence “behind

4.2 Inroads into forests
External forces entered the forest in

required elephants for the army. So

often included a supply of elephants.

of overseas export from India in the seventeenth
century. Elephants were also captured and sold.
Trade involved an exchange of commodities through
barter as well. Some tribes, like the Lohanis in the
Punjab, were engaged in overland trade, between
India and Afghanistan, and in the town-country
trade in the Punjab itself.

Social factors too wrought changes in the lives of
forest dwellers. Like the “big men” of the village
community, tribes also had their chieftains. Many
tribal chiefs had become zamindars, some even
became kings. For this they required to build up an
army. They recruited people from their lineage
groups or demanded that their fraternity provide
military service. Tribes in the Sind region had armies
comprising 6,000 cavalry and 7,000 infantry. In
Assam, the Ahom kings had their paiks, people who
were obliged to render military service in exchange
for land. The capture of wild elephants was declared
a royal monopoly by the Ahom kings.

 New cultural influences also began to penetrate
into forested zones. Some historians have indeed
suggested that sufi saints (pirs) played a major role
in the slow acceptance of Islam among agricultural
communities emerging in newly colonised places
(see also Chapter 6).

5. The Zamindars
Our story of agrarian relations in Mughal India will
not be complete without referring to a class of
people in the countryside that lived off agriculture
but did not participate directly in the processes of
agricultural production. These were the zamindars
who were landed proprietors who also enjoyed certain
social and economic privileges by virtue of their
superior status in rural society. Caste was one factor
that accounted for the elevated status of zamindars;
another factor was that they performed certain
services (khidmat) for the state.

The zamindars held extensive personal lands
termed milkiyat, meaning property. Milkiyat lands
were cultivated for the private use of zamindars,
often with the help of hired or servile labour. The
zamindars could sell, bequeath or mortgage these
lands at will.

Zamindars also derived their power from the fact
that they could often collect revenue on behalf of
the state, a service for which they were compensated
financially. Control over military resources was
another source of power. Most zamindars had
fortresses (qilachas) as well as an armed contingent
comprising units of cavalry, artillery and infantry.

Thus if we visualise social relations in the
Mughal countryside as a pyramid, zamindars clearly
constituted its very narrow apex. Abu’l Fazl’s account
indicates that an “upper-caste”, Brahmana-Rajput

212  THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  PART II

combine had already established firm control
over rural society. It also reflects a fairly large
representation from the so-called intermediate castes,
as we saw earlier, as well as a liberal sprinkling of
Muslim zamindaris.

Contemporary documents give an impression that
conquest may have been the source of the origin of
some zamindaris. The dispossession of weaker people
by a powerful military chieftain was quite often a
way of expanding a zamindari. It is, however, unlikely
that the state would have allowed such a show of
aggression by a zamindar unless he had been
confirmed by an imperial order (sanad ).

More important were the slow processes of
zamindari consolidation, which are also documented
in sources. These involved colonisation of new lands,
by transfer of rights, by order of the state and by

cannons, and 4,500 boats. For example, the Rajputs and Jats adopted these

strategies to consolidate their control over vast
swathes of territory in northern India. Likewise,
peasant-pastoralists (like the Sadgops) carved out
powerful zamindaris in areas of central and south-
western Bengal.

Zamindars spearheaded the colonisation of
agricultural land, and helped in settling cultivators
by providing them with the means of cultivation,
including cash loans. The buying and selling of
zamindaris accelerated the process of monetisation
in the countryside. In addition, zamindars sold the
produce from their milkiyat lands. There is evidence
to show that zamindars often established markets (haats)
to which peasants also came to sell their produce.

Although there can be little doubt that zamindars
were an exploitative class, their relationship with the
peasantry had an element of reciprocity, paternalism
and patronage. Two aspects reinforce this view. First,
the bhakti saints, who eloquently condemned
caste-based and other forms of oppression (see also
Chapter 6), did not portray the zamindars (or,
interestingly, the moneylender) as exploiters or
oppressors of the peasantry. Usually it was the

6. Land Revenue System
Revenue from the land was the economic mainstay
of the Mughal Empire. It was therefore vital for the
state to create an administrative apparatus to ensure
control over agricultural production, and to fix and
collect revenue from across the length and breadth
of the rapidly expanding empire. This apparatus
included the office (daftar) of the diwan who was
responsible for supervising the fiscal system of the
empire. Thus revenue officials and record keepers
penetrated the agricultural domain and became a
decisive agent in shaping agrarian relations.

The Mughal state tried to first acquire specific
information about the extent of the agricultural
lands in the empire and what these lands produced
before fixing the burden of taxes on people. The
land revenue arrangements consisted of two
stages – first, assessment and then actual collection.
The jama was the amount assessed, as opposed to
hasil, the amount collected. In his list of duties of
the amil-guzar or revenue collector, Akbar decreed
that while he should strive to make cultivators pay
in cash, the option of payment in kind was also to
be kept open. While fixing revenue, the attempt of
the state was to maximise its claims. The scope of
actually realising these claims was, however,
sometimes thwarted by local conditions.

Both cultivated and cultivable lands were measured
in each province. The Ain compiled the aggregates of
such lands during Akbar’s rule. Efforts to measure
lands continued under subsequent emperors. For
instance, in 1665, Aurangzeb expressly instructed his
revenue officials to prepare annual records of the
number of cultivators in each village (Source 7). Yet
not all areas were measured successfully. As we have
seen, forests covered huge areas of the subcontinent
and thus remained unmeasured.

7. The Flow of Silver
The Mughal Empire was among the large territorial
empires in Asia that had managed to consolidate power
and resources during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. These empires were the Ming (China),
Safavid (Iran) and Ottoman (Turkey). The political
stability achieved by all these empires helped create
vibrant networks of overland trade from China to the
Mediterranean Sea. Voyages of discovery and the
opening up of the New World resulted in a massive
expansion of Asia’s (particularly India’s) trade with

expansion in the commodity composition of this trade.
An expanding trade brought in huge amounts of silver
bullion into Asia to pay for goods procured from India,
and a large part of that bullion gravitated towards
India. This was good for India as it did not have
natural resources of silver. As a result, the period
between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries was
also marked by a remarkable stability in the
availability of metal currency, particularly the silver
rupya in India. This facilitated an unprecedented
expansion of minting of coins and the circulation of
money in the economy as well as the ability of the
Mughal state to extract taxes and revenue in cash.

This excerpt from Giovanni Careris account (based on Berniers account) gives an

8. The Ain-i Akbari of Abul
Fazl Allami

The Ain-i Akbari was the culmination of a large
historical, administrative project of classification
undertaken by Abu’l Fazl at the order of Emperor
Akbar. It was completed in 1598, the forty-second
regnal year of the emperor, after having gone through
five revisions. The Ain was part of a larger project
of history writing commissioned by Akbar. This
history, known as the Akbar Nama, comprised three
books. The first two provided a historical narrative.
We will look at these parts more closely in Chapter
9. The Ain-i Akbari, the third book, was organised
as a compendium of imperial regulations and a
gazetteer of the empire.

The Ain gives detailed accounts of the organisation
of the court, administration and army, the sources
of revenue and the physical layout of the provinces
of Akbar’s empire and the literary, cultural and
religious traditions of the people. Along with a
description of the various departments of Akbar’s
government and elaborate descriptions of the

218  THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  PART II

various provinces (subas) of the empire, the Ain
gives us intricate quantitative information of
those provinces.

Collecting and compiling this information
systematically was an important imperial exercise.
It informed the emperor about the varied and diverse
customs and practices prevailing across his
extensive territories. The Ain is therefore a mine of
information for us about the Mughal Empire during
Akbar’s reign. It is important, however, to keep in
mind that this is a view of the regions from the
centre, a view of society from its apex.

The Ain is made up of five books (daftars), of which
the first three books describe the administration.
The first book, called manzil-abadi, concerns the
imperial household and its maintenance. The second
book, sipah-abadi, covers the military and civil
administration and the establishment of servants.
This book includes notices and short biographical
sketches of imperial officials (mansabdars), learned
men, poets and artists.

Fig. 8.14 The third book, mulk-abadi, is the one which deals

has detailed statistical information, which includes
the geographic, topographic and economic profile of
all subas and their administrative and fiscal
divisions (sarkars, parganas and mahals), total
measured area, and assessed revenue ( jama ).

After setting out details at the suba level, the Ain
goes on to give a detailed picture of the sarkars below
the suba. This it does in the form of tables, which
have eight columns giving the following information:
(1) parganat/mahal; (2) qila (forts); (3) arazi and
zamin-i paimuda (measured area); (4) naqdi, revenue
assessed in cash; (5) suyurghal, grants of revenue  in
charity; (6) zamindars; columns 7 and 8 contain
details of the castes of these zamindars, and their
troops including their horsemen (sawar), foot-soldiers
(piyada) and elephants (fil ). The mulk-abadi gives a
fascinating, detailed and highly complex view of
agrarian society in northern India. The fourth and
fifth books (daftars) deal with the religious, literary
and cultural traditions of the people of India and also
contain a collection of Akbar’s “auspicious sayings”.

Moistening the rose garden of fortune

In this extract Abul Fazl gives a vivid account of how and from whom he
collected his information:

... to Abul Fazl, son of Mubarak  this sublime mandate was given.
Write with the pen of sincerity the account of the glorious events
and of our dominion-conquering victories  Assuredly, I spent much
labour and research in collecting the records and narratives of His
Majestys actions and I was a long time interrogating the servants of
the State and the old members of the illustrious family. I examined
both prudent, truth-speaking old men and active-minded, right-
actioned young ones and reduced their statements to writing. The
Royal commands were issued to the provinces, that those who from
old service remembered, with certainty or with adminicle of doubt,
the events of the past, should copy out the notes and memoranda
and transit them to the court. (Then) a second command shone forth
from the holy Presence-chamber; to wit  that the materials which
had been collected should be ... recited in the royal hearing, and
whatever might have to be written down afterwards, should be
introduced into the noble volume as a supplement, and that such
details as on account of the minuteness of the inquiries and the
minutae of affairs, (which) could not then be brought to an end,
should be inserted afterwards at my leisure.

Being relieved by this royal order  the interpreter of the Divine
ordinance  from the secret anxiety of my heart, I proceeded to
reduce into writing the rough draughts (drafts)which were void of
the grace of arrangement and style. I obtained the chronicle of
events beginning at the Nineteenth Year of the Divine Era, when
the Record Office was established by the enlightened intellect of
His Majesty, and from its rich pages, I gathered the accounts of
many events. Great pains too, were taken to procure the originals
or copies of most of the orders which had been issued to the
provinces from the Accession up to the present-day  I also took
much trouble to incorporate many of the reports which ministers
and high officials had submitted, about the affairs of the empire
and the events of foreign countries. And my labour-loving soul
was satiated by the apparatus of inquiry and research. I also exerted
myself energetically to collect the rough notes and memoranda of
sagacious and well-informed men. By these means, I constructed a
reservoir for irrigating and moistening the rose garden of fortune
(the Akbar Nama).

Another limitation of the Ain is the somewhat
skewed nature of the quantitative data.  Data were
not collected uniformly from all provinces. For
instance, while for many subas detailed information
was compiled about the caste composition of the
zamindars, such information is not available for
Bengal and Orissa. Further, while the fiscal data
from the subas is remarkable for its richness, some
equally vital parameters such as prices and wages
from these same areas are not as well documented.
The detailed list of prices and wages that the Ain
does provide is mainly derived from data pertaining
to areas in or around the imperial capital of Agra,
and is therefore of limited relevance for the rest of
the country.

These limitations notwithstanding, the Ain remains
an extraordinary document of its times. By providing
fascinating glimpses into the structure and
organisation of the Mughal Empire and by giving us
quantitative information about its products and

The Ain completely departed from this tradition as
it recorded information about the empire and the people
of India, and thus constitutes a benchmark for

The value of the Ain’s quantitative evidence is
uncontested where the study of agrarian relations
is concerned. But it is the information it contains on
people, their professions and trades and on the
imperial establishment and the grandees of the empire
which enables historians to reconstruct the social
fabric of India at that time.
