What's in a
Name?
A long long time ago, there was a
cowherd family in Tarakeshwar. Every
day Deba and Deep took the cows out for
grazing. They used to return in the late
evening together with all the cows.
One day, Deba asked: How do we know
that we have not lost any cows? They did
not know how to count.
What could Deba and Deep do?
1******
Their friend gave them an idea: When you
go out, make a mark on the wall for
each cow that leaves the gate. Then
when you come back, strike out one
mark from the wall each time a
cow re-enters the gate.
The next day they followed
their friend's idea, and all the
marks were struck out when
they came back home.
Did all the cows come back home?
After a few years, they
had many more cows. One
day, their wall had this
many marks when they left
home.
So, they had
COWS.
The next day they returned
with the cows. They struck
out one mark as each cow
re-entered the gate. Two marks were still left on the wall but they
didn't see any cows outside. They were worried.
Why were Deba and Deep worried?
How many cows had reached home?
shed
Deba and Deep quickly went to search for the missing cows and
found them in a nearby field. They all happily returned home
together!
Their friend Hemant had 36 cows and 23 sheep.
Help Hemant keep track of his cows and sheep by making marks like
Deba and Deep.

Teacher's Note: Encourage children to think of different strategies
to count large groups of objects without using numbers. They can
also use the above story as an activity where they can keep track of

THE STORY OF OUR NUMBERS
Tens of thousands of years ago, people started counting. They wanted to
keep records of their things. So they made marks on the walls of caves
and on the barks of trees.
Over time, they kept records of their things by making groups of 5, 10,
20, and 60.
Thousands of years ago, the ancient Indians created a method for
writing any number, however large, using only ten symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It was one of the most ingenious and creative inventions
in human history. It made possible the invention of TVs, computers,
mobile phones, and more. This method of writing numbers is now used
everywhere in every country in the world.
A very important part of this invention was the introduction and use of
the symbol "0" to mean "nothing". It is the number 0 that really made.
this system of writing numerals work!
Over the next few months, we will learn how to write all numbers, however
large, using just these ten symbols.

One day, Akbar and Birbal were walking in a garden. Many crows
were flying in the sky around them. Akbar was
curious to know how many crows there were.
He announced a prize for anyone who could find this out.
People were wondering how to count crows which kept
flying from one place to another. Akbar asked Birbal if he
could figure this out.
After thinking for a day, Birbal said "There are exactly Nine
Hundred and Sixty Three crows in our city".
Akbar was surprised and
asked Birbal, "How can you be
so sure"?
"You can get them counted,"
said Birbal.
"What if there are less?" asked Akbar.
"The other crows would have gone on a
holiday," said Birbal.
"What if there are more?" asked Akbar.
"Crows from other places would be visiting,
the city," said Birbal.
Akbar was happy with Birbal's reply
