A careful examination of reaction (7.3) in processes:

which hydrogen has been replaced by oxygen 2 HgO (s)   2 Hg (l) + O2 (g)	 (7.8)
prompted chemists to reinterpret oxidation (removal of oxygen from mercuric oxide )
in terms of removal of hydrogen from it and, 2 FeCl3 (aq) + H2 (g) →2 FeCl2 (aq) + 2 HCl(aq)
therefore, the scope of term oxidation was (7.9)
broadened to include the removal of hydrogen 
from a substance. The following illustration is (removal of electronegative element, chlorine

can also be cited as an oxidation reaction. CH2 = CH2 (g) + H2 (g) → H3C – CH3 (g) (7.10)

Mg (s) + Cl2 (g) → MgCl2 (s)	 (7.6) apparent by re-examining all the equations

Mg (s) + S (s) → MgS (s)	 (7.7) coined for this class of chemical reactions.

encouraged chemists to consider not only the species undergoing oxidation and

Reduction : Gain of electron(s) by any species.
Oxidising agent : Acceptor of electron(s).
Reducing agent : Donor of electron(s).

Problem 7.2  Justify that the reaction:
2 Na(s) + H2(g) →  2 NaH (s) is a redox 
change.
Solution
Since in the above reaction the compound 
formed is an ionic compound, which may 
also be represented as Na+H– (s), this 
suggests that one half reaction in this 
process is : 
2 Na (s)	 → 2 Na+(g)  +   2e–

The Paradox of Fractional Oxidation Number
Sometimes, we come across with certain compounds in which the oxidation number of a particular 
element in the compound is in fraction. Examples are:
C3O2 [where oxidation number of carbon  is (4/3)], 
Br3O8 [where oxidation number of bromine is (16/3)] 
and Na2S4O6 (where oxidation number of sulphur is 2.5).

We know that the idea of fractional oxidation number is unconvincing to us, because electrons 
are never shared/transferred in fraction. Actually this fractional oxidation state is the average 
oxidation state of the element under examination and the structural parameters reveal that the 
element for whom fractional oxidation state is realised is present in different oxidation states.

The element marked with asterisk in each species is exhibiting the different oxidation 
state (oxidation number) from rest of the atoms  of the same element in each of the species. 
This reveals that in C3O2, two carbon atoms are present in +2 oxidation state each, whereas 
the third one is present in zero oxidation state and the average is 4/3. However, the realistic 
picture is +2 for two terminal carbons and zero for the middle carbon. Likewise in Br3O8, each 
of the two terminal bromine atoms are present in +6 oxidation state and the middle bromine 
is present in +4 oxidation state. Once again the average, that is different from reality, is  
16/3. In the same fashion, in the species S 2

state of +5 and the two middle sulphurs as zero. The average of four  oxidation numbers of sulphurs 
of the S4O

6 is 2.5, whereas the reality being + 5,0,0 and +5 oxidation number respectively for 

each sulphur.
We may thus, in general, conclude that the idea of fractional oxidation state should be taken 

with care and the reality is revealed by the structures only. Further, whenever we come across 
with fractional oxidation state of any particular element in any species, we must understand that 
this is the average oxidation number only. In reality (revealed by structures only), the element in 
that particular species is present in more than one whole number oxidation states. Fe3O4, Mn3O4, 
Pb3O4 are some of the other examples of the compounds, which are mixed oxides, where we come 
across with fractional oxidation states of the metal atom. However, the oxidation states may be in 
fraction as in O+

2 and O –
2 where it is +½ and –½ respectively.

SUMMARY 

Redox reactions form an important class of reactions in which oxidation and reduction 
occur simultaneously. Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation 
number, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail. Oxidation, 
reduction, oxidising agent (oxidant) and reducing agent (reductant) have been viewed 
according to each conceptualisation. Oxidation numbers are assigned in accordance with a 
consistent set of rules. Oxidation number and ion-electron method both are useful means in 
writing equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories: 
combination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions. The concept of 
redox couple and electrode processes is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide 
applications in the study of electrode processes and cells.

Molecular Models
Molecular models are physical devices 
that are used for a better visualisation and 
perception of three-dimensional shapes 
of organic molecules. These are made of 
wood, plastic or metal and are commercially 
available. Commonly three types of molecular 
models are used: (1) Framework model, (2) 
Ball-and-stick model, and (3) Space filling 
model. In the framework model only the 
bonds connecting the atoms of a molecule 
and not the atoms themselves are shown. 
This model emphasizes the pattern of 
bonds of a molecule while ignoring the size 
of atoms. In the ball-and-stick model, both 
the atoms and the bonds are shown. Balls 
represent atoms and the stick denotes a 
bond. Compounds containing C=C (e.g.,

8.4	 Classification of Organic (homocyclic).
Compounds

The existing large number of organic 
compounds and their ever -increasing 
numbers has made it necessary to classify 
them on the basis of their structures. Organic Cyclopropane Cyclohexane Cyclohexene
compounds are broadly classified as follows:

Sometimes atoms other than carbon are 
also present in the ring (heterocylic). 
Tetrahydrofuran given below is an example 
of this type of compound:

These exhibit some of the properties similar 
to those of aliphatic compounds.

(b) Aromatic compounds
Aromatic compounds are special types of 
compounds. You will learn about these 
compounds in detail in Unit 9. These include 
benzene and other related ring compounds 
(benzenoid). Like alicyclic compounds, 
aromatic comounds may also have hetero

8.4.2 Homologous Series
A group or a series of organic compounds each 
containing a characteristic functional group 
forms a homologous series and the members of 
the series are called homologues. The members 
of a homologous series can be represented by 
general molecular formula and the successive 
members differ from each other in molecular 
formula by a –Ch2 unit. There are a number 
of homologous series of organic compounds. 
Some of these are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, 
haloalkanes, alkanols, alkanals, alkanones, 
alkanoic acids, amines etc.
	 It is also possible that a compound contains 
two or more identical or different functional 
groups. This gives rise to polyfunctional 
compounds.

8.8	M ethods of Purification of 
Organic Compounds

Once an organic compound is extracted 
from a natural source or synthesised in the 
laboratory, it is essential to purify it. Various 
methods used for the purification of organic 
compounds are based on the nature of the 
compound and the impurity present in it. 

The common techniques used for 
purification are as follows :
(i)	 Sublimation
(ii)	 Crystallisation
(iii)	 Distillation
(iv)	 Differential extraction and
(v)	 Chromatography	

Finally, the purity of a compound is 
ascertained by determining its melting or 
boiling point. Most of the pure compounds 
have sharp melting points and boiling points. 

The hyperconjugation may also be New methods of checking the purity of an 
regarded as no bond resonance. organic compound are based on different

The purification technique based on the above 
principle is known as sublimation and is used 
to separate sublimable compounds from non-
sublimable impurities.

8.8.2	C rystallisation
This is one of the most commonly used 
techniques for the purification of solid organic 
compounds. It is based on the difference in 
the solubilities of the compound and the 
impurities in a suitable solvent. The impure 
compound is dissolved in a solvent in which it 
is sparingly soluble at room temperature but 
appreciably soluble at higher temperature. 
The solution is concentrated to get a nearly 
saturated solution. On cooling the solution, 
pure compound crystallises out and is 
removed by filtration. The filtrate (mother 
liquor) contains impurities and small quantity 
of the compound. If the compound is highly 
soluble in one solvent and very little  soluble 
in another solvent, crystallisation can be Fig.8.5	 Simple distillation. The vapours of a

unit in the fractionating column is called a 
theoretical plate.  Commercially, columns 
with hundreds of plates are available.

One of the technological applications of 
fractional distillation is to separate different 
fractions of crude oil in petroleum industry.

Distillation under reduced 
pressure: This method is 
used to purify liquids having 
very high boiling points and 
those, which decompose at 
or below their boiling points. 
Such liquids are made to boil 
at a temperature lower than 
their normal boiling points 
by reducing the pressure on 
their surface. A liquid boils 
at a temperature at which its 
vapour pressure is equal to 
the external pressure. The 
pressure is reduced with 
the help of a water pump 
or vacuum pump (Fig.8.8). 
Glycerol can be separated from

time the vapours reach to the top of the 
fractionating column, these are rich in the 
more volatile component. Fractionating 
columns are available in various sizes and 
designs as shown in Fig.8.7. A fractionating 
column provides many surfaces for heat 
exchange between the ascending vapours 
and the descending condensed liquid.  Some 
of the condensing liquid in the fractionating 
column obtains heat from the ascending 
vapours and revaporises.  The vapours thus 
become richer in low boiling component.  The 
vapours of low boiling component ascend 
to the top of the column. On reaching the 
top, the vapours become pure in low boiling 
component and pass through the condenser 
and the pure liquid is collected in a receiver. 
After a series of successive distillations, the 
remaining liquid in the distillation flask gets 
enriched in high boiling component. Each 
successive condensation and vaporisation Fig.8.7	 Different types of fractionating columns.

organic chemistry – some basic principles and techniques 291

Summary

In this unit, we have learnt some basic concepts in structure and reactivity of organic 
compounds, which are formed due to covalent bonding. The nature of the covalent bonding 
in organic compounds can be described in terms of orbitals hybridisation concept, 
according to which carbon can have sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised orbitals. The sp3, sp2 and sp 
hybridised carbons are found in compounds like methane, ethene and ethyne respectively. 
The tetrahedral shape of methane, planar shape of ethene and linear shape of ethyne can 
be understood on the basis of this concept. A sp3 hybrid orbital can overlap with 1s orbital 
of hydrogen to give a carbon - hydrogen (C–H) single bond (sigma, σ bond). Overlap of a sp2 
orbital of one carbon with sp2 orbital of another results in the formation of a carbon–carbon 
σ bond. The unhybridised p orbitals on two adjacent carbons can undergo lateral (side-
by-side) overlap to give a pi (π) bond. Organic compounds can be represented by various 
structural formulas. The three dimensional representation of organic compounds on paper 
can be drawn by wedge and dash formula.

Organic compounds can be classified on the basis of their structure or the functional 
groups they contain. A functional group is an atom or group of atoms bonded together in a 
unique fashion and which determines the physical and  chemical properties of the compounds. 
The naming of the organic compounds is carried out by following a set of rules laid down by 
the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). In IUPAC nomenclature, 
the names are correlated with the structure in such a way that the reader can deduce the 
structure from the name.

Organic reaction mechanism concepts are based on the structure of the substrate 
molecule, fission of a covalent bond, the attacking reagents, the electron displacement effects 
and the conditions of the reaction. These organic reactions involve breaking and making 
of covalent bonds. A covalent bond may be cleaved in heterolytic or homolytic fashion. 
A heterolytic cleavage yields carbocations or carbanions, while a homolytic cleavage gives 
free radicals as reactive intermediate. Reactions proceeding through heterolytic cleavage 
involve the complimentary pairs of reactive species. These are electron pair donor known as 
nucleophile and an electron pair acceptor known as electrophile. The inductive, resonance, 
electromeric and hyperconjugation effects may help in the polarisation of a bond making 
certain carbon atom or other atom positions as places of low or high electron densities.

Organic reactions can be broadly classified into following types; substitution, addition, 
elimination and rearrangement reactions. 

Purification, qualitative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds are carried out 
for determining their structures. The methods of purification namely : sublimation, distillation 
and differential extraction are based on the difference in one or more physical properties. 
Chromatography is a useful technique of separation, identification and purification of 
compounds. It is classified into two categories : adsorption and partition chromatography. 
Adsorption chromatography is based on differential adsorption of various components of a 
mixture on an adsorbent. Partition chromatography involves continuous partitioning of the 
components of a mixture between stationary and mobile phases. After getting the compound 
in a pure form, its qualitative analysis is carried out for detection of elements present in it. 
Nitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus are detected by Lassaigne’s test. Carbon and 
hydrogen are estimated by determining the amounts of carbon dioxide and water produced. 
Nitrogen is estimated by Dumas or Kjeldahl’s method and halogens by Carius method. 
Sulphur and phosphorus are estimated by oxidising them to sulphuric and phosphoric acids 
respectively. The percentage of oxygen is usually determined by difference between the total 
percentage (100) and the sum of percentages of all other elements present.

tetrachloride is discharged when bromine

reaction is used as a test for unsaturation. 
Addition of halogens to alkenes is an 
example of electrophilic addition reaction 
involving cyclic halonium ion formation (9.42)
which you will study in higher classes. Markovnikov, a Russian chemist made a 

generalisation in 1869 after studying such 
reactions in detail. These generalisations 
led Markovnikov to frame a rule called 
Markovnikov rule. The rule states that 
negative part of the addendum (adding 

(9.38) molecule) gets attached to that carbon atom 
which possesses lesser number of hydrogen 
atoms. Thus according to this rule, product 
I i.e., 2-bromopropane is expected. In actual 
practice, this is the principal product of the 

 reaction. This generalisation of Markovnikov 
(9.39) rule can be better understood in terms of 

mechanism of the reaction.

Friedrich August Kekulé,a German chemist was born in 1829 at Darmsdt in 
Germany. He became Professor in 1856 and Fellow of Royal Society in 1875. He 
made major contribution to structural organic chemistry by proposing in 1858 that 
carbon atoms can join to one another to form chains and later in 1865,he found 
an answer to the challenging problem of benzene structure by suggesting that 
these chains can close to form rings. He gave the dynamic structural  formula to 
benzene which forms the basis for its modern electronic structure. He described 
the discovery of benzene structure later as:

background. My mental eye, rendered more acute by repeated visions of this 1896)
kind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold  conformations; long 
rows,sometimes more closely fitted together; all twisting and turning in snake like motion. But look! What 
was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of it’s own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my 
eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I woke;.... I spent the rest of the night working out the consequences of 
the hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth but let us 
beware of making our dreams public before they have been approved by the waking mind.”( 1890).
	 One hundred years later, on the occasion of Kekulé’s centenary celebrations a group of compounds 
having polybenzenoid structures have been named as Kekulenes.	

was further found to produce one and only one 
monosubstituted derivative which indicated 
that all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms 
of benzene are identical. On the basis of this 
observation August Kekulé in 1865 proposed 
the following structure for benzene having 
cyclic arrangement of six carbon atoms with

Resonance and stability of benzene
According to Valence Bond Theory, the 
concept of oscillating double bonds in benzene 
is now explained by resonance. Benzene is a 
hybrid of various resonating structures. The 
two structures, A and B given by Kekulé  are 
the main contributing structures. The hybrid 
structure is represented by inserting a circle 
or a dotted circle in the hexagon as shown 
in (C). The circle represents the six electrons 
which are delocalised between the six carbon Fig. 9.7 (a)
atoms of the benzene ring.

picture about the structure of benzene. All 
the six carbon atoms in benzene are sp2

	 The six π electrons are thus delocalised 
and can move freely about the six carbon 
nuclei, instead of any two as shown in 
Fig. 9.6 (a) or (b). The delocalised π electron cloud 
is attracted more strongly by the nuclei of the

SUMMARY

Hydrocarbons are the compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons are mainly 
obtained from coal and petroleum, which are the major sources of energy. Petrochemicals 
are the prominent starting materials used for the manufacture of a large number of 
commercially important products. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and  CNG (compressed 
natural gas), the main sources of energy for domestic fuels and the automobile industry, are 
obtained from petroleum. Hydrocarbons are classified as open chain saturated (alkanes) 
and unsaturated (alkenes and alkynes), cyclic (alicyclic) and aromatic, according to their 
structure. 

The important reactions of alkanes are free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation 
and aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly 
electrophilic additions. Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo 
mainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under 
special conditions. 

Alkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C–C sigma 
bonds. Out of staggered and the eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation 
is more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical 
(cis-trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon–carbon double bond. 

Benzene and benzenoid compounds show aromatic character. Aromaticity, the 
property of being aromatic is possessed by compounds having specific electronic structure 
characterised by Hückel (4n+2)π electron rule. The nature of groups or substituents attached 
to benzene ring is responsible for activation or deactivation of the benzene ring towards 
further electrophilic substitution and also for orientation of the incoming group. Some of 
the polynuclear hydrocarbons having fused benzene ring system have carcinogenic property.
