PATTERNS IN
MATHEMATICS
1.1 What is Mathematics?
Mathematics is, in large part, the search for patterns, and for
the explanations as to why those patterns exist.
Such patterns indeed exist all around us — in nature, in
our homes and schools, and in the motion of the sun, moon,
and stars. They occur in everything that we do and see, from
shopping and cooking, to throwing a ball and playing games, to
understanding weather patterns and using technology.
The search for patterns and their explanations can be a fun
and creative endeavour. It is for this reason that mathematicians
think of mathematics both as an art and as a science. This year, we
hope that you will get a chance to see the creativity and artistry
involved in discovering and understanding mathematical
patterns.
It is important to keep in mind that mathematics
aims to not just find out what patterns exist, but also the
explanations for why they exist. Such explanations can
often then be used in applications well beyond the context in
which they were discovered, which can then help to propel
humanity forward.

For example, the understanding of patterns in the motion of stars,
planets, and their satellites led humankind to develop the theory of
gravitation, allowing us to launch our own satellites and send rockets
to the Moon and to Mars; similarly, understanding patterns in genomes
has helped in diagnosing and curing diseases — among thousands of
other such examples.

1.2 Patterns in Numbers
Among the most basic patterns that occur in mathematics are
patterns of numbers, particularly patterns of whole numbers:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
The branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in whole
numbers is called number theory.
Number sequences are the most basic and among the most
fascinating types of patterns that mathematicians study.
Table 1 shows some key number sequences that are studied in
Mathematics.

1.3 Visualising Number Sequences
Many number sequences can be visualised using pictures. Visualising
mathematical objects through pictures or diagrams can be a very
fruitful way to understand mathematical patterns and concepts.
Let us represent the first seven sequences in Table 1 using the
following pictures.

1.4 Relations among Number Sequences
 ometimes, number sequences can be related to each other in

surprising ways.
Example: What happens when we start adding up odd numbers?

				1 + 3 = 4
				
1+3+5=9
				
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
				
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25
				
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36
						...
This is a really beautiful pattern!
Why does this happen? Do you think it will happen forever?
The answer is that the pattern does happen forever. But why?
As mentioned earlier, the reason why the pattern happens is just as
important and exciting as the pattern itself.
A picture can explain it
Visualising with a picture can help explain the phenomenon. Recall
that square numbers are made by counting the number of dots in a
square grid.
How can we partition the dots in a square grid into odd
numbers of dots: 1, 3, 5, 7,... ?

Here is how it can be done:

This picture now makes it evident that
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36.
Because such a picture can be made for a square of any size, this
explains why adding up odd numbers gives square numbers.
By drawing a similar picture, can you say what is the sum of the
first 10 odd numbers?
Now by imagining a similar picture, or by drawing it partially, as
needed, can you say what is the sum of the first 100 odd numbers?
Another example of such a relation between sequences:
Adding up and down
Let us look at the following pattern:
			1 = 1
			
1+2+1=4
			
1+2+3+2+1=9
			
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 16
			
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 25
			
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 36
..
.

This seems to be giving yet another way of getting the square numbers—
by adding the counting numbers up and then down!

1.5 Patterns in Shapes
Other important and basic patterns that occur in Mathematics
are patterns of shapes. These shapes may be in one, two, or three
dimensions (1D, 2D, or 3D) — or in even more dimensions. The
branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in shapes is called
geometry.
Shape sequences are one important type of shape pattern that
mathematicians study. Table 3 shows a few key shape sequences
that are studied in Mathematics.

1.6 Relation to Number Sequences
Often, shape sequences are related to number sequences in
surprising ways. Such relationships can be helpful in studying and
understanding both the shape sequence and the related number
sequence.
Example: The number of sides in the shape sequence of Regular
Polygons is given by the counting numbers starting at 3, i.e., 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, .... That is why these shapes are called, respectively, regular
triangle, quadrilateral (i.e., square), pentagon, hexagon, heptagon,
octagon, nonagon, decagon, etc., respectively.
The word ‘regular’ refers to the fact that these shapes have
equal-length sides and also equal ‘angles’ (i.e., the sides look the same
and the corners also look the same). We will discuss angles in more
depth in the next chapter.
The other shape sequences in Table 3 also have beautiful
relationships with number sequences.

To get from one shape to the next shape in the Koch
Snowflake sequence, one replaces each line segment­ ‘—’
by a ‘speed bump’
. As one does this more and more
times, the changes become tinier and tinier with very very
small line segments. How many total line segments are
there in each shape of the Koch Snowflake? What is the
corresponding number sequence? (The answer is 3, 12, 48, ...,
i.e., 3 times Powers of 4; this sequence is not shown in Table 1.)

Mathematics may be viewed as the search for patterns and for the
explanations as to why those patterns exist.
Among the most basic patterns that occur in mathematics are number
sequences.
Some important examples of number sequences include the counting
numbers, odd numbers, even numbers, square numbers, triangular
numbers, cube numbers, Virahānka numbers, and powers of 2.
Sometimes number sequences can be related to each other in beautiful
and remarkable ways. For example, adding up the sequence of odd
numbers starting with 1 gives square numbers.
Visualising number sequences using pictures can help to understand
sequences and the relationships between them.
Shape sequences are another basic type of pattern in mathematics.
Some important examples of shape sequences include regular polygons,
complete graphs, stacked triangles and squares, and Koch snowflake
iterations. Shape sequences also exhibit many interesting relationships
with number sequences.

Lines and Angles

I n this chapter, we will explore some of the most basic ideas of
geometry including points, lines, rays, line segments and angles.
These ideas form the building blocks of ‘plane geometry’, and will
help us in understanding more advanced topics in geometry such as
the construction and analysis of different shapes.

2.1 Point
Mark a dot on the paper with a sharp tip of a pencil. The sharper the
tip, the thinner will be the dot. This tiny dot will give you an idea of
a point. A point determines a precise location, but it has no length,
breadth or height. Some models for a point are given below.

The tip of a
compass

The sharpened
end of a pencil

The pointed
end of a needle

If you mark three points on a piece of paper,
you may be required to distinguish these three
points. For this purpose, each of the three points
may be denoted by a single capital letter such as

Z

P

T

Reprint 2025-26

Chapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd 13

13-08-2024 16:14:25

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Z, P and T. These points are read as ‘Point Z’, ‘Point P’ and ‘Point T’. Of
course, the dots represent precise locations and must be imagined to be
invisibly thin.

2.2 Line Segment
Fold a piece of paper and unfold it. Do you
see a crease? This gives the idea of a line
segment. It has two end points, A and B.
Mark any two points A and B on a sheet of
paper. Try to connect A to B by various
routes (Fig. 2.1).
What is the shortest route from A to B?
This shortest path from point A to Point B
(including A and B) as shown here is called
the line segment from A to B. It is denoted by
either AB or BA. The points A and B are called
the end points of the line segment AB.

2.3 Line

Imagine that the line segment from A to B (i.e.,

beyond B in the other direction without any
end (see Fig. 2.2). This is a model for a line. Do
A
you think you can draw a complete picture of
Fig. 2.2
a line? No. Why?
A line through two points A and B is written as AB . It extends
forever in both directions. Sometimes a line is denoted by a letter like
l or m.
Observe that any two points determine a unique line that passes
through both of them.

2.4 Ray
A ray is a portion of a line that starts at one point (called the starting
point or initial point of the ray) and goes on endlessly in a direction.
The following are some models for a ray:

lighthouse

Ray of light from a torch

Sun rays

An angle is formed by two rays having a
common starting point. Here is an angle
B
formed by rays BD and BE where B is vertex
arm
the common starting point (Fig. 2.8).
The point B is called the vertex of the
E
angle, and the rays BD and BE are called
Fig. 2.8
the arms of the angle. How can we name
this angle? We can simply use the vertex and say that it is the Angle B.
To be clearer, we use a point on each of the arms together with the
vertex to name the angle. In this case, we name the angle as Angle DBE
or Angle EBD. The word angle can be replaced by the symbol ‘∠’, i.e.,
∠DBE or ∠EBD. Note that in specifying the angle, the vertex is always
written as the middle letter.
To indicate an angle, we use a small curve at the vertex (refer
to Fig. 2.9).

Do you see angles being made in each of these cases? Can you mark
their arms and vertex?
Which angle is greater—the angle in Case 1 or the angle in Case 2?
Just as we talk about the size of a line based on its length, we also
talk about the size of an angle based on its amount of rotation.
So, the angle in Case 2 is greater as in this case she needs to rotate
the cover more. Similarly, the angle in Case 3 is even larger than that
of Case 2, because there is even more rotation, and Cases 4, 5, and 6
are successively larger angles with more and more rotation.
The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn that is needed
about the vertex to move the first ray to the second ray.

an angle. The vertex is the point where the two
arms are joined. Identify the arms and vertex of
the angle.

• A pair of scissors has two blades. When we open

them (or ‘turn them’) to cut something, the blades
form an angle. Identify the arms and the vertex of
the angle.

Comparing angles by superimposition
Any two angles can be compared by placing them one over the other,
i.e., by superimposition. While superimposing, the vertices of the
angles must overlap.

and which is larger.

The corners of both of these angles match and the arms overlap with
each other, i.e., OA ↔ OX and OB ↔ OY. So, the angles are equal in size.
The reason these angles are considered to be equal in size is
because when we visualise each of these angles as being formed out
of rotation, we can see that there is an equal amount of rotation
needed to move OB to OA and OY to OX .
From the point of view of superimposition, when two angles
are superimposed, and the common vertex and the two rays of
both angles lie on top of each other, then the sizes of the angles
are equal.

A teacher needs to check the understanding of the students around
the notion of an angle. Sometimes students might think that
increasing the length of the arms of the angle increases the angle.
For this, various situations should be posed to the students to check
their understanding on the same.

Take a cardboard and make an angle-shaped slit as shown below
by tracing and cutting out the shape of one of the rotating arms.

Now, shuffle and mix up all the rotating arms. Can you identify
which of the rotating arms will pass through the slit?
The correct one can be found by placing each of the rotating arms
over the slit. Let us do this for some of the rotating arms:

Slit angle is greater than
the arms’ angle. The arms
will not go through the
slit.

Slit angle is less than the
arms’ angle. The arms
will not go through the
slit.

Slit angle is equal to the
arms’ angle. The arms will
go through the slit.

Only the pair of rotating arms where the angle is equal to that of the
slit passes through the slit. Note that the possibility of passing through
the slit depends only on the angle between the rotating arms and not
on their lengths (as long as they are shorter than the length of the slit).

Justify why the two angles are equal. Is there a way to
superimpose and check? Can this superimposition be done by

Each of these equal angles formed are called right angles. So, a
straight angle contains two right angles.

argue with a 90 ̊
angle?

Because they're
always right.

If a straight angle is formed by half of a full turn, how much of a

In the first group, all angles are less than a right angle or in other
words, less than a quarter turn. Such angles are called acute angles.

and less than a half turn. Such angles are called obtuse angles.

2.9 Measuring Angles
We have seen how to compare two angles. But can we actually
quantify how big an angle is using a number without having to
compare it to another angle?
We saw how various angles can be compared using a circle.
Perhaps a circle could be used to assign measures for angles?

Fig. 2.12

To assign precise measures to angles, mathematicians came up
with an idea. They divided the angle in the centre of the circle into

Lines and Angles

360 equal angles or parts. The angle measure of each of these unit
parts is 1 degree, which is written as 1°.
This unit part is used to assign measure to any angle: the measure
of an angle is the number of 1° unit parts it contains inside it.
For example, see this figure:

30 units

It contains 30 units of 1° angle and so we say that its angle measure is 30°.
Measures of different angles: What is the measure of a full turn in
degrees? As we have taken it to contain 360 degrees, its measure is 360°.
What is the measure of a straight angle in degrees? A straight
angle is half of a full turn. As a full-turn is 360°, a half turn is 180°.
What is the measure of a right angle in degrees? Two right angles
together form a straight angle. As a straight angle measures 180°, a
right angle measures 90°.

360 parts goes back to ancient times. The Rigveda, one of the very
oldest texts of humanity going back thousands of years, speaks of
a wheel with 360 spokes (Verse 1.164.48). Many ancient calendars,
also going back over 3000 years—such as calendars of India, Persia,
Babylonia and Egypt—were based on having 360 days in a year. In
addition, Babylonian mathematicians frequently used divisions of 60
and 360 due to their use of sexagesimal numbers and counting by 60s.
Perhaps the most important and practical answer for why
mathematicians over the years have liked and continued to use 360
degrees is that 360 is the smallest number that can be evenly divided
by all numbers up to 10, aside from 7. Thus, one can break up the
circle into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 equal parts, and still have a whole
number of degrees in each part! Note that 360 is also evenly divisible
by 12, the number of months in a year, and by 24, the number of
hours in a day. These facts all make the number 360 very useful.
The circle has been divided into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 10 and 12 parts
below. What are the degree measures of the resulting angles? Write
the degree measures down near the indicated angles.

Degree measures of different angles
How can we measure other angles in degrees? It is for this purpose
that we have a tool called a protractor that is either a circle divided
into 360 equal parts as shown in Fig. 2.12 (on page 32), or a half
circle divided into 180 equal parts.

Angle Bisector
At each step, we folded in halves. This process of getting half of a
given angle is called bisecting the angle. The line that bisects a given
angle is called the angle bisector of the angle.
Identify the angle bisectors in your handmade protractor. Try to make

Let’s Play a Game #1
This is an angle guessing game! Play this game with your classmates
by making two teams, Team 1 and Team 2. Here are the instructions
and rules for the game:

• Team 1 secretly choose an angle measure, for example, 49° and

makes an angle with that measure using a protractor without
Team 2 being able to see it.

• Team 2 now gets to look at the angle. They have to quickly
discuss and guess the number of degrees in the angle (without
using a protractor!).

• Team 1 now demonstrates the true measure of the angle with
a protractor.

• Team 2 scores the number of points that is the absolute

difference in degrees between their guess and the correct
measure. For example, if Team 2 guesses 39°, then they score
10 points (49°–39°).

• Each team gets five turns. The winner is the team with the
lowest score!

• Team 1 announces to all, an angle measure, e.g., 34°.
• A player from Team 2 must draw that angle on the board without

using a protractor. Other members of Team 2 can help the player
by speaking words like ‘Make it bigger!’ or ‘Make it smaller!’.

• A player from Team 1 measures the angle with a protractor
for all to see.

• Team 2 scores the number of points that is the absolute
difference in degrees between Team 2’s angle size and the
intended angle size. For example, if player’s angle from Team 2
is measured to be 25°, then Team 2 scores 9 points (34°–25°).

• Each team gets five turns. The winner is again the team with the
lowest score.

have seen that a straight angle is 180° and a right angle is 90°. How
can other types of angles — acute and obtuse — be described in terms
of their degree measures?

Summary


A point determines a location. It is denoted by a capital letter.



A line segment corresponds to the shortest distance between two
points. The line segment joining points S and T is denoted by ST.



A line is obtained when a line segment like ST is extended on both
sides indefinitely; it is denoted by ST or sometimes by a single small
letter like m.



A ray is a portion of a line starting at a point D and going in one direction
indefinitely. It is denoted by DP where P is another point on the ray.



An angle can be visualised as two rays starting from a common starting
point. Two rays OP and OM form the angle ∠POM (also called ∠MOP);
here, O is called the vertex of the angle, and the rays OP and OM are
called the arms of the angle.



The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn needed about the
vertex to rotate one ray of the angle onto the other ray of the angle.



The sizes of angles can be measured in degrees. One full rotation or
turn is considered as 360 degrees and denoted as 360°.



Degree measures of angles can be measured using a protractor.



Angles can be straight (180°), right (90°), acute (more than 0° and less
than 90°), obtuse (more than 90° and less than 180°), and reflex (more
than 180° and less than 360°).

Is it always easy to compare two angles?

No. it is not always easy to compare two angles. For eg. 89º & 91º angles cannot be
compared without measuring or overlapping. But for the given figures, comparison is easy.

Q.1. Fold a rectangular sheet of paper, then draw a line along the fold created. Name and
compare the angles formed between the fold and the sides of the paper. Make
different angles by folding a rectangular sheet of paper and compare the angles.
Which is the largest and smallest angle you made?

[4]

Ans.

Angles Formed: ∠AEF, ∠BEF, ∠DFE, ∠CFE
Here ∠AEF & ∠CFE are larger than ∠BEF & ∠DFE
Try more cases by folding rectangular sheets in different ways.
Q.2. In each case, determine which angle is greater and why.
a. ∠AOB or ∠XOY
b. ∠AOB or ∠XOB
c. ∠XOB or ∠XOC
Discuss with your friends on how you decided which one is greater.
Ans. (a)- ∠AOB; ∠XOY is an acute angle and ∠AOB = ∠AOX + ∠XOY+∠YOB
(b)- ∠AOB
(c) – None. ∠XOB = ∠XOC

Q.3. Which angle is greater: ∠XOY or ∠AOB? Give reasons.
Ans. By looking at the figure we cannot say. Superimposition or measurement is necessary here.

Section 2.8
Page 28
Q. Is it possible to draw OC such that the two angles are equal to each other in size?
Ans.

Yes, when OA and OB overlap each other on folding the Vidya’s notebook, the crease
OC will divide ∠AOB in two equal sized angles.

Q.2. The angle of a door:
Is it possible to express the amount by which a door is opened using an angle? What
will be the vertex of the angle and what will be the arms of the angle?
Ans. Yes, the vertex of the angle will be the point where door meets the wall. The arms will
be the edges of the door and the wall.

Q.3. Vidya is enjoying her time on the swing. She notices that the greater the angle with
which she starts the swinging, the greater is the speed she achieves on her swing.
But where is the angle? Are you able to see any angle?
Ans. Student may not see the angle, but when the starting arm is fixed as the position where
she starts swinging. The angle can be thought to be between positions where she starts
the swinging (the initial position) and the position where she attains the greatest position
of the swing at any one side.
Q.4. Here is a toy with slanting slabs attached to its sides; the greater the angles or slopes
of the slabs, the faster the balls roll. Can angles be used to describe the slopes of the
slabs? What are the arms of each angle? Which arm is visible and which is not?
Ans. Yes, angles can be used directly to describe slopes of the slab, larger the angle, greater
the slope of the slab. For each angle, one arm is a side and one arm is the slope.
The vertical arm is not visible, whereas the other arm is visible.
Here in this toy, edges of the slabs are the arms of the angles. Top horizontal ray is not
visible, other arms in the form of edges of the slab are visible.

NUMBER PLAY

Numbers are used in different contexts and in many different ways
to organise our lives. We have used numbers to count, and have
applied the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division on them, to solve problems related to our daily lives.
In this chapter, we will continue this journey, by playing with
numbers, seeing numbers around us, noticing patterns, and learning
to use numbers and operations in new ways.
Think about various situations where we use numbers.
Math
List five different situations in which numbers are used. See what Talk
your classmates have listed, share, and discuss.

3.1 Numbers can Tell us Things
What are these numbers telling us?
Some children in a park are standing in a line. Each one says a number.

What do you think these numbers mean?
The children now rearrange themselves, and again each one
says a number based on the arrangement.

Did you figure out what these numbers represent?
Hint:  Could their heights be playing a role?

A child says ‘1’ if there is only one taller child standing next to them.
A child says ‘2’ if both the children standing next to them are taller.
A child says ‘0’, if neither of the children standing next to them are taller.
That is each person says the number of taller neighbours they have.
Try answering the questions below and share your reasoning.
1.  Can the children rearrange themselves so that the children
standing at the ends say ‘2’?
2.  Can we arrange the children in a line so that all would say
only 0s?
3.  Can two children standing next to each other say the same
number?
4.  There are 5 children in a group, all of different heights. Can
they stand such that four of them say ‘1’ and the last one says
‘0’? Why or why not?
5.  For this group of 5 children, is the sequence 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 possible?
6.  Is the sequence 0, 1, 2, 1, 0 possible? Why or why not?
7.  How would you rearrange the five children so that the
maximum number of children say ‘2’?

Numbers in the middle column are added in different ways to get
the numbers on the sides (1500 + 1500 + 400 = 3400). The numbers in
the middle can be used as many times as needed to get the desired
sum. Draw arrows from the middle to the numbers on the sides to
obtain the desired sums.
Two examples are given. It is simpler to do it mentally!

3.10 An Unsolved Mystery — the Collatz Conjecture!
Look at the sequences below—the same rule is applied in all the
sequences:
a. 12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
b. 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
c. 21, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
d. 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
Do you see how these sequences were formed?

68

Chapter 3_Number Play.indd 68

14-08-2024 14:43:46

Number Play

The rule is: one starts with any number; if the number is even,
take half of it; if the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1;
repeat.
Notice that all four sequences above eventually reached the
number 1. In 1937, the German mathematician, Lothar Collatz
conjectured that the sequence will always reach 1, regardless of
the whole number you start with. Even today — despite many
mathematicians working on it — it remains an unsolved problem as
to whether Collatz’s conjecture is true! Collatz’s conjecture is one of
the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.
Make some more Collatz sequences like those above, starting
with your favourite whole numbers. Do you always reach 1?
Do you believe the conjecture of Collatz that all such sequences
will eventually reach 1? Why or why not?

3.11 Simple Estimation
At times, we may not know or need an exact count of things and
an estimate is sufficient for the purpose at hand. For example,
your school headmaster might know the exact number of students
enrolled in your school, but you may only know an estimated
count. How many students are in your school? About 150? 400? A
thousand?
Paromita’s class section has 32 children. The other 2 sections of
her class have 29 and 35 children. So, she estimated the number of
children in her class to be about 100. Along with Class 6, her school
also has Classes 7–10 and each class has 3 sections each. She assumed
a similar number in each class and estimated the number of students
in her school to be around 500.
Figure it Out
	 We shall do some simple estimates. It is a fun exercise, and you may
find it amusing to know the various numbers around us. Remember,

Summary






Numbers can be used for many different purposes including, to convey
information, make and discover patterns, estimate magnitudes, pose
and solve puzzles, and play and win games.
Thinking about and formulating set procedures to use numbers for
these purposes is a useful skill and capacity (called ‘computational
thinking’).
Many problems about numbers can be very easy to pose, but very
difficult to solve. Indeed, numerous such problems are still unsolved
(for example, Collatz’s Conjecture).

Q5 Find out how many supercells are possible for different numbers of cells.
Do you notice any pattern? What is the method to fill a given table to get the
maximum number of supercells? Explore and share your strategy.
Ans.

For even number of cells say,2,4,6,… the number of supercells would be respectively,
2/2 =1,4/2 =2,6/2=3,…
For odd number of cells , say 1,3,5,7,… the number of supercells would be respectively
(1+1)/2= 1, (3+1)/2 = 2, (5+1)/2= 3,(7+1)/2 = 4,…
To get the maximum number ofsupercells, we have to start by filling the first cell as
super cell & then fill alternately.

Q6. Can you fill a supercell table without repeating numbers such that there are no
supercells? Why or why not?
Ans. No; the cell which is filled by the greatest number among the given numbers chosen, will
become super cell irrespective of its position in the table.
Q7. Will the cell having the largest number in a table always be a supercell? Can the cell
having the smallest number in a table be a supercell? Why or why not?
Ans.

Yes, the largest number in a table will always be a supercell.
No, the smallest number in a table can never be a supercell as the number in all the
adjacent cells will be greater than it.

Q.1. Pratibha uses the digits ‘4’, ‘7’, ‘3’ and ‘2’, and makes the smallest and largest 4digit numbers with them: 2347 and 7432. The difference between these two
numbers is 7432 – 2347 = 5085. The sum of these two numbers is 9779. Choose 4–
digits to make:
a. the difference between the largest and smallest numbers greater than 5085.
b. the difference between the largest and smallest numbers less than 5085.
c. the sum of the largest and smallest numbers greater than 9779.
d. the sum of the largest and smallest numbers less than 9779.
Ans. Some of the possibilities are–
a. 7431 – 1347 = 6084
b. 7433 – 3347 = 4086
c. 7433 + 3347 = 10780
d. 7431 + 1347 = 8778
Q.2. What is the sum of the smallest and largest 5-digit palindrome? What is their
difference?
Ans. Smallest 5 digit palindrome = 10001
largest 5 digit palindrome = 99999
Sum = 10001 + 99999 = 110,000
Difference = 99999 – 10001 = 89,998

Q.3. The time now is 10:01. How many minutes until the clock shows the next palindromic
time? What about the one after that?
Ans. Time Now → 10:01
Next palindrome time → 11:11
After 1 hr. 10 min = 70 min the clock will show next palindrome time.
Next palindrome time = 12:21 which will occur after 2 hr. 20 min = 140 min from
10:01.

Q. Can we make 1,000 using the numbers in the middle? Why not? What about 14,000,
15,000 and 16,000? Yes, it is possible. Explore how. What thousands cannot be made?
Ans. No; the only number which is smaller than 1000 is 400 and 1000 is not a multiple of 400.
14000 = 1500 × 8 + 400 × 5
= 12000 + 2000
= 14000
15000 = 13000 + 400 × 5
= 13000 + 2000
= 15000
16000 = 1500 × 8 + 400 × 10
= 12000 + 4000
= 16000
Only one thousand (1000) cannot be made.

Figure it out
Q.1.

Write an example for each of the below scenarios whenever possible.
Could you find examples for all the cases? If not, think and discuss what could be
the reason. Make other such questions and challenge your classmates.

Ans.
•
•
•

5 digit + 5 digit > 90,250
45,000 + 45,400 = 90,400 > 90,250
5 digit + 3 digit = 6 digit sum
99,999 + 999 = 100,998
4 digit + 4 digit = 6 digit sum
Not possible as even the sum of the greatest 4 digit numbers will not give a six
digit sum. (9999 + 9999 = 19,998)
[9]

•

5 digit + 5 digit = 6 digit sum
60,000 + 40,000 = 1,00,000
• 5 digit + 5 digit = 18,500
Not possible as smallest 5-digit number is 10,000.
If both the numbers are 10,000 then the sum is 20,000, which is more than
18,500.
• 5 digit – 5 digit < 56,503
80,000 – 50,000 < 56,503
< 56,503
• 5 digit – 3 digit = 4 digit difference
10,000 – 999 = 9001
• 5 digit – 4 digit = 4 digit difference
12,000 – 2,500 = 9,500
• 5 digit – 5 digit = 3 digit difference
50,999 – 50,000 = 999
• 5 digit – 5 digit = 91,500
Not possible as the difference of the greatest and the smallest 5 digit numbers,
the maximum difference, can be 99,999 – 10,000 = 89,999
Some examples of other such questions are1. 5 digit + 5 digit = 7 digit sum
2. 4 digit + 4 digit = 2900
More such examples can be made.
Q.2.

Always, Sometimes, Never?
Below are some statements. Think, explore and find out if each of the statement is
‘Always true’, ‘Only sometimes true’ or ‘Never true’. Why do you think so? Write
your reasoning; discuss this with the class.
a. 5-digit number + 5-digit number gives a 5-digit number
b. 4-digit number + 2-digit number gives a 4-digit number
c. 4-digit number + 2-digit number gives a 6-digit number
d. 5-digit number – 5-digit number gives a 5-digit number
e. 5-digit number – 2-digit number gives a 3-digit number

Ans. a. Only sometimes true.
20,000 + 80,000 = 1,00,000 not a 5 digit number
b. Only sometimes true
9,999 + 99 = 10,098 not a 4 digit number
c. Never true
9,999 + 99 = 10,098
On adding the greatest 4 digit and the greatest 2 digit numbers, we can reach only 5
digit number 10,098. So there is no possibility of getting a 6 digit number.
d. Only sometimes true
Ex. 12,000 – 10,000 = 2,000
5 digit – 5 digit = 4 digit
e. Never true
Ex. 10,000 – 99 = 9901
[10]

Even if the greatest 2 digit numbers is subtracted from the smallest 5 digit number, 4
digit number will be obtained.

Q. Make some more Collatz sequences like those above, starting with your favourite
whole numbers. Do you always reach 1?
Do you believe the conjecture of Collatz that all such sequences will eventually
reach 1? Why or why not?
Ans. a) 28, 14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
b) 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
Yes we always reach 1.
The even numbers are halved and when we have an odd number we convert it into
an even number by multiplying by 3 and adding 1 so that eventually it can be halved
again. The smallest even number is 2 so we will reach 1 for sure.
Q.3. Name some objects around you that are:
a. a few thousand in number
b. more than ten thousand in number
Ans. A few thousands: car numbers, 4 digit pin
More than ten thousands: Salary, Mobile numbers.
Q.3. Roshan wants to buy milk and 3 types of fruit to make fruit custard for 5 people. He
estimates the cost to be ₹ 100. Do you agree with him? Why or why not?
Ans. Yes, it is possible with less quantity of serving and with purchase of 1-1-1 fruit of each
type.
However, it is not possible with costly fruits and more quantity of serving.
Q.4. Estimate the distance between Gandhinagar (in Gujarat) to Kohima (in Nagaland).
Ans. 2500 kilometer
Q. 5. Sheetal is in Grade 6 and says she has spent around 13,000 hours in school till date.
Do you agree with her? Why or why not?
Ans. No, I do not agree with her.
There are 6 school hours in a day and around 200 working days in a year.
𝟏𝟑,𝟎𝟎𝟎
𝟔×𝟐𝟎𝟎

= 10.8 years

(Nursery, KG, 1,2,3,4,5,6) 8 years
She is in school for 8 years, 13,000 hours is way too high.
Q.7. Make some estimation questions and challenge your classmates!
Ans. Some such are
• How many students are there in your school?
• How many hours does a person sleep in his lifetime on an average?
(More such questions can be made)

Data Handling and
Presentation
If you ask your classmates about their favourite colours, you will
get a list of colours. This list is an example of data. Similarly, if you
measure the weight of each student in your class, you would get a
collection of measures of weight—again data.
Any collection of facts, numbers, measures, observations or other
descriptions of things that convey information about those things is
called data.
We live in an age of information. We constantly see large amounts
of data presented to us in new and interesting ways. In this chapter,
we will explore some of the ways that data is presented, and how we
can use some of those ways to correctly display, interpret and make
inferences from such data!

Navya is showing the list:
Mehnoor – Kabaddi

Pushkal – Satoliya (Pittu)

Anaya – Kabaddi

Jubimon – Hockey

Densy – Badminton

Jivisha – Satoliya (Pittu)

Simran – Kabaddi

Jivika – Satoliya (Pittu)

Teacher’s Note
Provide more opportunities to collect and organise data. Ask students
to guess what is the most popular colour, game, toy, school subject, etc.,
amongst the students in their classroom and then collect the data for it.
It can be a fun activity in which they also learn about their classmates.
Discuss how they can organise the data in different ways, each way
having its own advantages and limitations. For all these tasks and the
tasks under ‘Figure it Out’, discuss the tasks with the children and let
them understand the tasks, and then let them plan and present their
research processes and conclusions in the class.

•• Which mode of travel is used by the most number of students?
•• Which mode of travel is used by the least number of students?

A pictograph represents data through pictures of objects. It helps
answer questions about data with just a quick glance.
In the above pictograph, one unit or symbol ( ) is used to represent
one student. There are also other pictographs where one unit or
symbol stands for many people or objects.
Example: Nand Kishor collected responses from the children of
his middle school in Berasia regarding how often they slept at least
9 hours during the night. He prepared a pictograph from the data:
Response

Number of Children (

= 10 Children)

Always
Sometimes
Never

Answer the following questions using the pictograph:
1.

  hat is the number of children who always slept at least 9
W
hours at night?

2.

 How many children sometimes slept at least 9 hours at night?

3.

How many children always slept less than 9 hours each night?
Explain how you got your answer.

Solutions
1.

for ‘Always’. Each picture
 In the table, there are 5 pictures
represents 10 children. Therefore, 5 pictures indicate
5 × 10 = 50 children.

2.

(2 × 10 = 20) and a half
There are 2 complete pictures
picture (half of 10 = 5). Therefore, the number of children
who sleep at least 9 hours only sometimes is 20 + 5 = 25.

Data Handling and Presentation

What could be the problems faced in preparing such a
pictograph, if the total number of students present in a
class is 33 or 27?

Math
Talk

••  Pictographs are a nice visual and suggestive way to represent
data. They represent data through pictures of objects.

••  Pictographs can help answer questions and make inferences
about data with just a quick glance (in the examples above—
about favourite games, favourite colours, most common modes
of conveyance, number of students absent, etc.).

By reading a pictograph, we can quickly understand the
••  
frequencies of the different categories (for example, cricket,
hockey, etc.) and the comparisons of these frequencies.

••  In a pictograph, the categories can be arranged horizontlly or
vertically. For each category, simple pictures and symbols are
then drawn in the designated columns or rows according to the
frequency of that category.

••  A scale or key (for example,

: 1 student or
: 5 students)
is added to show what each symbol or picture represents. Each
symbol or picture can represent one unit or multiple units.

••  It can be more challenging to prepare a pictograph when the
amount of data is large or when the frequencies are not exact
multiples of the scale or key.

4.3 Bar Graphs

Like pictographs, such
bar graphs can help us to
quickly understand and
interpret
information,
such as the highest value,
the comparison of values
of different categories, etc.

length or height of each bar represents the given number. As we saw in
pictographs, we can use a scale or key when the frequencies are larger.
Let us look at an example of vehicular traffic at a busy road crossing
in Delhi, which was studied by the traffic police on a particular day.
The number of vehicles passing through the crossing each hour from
6 a.m. to 12:00 noon is shown in the bar graph. One unit of length
stands for 100 vehicles.

We can see that the maximum traffic at the crossing is shown
by the longest bar, i.e., for the time interval 7–8 a.m. The bar graph
shows that 1200 vehicles passed through the crossing at that time.
The second longest bar is for 8–9 a.m. During that time, 1000 vehicles
passed through the crossing. Similarly, the minimum traffic is shown
by the smallest bar, i.e., the bar for the time interval 6–7 a.m. During
that time, only about 150 vehicles passed through the crossing. The
second smallest bar is that for the time interval 11 a.m.–12 noon,
when about 600 vehicles passed through the crossing.
The total number of cars passing through the crossing during the
two-hour interval 8.00–10.00 a.m. as shown by the bar graph is about
1000 + 800 = 1800 vehicles.

be difficult! Therefore, we choose the scale so that 1 unit represents
10 crores. The bar graph for this choice is shown in the figure. So a
bar of length 5 units represents 50 crores and of 8 units represents
80 crores.

4.4 Drawing a Bar Graph
In a previous example, Shri Nilesh prepared a frequency table
representing the sweet preferences of the students in his class. Let’s
try to prepare a bar graph to present his data —
1.

  irst, we draw a horizontal

line and a vertical line. On

the horizontal line, we will

write the name of each of
the sweets, equally spaced,
Gujiya

from which the bars will
Barfi

rise in accordance with
Rasgulla
7
their frequencies; and on
the vertical line we will write the frequencies representing the
number of students.

2.

We must choose a scale. That means we must decide how many
students will be represented by a unit length of a bar so that
it fits nicely on our paper. Here, we will take 1 unit length to
represent 1 student.

3.

For jalebi, we therefore need to draw a bar having a height of 6
units (which is the frequency of the sweet jalebi), and similarly
for the other sweets we have to draw bars as high as their
frequencies.

We, therefore, get a bar graph as shown below —

When the frequencies are larger and we cannot use the scale of
1 unit length = 1 number (frequency), we need to choose a different
scale like we did in the case of pictographs.
Example: The number of runs scored by Smriti in each of the
8 matches are given in the table below:
Match

In this example, the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score
is 100. Using a scale of 1 unit length = l run would mean that we
have to go all the way from 0 to 100 runs in steps of l. This would
be unnecessarily tedious. Instead, let us use a scale where 1 unit
length = 10 runs. We mark this scale on the vertical line and draw
the bars according to the scores in each match. We get the following
bar graph representing the above data.

To represent this data in the form of a bar graph, here are the steps —

•• Draw two perpendicular lines, one horizontal and one vertical.
•• Along the horizontal line, mark the ‘items’ with equal spacing

between them and mark the corresponding expenditures along
the vertical line.

••  Take bars of the same width, keeping a uniform gap between them.
••  Choose a suitable scale along the vertical line. Let, 1 unit length =

•	 Like pictographs, bar graphs give a nice visual way to represent
data. They represent data through equally-spaced bars, each of
equal width, where the lengths or heights give frequencies of the
different categories.
•	 Each category is represented by a bar where the length or height
depicts the corresponding frequency (for example, cost) or
quantity (for example, runs).
•	 The bars have uniform spaces between them to indicate that they
are free standing and represent equal categories.
•	 The bars help in interpreting data much faster than a frequency
table. By reading a bar graph, we can compare frequencies of
different categories at a glance.
•	 We must decide the scale (for example, 1 unit length = 1 student
or 1 unit length = ` 200) for a bar graph on the basis of the data
including the minimum and maximum frequencies, so that the
resulting bar graph fits nicely and looks visually appealing on the
paper or poster we are preparing. The markings of the unit lengths
as per the scale must start from zero.

Teacher’s Note

The main focus of this chapter is to learn how to handle data to find
answers to specific questions or inquiries, to test hypotheses or to
take specific decisions. This should be kept in mind when providing
practice opportunities to collect, organise and analyse data.

4.5 Artistic and Aesthetic Considerations
In addition to the steps described in previous sections, there are
also some other more artistic and aesthetic aspects one can consider
when preparing visual presentations of data to make them more
interesting and effective. First, when making a visual presentation
of data such as a pictograph or bar graph, it is important to make
it fit in the intended space; this can be controlled, for example, by
choosing the scale appropriately, as we have seen earlier. It is also
desirable to make the data presentation visually appealing and
easy-to-understand, so that the intended audience appreciates the
information being conveyed.
Let us consider an example. Here is a table naming the tallest
mountain on each continent, along with the height of each mountain
in meters.
South
America

North

Africa

4892m

2228m

Continent

Height

Asia

8848m

6962m

Europe Antarctica Australia

5642m

How much taller is Mount Everest than Mount Koscuiszko? Are
Mount Denali and Mount Kilimanjaro very different in height? This
is not so easy to quickly discern from a large table of numbers.
As we have seen earlier, we can convert the table of numbers
into a bar graph, as shown on the right. Here, each value is drawn
as a horizontal box. These are longer or shorter depending on the

However, since the boxes represent heights, it is better and more
visually appealing to rotate the picture, so that the boxes grow
upward, vertically from the ground like mountains. A bar graph
with vertical bars is also called a column graph. Columns are the
pillars you find in a building that hold up the roof.
Below is a column graph for our table of tallest mountains. From
this column graph, it becomes easier to compare and visualise the
heights of the mountains.

Data Handling and Presentation

In general, it is more intuitive, suggestive and visually appealing
to represent heights, that are measured upwards from the ground,
using bar graphs that have vertical bars or columns. Similarly,
lengths that are parallel to the ground (for example, distances
between location on Earth) are usually best represented using bar
graphs with horizontal arcs.
Figure it Out
1.

If you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the
tallest persons in each class in your school, would you use a graph
with vertical bars or horizontal bars? Why?

2.

 If you were making a table of the longest rivers on each continent
and their lengths, would you prefer to use a bar graph with
vertical bars or with horizontal bars? Why? Try finding out this
information, and then make the corresponding table and bar
graph! Which continents have the longest rivers?

Infographics
When data visualisations such as bar graphs are further beautified
with more extensive artistic and visual imagery, they are called
information graphics or infographics for short. The aim of
infographics is to make use of attention-attracting and engaging
visuals to communicate information even more clearly and quickly,
in a visually pleasing way.
As an example of how infographics can be used to communicate
data even more suggestively, let us go back to the table above listing
the tallest mountain on each continent. We drew a bar graph with
vertical bars (columns) rather than horizontal bars, to be more
indicative of mountains. But instead of rectangles, we could use
triangles, which look a bit more like mountains. And, we can add a
splash of colour as well. Here is the result.

While this infographic might look more appealing and suggestive at
first glance, it does have some issues. The goal of our bar graph earlier
was to represent the heights of various mountains — using bars of the
appropriate heights but the same widths. The purpose of using the
same widths was to make it clear that we are only comparing heights.
However, in this infographic, the taller triangles are also wider! Are
taller mountains always wider? The infographic is implying additional
information that may be misleading and may or may not be correct.
Sometimes going for more appealing pictures can also accidentally
mislead.
Taking this idea further, and to make the picture even more visually
stimulating and suggestive, we can further change the shapes of the
mountains to make them look even more like mountains, and add
other details, while attempting to preserve the heights. For example,
we can create an imaginary mountain range that contains all these
mountains.
Is the infographic below better than the column graph with
rectangular columns of equal width? The mountains look more
realistic, but is the picture accurate?
For example, Everest appears to be twice as tall as Elbrus.

What is 5642 × 2?
While preparing visually-appealing presentations of data, we
also need to be careful that the pictures we draw do not mislead us
about the facts. In general, it is important to be careful when making
or reading infographics, so that we do not mislead our intended
audiences and we, ourselves, are not misled.

Summary






Facts, numbers, measures, observations and other descriptions of
things that convey information about those things is called data.
Data can be organised in a tabular form using tally marks for easy
analysis and interpretation.
Frequencies are the counts of the occurrences of values, measures or
observations.

Pictographs represent data in the form of pictures, or objects or parts
of objects. Each picture represents a frequency which can be 1 or more
than 1 — this is called the scale and it must be specified.
Bar graphs have bars of uniform width; the length or height that
indicates the total frequency of occurrence. The scale that is used to
convert length or height to frequency again, must be specified.
Choosing the appropriate scale for a pictograph or bar graph is
important to accurately and effectively convey the desired information
or data and to also make it visually appealing.
Other aspects of a graph also contribute to its effectiveness and visual
appeal such as how colours are used, what accompanying pictures
are drawn, and whether the bars are horizontal or vertical. These
aspects correspond to the artistic and aesthetic side of data handling
and presentation.
However, making visual representations of data ‘fancy’ can also
sometimes be misleading.
By reading pictographs and bar graphs accurately, we can quickly
understand and make inferences about the data presented.

Q.1. If you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the tallest persons in
each class in your school, would you use a graph with vertical bars or horizontal
bars? Why?
Ans.

To present the data of the heights of the tallest persons in each class in a school, vertical
bar graph is useful as heights of persons can be compared by heights of bars easily.
(Although both bar graphs can be used.) (Think of more reasons!)

Q.2.

If you were making a table of the longest rivers on each continent and their
lengths, would you prefer to use a bar graph with vertical bars or with horizontal
bars? Why? Try finding out this information, and then make the corresponding
table and bar graph! Which continents have the longest rivers?

Ans.

In this case, bar graph with horizontal bars is useful as length of a river is a horizontal
feature, so lengths of rivers can be compared with lengths of horizontal bars easily.
(Although both bar graphs can be used.) (can you think of any other reasons?)

• Jumpy chooses a jump size. If he chooses 4, then he has to
jump only on multiples of 4, starting at 0.
• Jumpy gets the treasure if he lands on the number where
Grumpy placed it.
Which jump sizes will get Jumpy to land on 24?
If he chooses 4: Jumpy lands on 4 → 8 → 12 → 16 → 20 → 24 → 28 → ...
Other successful jump sizes are 2, 3, 6, 8 and 12.

The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 all divide 24 exactly. Recall that
such numbers are called factors or divisors of 24.
Grumpy increases the level of the game. Two treasures are kept
on two different numbers. Jumpy has to choose a jump size and stick
to it. Jumpy gets the treasures only if he lands on both the numbers
with the chosen jump size. As before, Jumpy starts at 0.
Grumpy has kept the treasures on 14 and 36. And, Jumpy chooses
a jump size of 7.
Will Jumpy land on both the treasures? Starting from 0, he jumps
to 7 → 14 → 21 → 28 → 35 → 42 … We see that he landed on 14 but

did not land on 36, so he does not get the treasure. What jump size
should he have chosen?
The factors of 14 are: 1, 2, 7, 14. So, these jump sizes will land on 14.
The factors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 36. These jump sizes
will land on 36.
So, the jump sizes of 1 or 2 will land on both 14 and 36. Notice that
1 and 2 are the common factors of 14 and 36.
The jump sizes using which both the treasures can be reached are
the common factors of the two numbers where the treasures are
placed.

5.2 Prime Numbers
Guna and Anshu want to pack figs (anjeer) that grow in their farm.
Guna wants to put 12 figs in each box and Anshu wants to put 7 figs
in each box.
How many arrangements are possible?
Think and find out the different ways how —
1. Guna can arrange 12 figs in a rectangular manner.
2. Anshu can arrange 7 figs in a rectangular manner.
Guna has listed out these possibilities.
Observe the number of rows and
columns in each of the arrangements.
How are they related to 12?
In the second arrangement, for
example, 12 figs are arranged in two
columns of 6 each or 12 = 2 × 6.
Anshu could make only one
arrangement: 7 × 1 or 1 × 7. There are
no other rectangular arrangements
possible.
In each of Guna’s arrangements,
multiplying the number of rows by
the number of columns gives the
number 12. So, the number of rows
or columns are factors of 12.
We saw that the number 12 can be arranged in a rectangle in
more than one way as 12 has more than two factors. The number 7
can be arranged in only one way, as it has only two factors — 1 and 7.
Numbers that have only two factors are called prime numbers or
primes. Here are the first few primes — 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. Notice
that the factors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself.
What about numbers that have more than two factors? They
are called composite numbers. The first few composite numbers
are — 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20.

What about 1, which has only one factor? The number 1 is neither
a prime nor a composite number.
How many prime numbers are there from 21 to 30? How many
composite numbers are there from 21 to 30?
Can we list all the prime numbers from 1 to 100?
Here is an interesting way to find prime numbers. Just follow the
steps given below and see what happens.
Step 1: Cross out 1 because it is neither prime nor composite.
Step 2: Circle 2, and then cross
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
out all multiples of 2 after that,
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
i.e., 4, 6, 8, and so on.
Step 3: You will find that the 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
next uncrossed number is 3. 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
Circle 3 and then cross out all 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50
the multiples of 3 after that, 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60
i.e., 6, 9, 12, and so on.
61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70
Step 4: The next uncrossed 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80
number is 5. Circle 5 and then
81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90
cross out all the multiples of 5
91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100
after that, i.e., 10, 15, 20, and
so on.
Step 5: Continue this process till all the numbers in the list are either
circled or crossed out.
All the circled numbers are prime
numbers. All the crossed out numbers,
other than 1, are composite numbers. This
method is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
This procedure can be carried on
for numbers greater than 100 also.
Eratosthenes was a Greek mathematician
who lived around 2200 years ago and
developed this method of listing primes.

Which pairs are safe?
Let us go back to the treasure finding game. This time, treasures are
kept on two numbers. Jumpy gets the treasures only if he is able to
reach both the numbers with the same jump size. There is also a
new rule — a jump size of 1 is not allowed.
Where should Grumpy place the treasures so that Jumpy cannot
reach both the treasures?
Will placing the treasure on 12 and 26 work? No! If the jump size
is chosen to be 2, then Jumpy will reach both 12 and 26.
What about 4 and 9? Jumpy cannot reach both using any jump size
other than 1. So, Grumpy knows that the pair 4 and 9 is safe.

factor other than 1. Two numbers are said to be co-prime to each

5.4 Prime Factorisation
Checking if two numbers are co-prime
Teacher:	 Are 56 and 63 co-prime?
Anshu and Guna:  If they have a common factor other than 1, then
they are not co-prime. Let us check.
Anshu:	 I can write 56 = 14 × 4 and 63 = 21 × 3. So, 14 and 4
are factors, of 56. Further, 21 and 3 are factors of
63. So, there are no common factors. The numbers
are co-prime.
Guna:	 Hold on. I can also write 56 = 7 × 8 and 63 = 9 × 7.
We see that 7 is a factor of both numbers, so, they
are not co-prime.
Clearly Guna is right, as 7 is a common factor.
But where did Anshu go wrong?
Writing 56 = 14 × 4 tells us that 14 and 4 are both factors of 56, but it
does not tell all the factors of 56. The same holds for the factors of 63.
Try another example: 80 and 63. There are many ways to factorise
both numbers.
80 = 40 × 2 = 20 × 4 = 10 × 8 = 16 × 5 = ???
63 = 9 × 7 = 3 × 21 = ???
We have written ‘???’ to say that there may be more ways to
factorise these numbers. But if we take any of the given factorisations,
for example, 80 = 16 × 5 and 63 = 9 × 7, then there are no common
factors. Can we conclude that 80 and 63 are co-prime? As Anshu’s
mistake above shows, we cannot conclude that as there may be other
ways to factorise the numbers.
What this means is that we need a more systematic approach to
check if two numbers are co-prime.

Prime factorisation

Take a number such as 56. It is composite, as we saw that it can be
written as 56 = 4 × 14 . So, both 4 and 14 are factors of 56. Now take one
of these, say 14. It is also composite and can be written as 14 = 2 × 7.
Therefore, 56 = 4 × 2 × 7. Now, 4 is composite and can be written as
4 = 2 × 2. Therefore, 56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7. All the factors appearing here, 2
and 7, are prime numbers. So, we cannot divide them further.
In conclusion, we have written 56 as a product of prime numbers.
This is called prime factorisation of 56. The individual factors are
called prime factors. For example, the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7.
Every number greater than 1 has a prime factorisation. The idea
is the same: keep breaking the composite numbers into factors till
only primes are left.
The number 1 does not have any prime factorisation. It is not
divisible by any prime number.
What is the prime factorisation of a prime number like 7? It is just
7 (we cannot break it down any further).
Let us see a few more examples.
By going through different ways of breaking down the number,
we wrote 63 as 3 × 3 × 7 and as 3 × 7 × 3. Are they different? Not
really! The same prime numbers 3 and 7 occur in both cases. Further,
3 appears two times in
36
both and 7 appears once.
Here, you see four

cases, we get two 2s and
2×2×3×3
2×3×2×3

Multiply back to see
that you get 36 in all four cases.
For any number, it is a remarkable fact that there is only one prime
factorisation, except that the prime factors may come in different

orders. As we explain below, the order is not important. However,
as we saw in these examples, there are many ways to arrive at the
prime factorisation!
Does the order matter?

Using this diagram,
can you explain why 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, no matter which way you multiply
2, 3, and 5?
When multiplying numbers, we can do so in any order. The
end result is the same. That is why, when two 2s and two 3s are
multiplied in any order, we get 36. In a later class, we shall study
this under the names of commutativity and associativity of
multiplication.
Thus, the order does not matter. Usually we write the prime
numbers in increasing order. For example, 225 = 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 or 30 =
2 × 3 × 5.

Prime factorisation of a product of two numbers

When we find the prime factorisation of a number, we first write
it as a product of two factors. For example, 72 = 12 × 6. Then, we
find the prime factorisation of each of the factors. In the above example,
12 = 2 × 2 × 3 and 6 = 2 × 3. Now, can you say what the prime factorisation
of 72 is?
The prime factorisation of the original number is obtained by
putting these together.
72 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 3

Prime factorisation is of fundamental importance in the study of
numbers. Let us discuss two ways in which it can be useful.

Using prime factorisation to check if two numbers are co-prime

  et us again take the numbers 56 and 63. How can we check if they
L
are co-prime? We can use the prime factorisation of both numbers —
56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7
Now, we see that 7 is a prime factor of 56 as well as 63. Therefore,
56 and 63 are not co-prime.
What about 80 and 63? Their prime factorisations are as follows:
80 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7
There are no common prime factors. Can we conclude that they
are co-prime? Suppose they have a common factor that is composite.
Would the prime factors of this composite common factor appear in
the prime factorisation of 80 and 63?

Therefore, we can say that if there are no common prime factors,
then the two numbers are co-prime.
Let us see some examples.
Example:  Consider 40 and 231. Their prime factorisations are as
follows:
40 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 231 = 3 × 7 × 11
We see that there are no common primes that divide both 40 and
231. Indeed, the prime factors of 40 are 2 and 5 while, the prime
factors of 231 are 3, 7, and 11. Therefore, 40 and 231 are co-prime!
Example:  Consider 242 and 195. Their prime factorisations are as
follows:
242 = 2 × 11 × 11 and 195 = 3 × 5 × 13
The prime factors of 242 are 2 and 11. The prime factors of 195
are 3, 5, and 13. There are no common prime factors. Therefore, 242
and 195 are co-prime.

Using prime factorisation to check if one number is divisible
by another

We can say that if one number is divisible by another, the prime
factorisation of the second number is included in the prime
factorisation of the first number.
We say that 48 is divisible by 12 because when we divide 48 by 12,
the remainder is zero. How can we check if one number is divisible
by another without carrying out long division?
Example: Is 168 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both:
168 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 = 2 × 2 × 3
Since we can multiply in any order, now it is clear that,
168 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 7 = 12 × 14
Therefore, 168 is divisible by 12.
Example: Is 75 divisible by 21? Find the prime factorisations of both:
75 = 3 × 5 × 5 and 21 = 3 × 7

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

As we saw in the discussion above, if 75 was a multiple of 21, then
all prime factors of 21 would also be prime factors of 75. However, 7
is a prime factor of 21 but not a prime factor of 75. Therefore, 75 is
not divisible by 21.
Example: Is 42 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both:
42 = 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 = 2 × 2 × 3
All prime factors of 12 are also prime factors of 42. But the prime
factorisation of 12 is not included in the prime factorisation of 42.
This is because 2 occurs twice in the prime factorisation of 12 but
only once in the prime factorisation of 42. This means that 42 is not
divisible by 12.
We can say that if one number is divisible by another, then the
prime factorisation of the second number is included in the prime
factorisation of the first number.

Divisibility by 4

Checking if a number is divisible by 4 can also be done easily!
Look at its multiples: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, …
Are you able to observe any patterns that can be used? The
multiples of 10, 5 and 2 have a pattern in their last digits which we
are able to use to check for divisibility. Similarly, can we check if a
number is divisible by 4 by looking at the last digit?
It does not work! Look at 12 and 22. They have the same last digit,
but 12 is a multiple of 4 while 22 is not. Similarly 14 and 24 have the
same last digit, but 14 is not a multiple of 4 while 24 is. Similarly, 16
and 26 or 18 and 28. What this means is that by looking at the last
digit, we cannot tell whether a number is a multiple of 4.
Can we answer the question by looking at more digits? Make a list
of multiples of 4 between 1 and 200 and search for a pattern.
Find numbers between 330 and 340 that are divisible by 4. Also,
find numbers between 1730 and 1740, and 2030 and 2040, that are
divisible by 4. What do you observe?
Is 8536 divisible by 4?
Consider these statements:
1. Only the last two digits matter when deciding if a given
number is divisible by 4.
2. If the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4,
then the original number is divisible by 4.
3. If the original number is divisible by 4, then the number
formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4.

2. If the number formed by the last three digits is divisible

We have seen that long division is not always needed to check if a
number is a factor or not. We have made use of certain observations
to come up with simple methods for 10, 5, 2, 4, 8. Do we have such
simple methods for other numbers as well? We will discuss simple
methods to test divisibility by 3, 6, 7, and 9 in later classes!

If a number is divisible by another, the second number is called a factor
of the first. For example, 4 is a factor of 12 because 12 is divisible by 4
(12 ÷ 4 = 3).
Prime numbers are numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, … that have only two
factors, namely 1 and themselves.
Composite numbers are numbers like 4, 6, 8, 9, … that have more
than 2 factors, i.e., at least one factor other than 1 and themselves. For
example, 8 has the factor 4 and 9 has the factor 3, so 8 and 9 are both
composite.
Every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime
numbers. This is called the number’s prime factorisation. For example,
84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7.
There is only one way to factorise a number into primes, except for
the ordering of the factors.
Two numbers that do not have a common factor other than 1 are said
to be co-prime.
To check if two numbers are co-prime, we can first find their prime
factorisations and check if there is a common prime factor. If there is no
common prime factor, they are co-prime, and otherwise they are not.
A number is a factor of another number if the prime factorisation of
the first number is included in the prime factorisation of the second
number.

PERIMETER AND AREA

6.1 Perimeter
Do you remember what the perimeter of a closed plane figure is?
Let us refresh our understanding!
The perimeter of any closed plane figure is the distance covered
along its boundary when you go around it once. For a polygon, i.e.,
a closed plane figure made up of line segments, the perimeter is
simply the sum of the lengths of its all sides, i.e., the total distance
along its outer boundary.
The perimeter of a polygon = the sum of the lengths of its all sides.
Let us revise the formulas for the perimeter of rectangles, squares,
and triangles.

Perimeter of a rectangle

Consider a rectangle ABCD whose length and breadth are 12 cm and
8 cm, respectively. What is its perimeter?
Perimeter of the rectangle =  Sum of the lengths of its four sides
							

12 cm

= AB + BC + AB + BC

Opposite sides of a

				
= 2 × AB + 2 × BC
rectangle are always
				
= 2 × (AB + BC)
equal. So, AB = CD and
AD = BC
				
= 2 × (12 cm + 8 cm)
				
= 2 × (20 cm)
				
= 40 cm.
From this example, we see that —
Perimeter of a rectangle = length + breadth + length + breadth.
Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth).
 The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and breadth.
1m

Perimeter of a square

Debojeet wants to put coloured tape all around
a square photo frame of side 1m as shown.
What will be the length of the coloured tape
he requires? Since Debojeet wants to put the
coloured tape all around the square photo
frame, he needs to find the perimeter of the
photo frame.
Thus, the length of the tape required =
perimeter of the square
= sum of the lengths of all four sides of the square
= 1 m + 1 m + 1 m + 1 m = 4 m.
Now, we know that all four sides of a square are equal in length.
Therefore, in place of adding the lengths of each side, we can simply
multiply the length of one side by 4.
	  Thus, the length of the tape required = 4 × 1 m = 4 m.
From this example, we see that
Perimeter of a square = 4 × length of a side.
The perimeter of a square is quadruple the length of its side.

Consider a triangle having three given sides of
m
5c
lengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 7 cm. Find its perimeter.
Perimeter of the triangle = 4 cm + 5 cm + 7 cm
7 cm
						
= 16 cm.
Perimeter of a triangle = sum of the lengths of its three sides.
Example: Akshi wants to put lace all around a

rectangular tablecloth that is 3 m long and 2 m
wide. Find the length of the lace required.

Solution
		 Length of the rectangular table cover = 3 m.
		 Breadth of the rectangular table cover = 2 m.
		Akshi wants to put lace all around the
tablecloth.
		 Therefore, the length of the lace required will be the perimeter of the
rectangular tablecloth.
		 Now, the perimeter of the rectangular tablecloth = 2 × (length + breadth)
													

= 2 × (3 m + 2 m)

													= 2 × 5 m = 10 m.
		 Hence, the length of the lace required is 10 m.

Example: Find the distance travelled by Usha if she takes three rounds of
a square park of side 75 m.

Solution
		 Perimeter of the square park = 4 × length
of a side = 4 × 75 m = 300 m.
		 Distance covered by Usha in one
round = 300 m.
		 Therefore, the total distance travelled by
Usha in three rounds = 3 × 300 m = 900 m.

This figure has lines of two different unit lengths. Measure the

red lines — straight lines and the blue lines — diagonal lines. So, the

can write this in a short form as: 6s + 3d units.
Write the perimeters of the figures below in terms of straight and

Perimeter of a regular polygon

Like squares, closed figures that have all sides and all angles equal
are called regular polygons. We studied the sequence of regular
polygons as ‘Shape Sequence’ #1 in Chapter 1. Examples of regular
polygons are the equilateral triangle (where all three sides and all
three angles are equal), regular pentagon (where all five sides and
all five angles are equal), etc.
Perimeter of an equilateral triangle
We know that for any triangle its perimeter
A
is sum of all three sides.
Using this understanding, we can find the

6.2 Area
We have studied the areas of closed figures (regular and irregular)

The amount of region enclosed by a closed figure is called its area.
In previous grades, we arrived at the formula for the area of a
rectangle and a square using square grid paper. Do you remember?
Area of a square = ________

Area of a rectangle = _______

Teacher’s Note
Help students in recalling the method of finding the area of a
rectangle and a square using grid papers. Provide square grid
papers to students and let them come up with the formula.

Let’s see some real-life problems related to these ideas.
Example: A floor is 5 m long and 4 m wide. A square carpet of sides 3 m
is laid on the floor. Find the area of the floor that is not carpeted.

Solution
Length of the floor = 5 m.
Width of the floor = 4 m.
Area of the floor = length × width = 5 m × 4 m = 20 sq m.
Length of the square carpet = 3 m.
Area of the carpet = length × length = 3 m × 3 m = 9 sq m.
Hence, the area of the floor laid with carpet is 9 sq m.
Therefore, the area of the floor that is not carpeted is: area of the floor
minus the area of the floor laid with carpet = 20 sq m – 9 sq m = 11 sq m.

Example: Four square flower beds each of side 4 m are in four corners

on a piece of land 12 m long and 10 m wide. Find the area of the remaining
part of the land.

Solution
Length of the land (l) = 12 m.
Width of land (w) = 10 m.
Area of the whole land = l × w = 12 m × 10 m = 120 sq m.
The sidelength of each of the four square flower beds is (s) = 4 m.
Area of one flower bed = s × s = 4 m × 4 m = 16 sq m.
Hence, the area of the four flower beds = 4 × 16 sq m = 64 sq m.
Therefore, the area of the remaining part of the land is: area of the complete
land minus the area of all four flower beds = 120 sq m – 64 sq m = 56 sq m.

Summary
  The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
  he perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and
		 a. T
width.
  he perimeter of a square is four times the length of any one of its
		 b. T
sides.
  The area of a closed figure is the measure of the region enclosed by
the figure.
  Area is generally measured in square units.
  The area of a rectangle is its length times its width. The area of a square
is the length of any one of its sides multiplied by itself.
  Two closed figures can have the same area with different perimeters,
or the same perimeter with different areas.
  Areas of regions can be estimated (or even determined exactly) by
breaking up such regions into unit squares, or into more generalshaped rectangles and triangles whose areas can be calculated.

Recall that when some whole number of things are shared
equally among some number of people, fractions tell us how
much each share is.
Shabnam:	 Do you remember, if one roti is divided equally
between two children, how much
roti will each child get?
Mukta:

Each child will get half a roti.

Shabnam:	 The fraction ‘one half’ is written as
1 . We also sometimes read this as
2

‘one upon two.’

Mukta:	 If one roti is equally shared among
4 children, how much roti will one child get?
Shabnam: Each child’s share is 14 roti.

Mukta:

And which is more 12 roti or 14 roti?

Shabnam: When 2 children share 1 roti
equally, each child gets 12 roti. When

4 children share 1 roti equally, each
child gets 14 roti. Since, in the second

group more children share the

7.1 Fractional Units and Equal Shares

Which fraction is greater — 15 or 19?

Beni:

No! That is a common mistake. Think of these fractions
as shares.
If one roti is shared among 5 children, each one gets a
share of 15 roti. If one roti is shared among 9 children,
each one gets a share of 19 roti?
Exactly! Now think again - which share is higher?

If I share with more people, I will get less. So, 19 < 15 .

7.5 Mixed Fractions
Fractions greater than one

You marked some fractions on the number line earlier. Did you
notice that the lengths of all the blue lines were less than one and
the lengths of all the black lines were more than 1?
Write down all the fractions you marked on the number line
earlier.
Now, let us classify these in two groups:
Lengths less than 1 unit

Lengths more than 1 unit

Did you notice something common between the fractions that
are greater than 1?
In all the fractions that are less than 1 unit, the numerator is
smaller than the denominator, while in the fractions that are more
than 1 unit, the numerator is larger than the denominator.
We know that 32 , 52 and 72 are all greater than 1 unit. But can we

A mixed number or mixed fraction contains a whole number
(called the whole part) and a fraction that is less than 1 (called the
fractional part).

Can we write a mixed
number (mixed fraction)
as a regular fraction?
Yes! I figured out a way to
write a mixed number as a
regular fraction!

Jaya:  When I have 3 + 34 , this means 1 + 1 + 1 + 34 . I know
1 = 14 + 14 + 14 + 14 .
So I get
.
( 14 + 14 + 14 + 14 ) + ( 14 + 14 + 14 + 14 ) + ( 14 + 14 + 14 + 14 ) + ( 14 + 14 + 14 ) = 15

Therefore, (4 × 14 ) + (4 × 14 ) + (4 × 14 ) + (3 × 14 ) = 15

Expressing a fraction in lowest terms (or in its simplest
form)
In any fraction, if its numerator and denominator have no common
factor except 1, then the fraction is said to be in lowest terms or in
its simplest form. In other words, a fraction is said to be in lowest
terms if its numerator and denominator are as small as possible.
Any fraction can be expressed in lowest terms by finding an
equivalent fraction whose numerator and denominator are as small
as possible.
Let’s see how to express fractions in lowest terms.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

Now, there is no common factor between 4 and 5. Hence, 16
20
expressed in lowest terms is 45 . So, 45 is called the simplest form of 16
,
20
since 4 and 5 have no common factor other than 1.

Any fraction can be converted to
lowest terms by dividing both the
numerator and denominator by the
highest common factor between
them.

This method of addition, which works for adding any number of
fractions, was first explicitly described in general by Brahmagupta
in the year 628 CE! We will describe the history of the development
of fractions in more detail later in the chapter. For now, we simply
summarise the steps in Brahmagupta’s method for addition of
fractions.
Brahmagupta’s method for adding fractions
1. Find equivalent fractions so that the fractional unit is common
for all fractions. This can be done by finding a common multiple
of the denominators (e.g., the product of the denominators, or the
smallest common multiple of the denominators).
2. Add these equivalent fractions with the same fractional units.
This can be done by adding the numerators and keeping the same
denominator.
3. Express the result in lowest terms if needed.
Let us carry out another example of Brahmagupta’s method.
Example: Find the sum of 23 and 15 .
The denominators of the given fractions are 3 and 5. The lowest
common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. Then we see that

Subtraction of fractions with the same fractional unit or
denominator
Brahmagupta’s method also applies when subtracting fractions!
Let us start with the problem of subtracting 47 from 67 , i.e., what is
6 – 4?
7 7

To solve this problem, we can again use the rectangular strips.
In both fractions, the fractional unit is the same, i.e., 17 . Let us first
represent the bigger fraction using a rectangular strip model as
shown:

6
7

Each shaded part represents 17 . Now, we need to subtract 47 . To do
this let us remove 4 of the shaded parts:

Fractional parts to
be removed.

We can do this here directly
because both fractions have
the same fractional units.

So, we are left with 2 shaded parts, i.e., 67 – 47 = 27 .
Try doing this same exercise using the number line.

7.9 A Pinch of History
Do you know what a fraction was called in ancient India? It was
called bhinna in Sanskrit, which means ‘broken’. It was also called
bhaga or ansha meaning ‘part’ or ‘piece’.
The way we write fractions today, globally, originated in India. In
ancient Indian mathematical texts, such as the Bakshali manuscript
(from around the year 300 CE), when they wanted to write 12 , they
wrote it as 12 which is indeed very similar to the way we write it

today! This method of writing and working with fractions continued
to be used in India for the next several centuries, including by
Aryabhata (499 CE), Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya
(c. 750 CE), and Mahaviracharya (c. 850 CE), among others. The line
segment between the numerator and denominator in ‘ 12 ’ and in other

Fractions

fractions was later introduced by the Moroccan mathematician
Al-Hassar (in the 12th century). Over the next few centuries the
notation then spread to Europe and around the world.
Fractions had also been used in other cultures such as the ancient
Egyptian and Babylonian civilisations, but they primarily used only
fractional units, that is, fractions with a 1 in the numerator. More
general fractions were expressed as sums of fractional units, now
called ‘Egyptian fractions’. Writing numbers as the sum of fractional
1
units, e.g., 19
+ 16 + 18 , can be quite an art and leads to beautiful
24 = 2

puzzles. We will consider one such puzzle below.
General fractions (where the numerator is not necessarily 1)
were first introduced in India, along with their rules of arithmetic
operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even
division of fractions. The ancient Indian treatises called the ‘Sulbasutras’ shows that even during Vedic times, Indians had discovered
the rules for operations with fractions. General rules and procedures
for working with and computing with fractions were first codified
formally and in a modern form by Brahmagupta.
Brahmagupta’s methods for working with and computing with
fractions are still what we use today. For example, Brahmagupta
described how to add and subtract fractions as follows:
“By the multiplication of the numerator and the denominator
of each of the fractions by the other denominators, the fractions
are reduced to a common denominator. Then, in case of addition,
the numerators (obtained after the above reduction) are added.
In case of subtraction, their difference is taken.’’ (Brahmagupta,
Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.2, 628 CE)
The Indian concepts and methods involving fractions were
transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few centuries and
they came into general use in Europe in around the 17th century
and then spread worldwide.

Puzzle!

	 It is easy to add up fractional units to obtain the sum 1, if one
uses the same fractional unit, for example,
1
+ 12 = 1, 13 + 13 + 13 = 1, 14 + 14 + 14 + 14 = 1, etc.
2

	 	 However, can you think of a way to add fractional units that
are all different to get 1?
	 	 It is not possible to add two different fractional units to get 1.
The reason is that 12 is the largest fractional unit, and 12 + 12 = 1.
	 	 To get different fractional units, we would have to replace at
least one of the 12 ’s with some smaller fractional unit - but then

the sum would be less than 1! Therefore, it is not possible for
two different fractional units to add up to 1.
	 	 We can try to look instead for a way to write 1 as the sum of
three different fractional units.
1.  Can you find three different fractional units that add
up to 1?

Try
This

	  I  t turns out there is only one solution to this problem
(up to changing the order of the 3 fractions)! Can you
find it? Try to find it before reading further.
Here is a systematic way to find the solution. We know that
1 + 1 + 1 = 1. To get the
3
3
3

fractional units to be different, we will have

to increase at least one of the 13 ’s, and decrease at least one of the
other 13 ’s to compensate for that increase. The only way to increase

1 to another fractional unit is to replace it by 1 . So 1 must be one of
3
2
2

the fractional units.

Now 12 + 14 + 14 = 1. To get the fractional units to be different, we
1

will have to increase one of the 14 ’s and decrease the other 4 to

compensate for that increase. Now the only way to increase 14 to

another fractional unit, that is different from 12 , is to replace it by 13 .

So two of the fractions must be 12 and 13 ! What must be third fraction

then, so that the three fractions add up to 1?

This explains why there is only one solution to the above problem.

2 + 3 + 6 =1

You can try using similar reasoning as in the cases
of two and three fractional units — or find your own

Fraction as equal share: When a whole number of units is divided
into equal parts and shared equally, a fraction results.
Fractional Units: When one whole basic unit is divided into equal
parts, then each part is called a fractional unit.
Reading Fractions: In a fraction such as 5 , 5 is called the numerator
6

and 6 is called the denominator.
Mixed fractions contain a whole number part and a fractional part.
Number line: Fractions can be shown on a number line. Every fraction
has a point associated with it on the number line.
Equivalent Fractions: When two or more fractions represent the
same share or number, they are called equivalent fractions.
Lowest terms: A fraction whose numerator and denominator have
no common factor other than 1 is said to be in lowest terms or in its
simplest form.
Brahmagupta’s method for adding fractions: When adding fractions,
convert them into equivalent fractions with the same fractional unit
(i.e., the same denominator), and then add the number of fractional
units in each fraction to obtain the sum. This is accomplished by
adding the numerators while keeping the same denominator.
Brahmagupta’s method for subtracting fractions: When subtracting

Recall that, in a rectangle:
R1) The opposite sides are equal in length, and
R2) All the angles are 90°.
As in the case of rectangles, the corners and sides are defined for
a square in the same manner.
A square satisfies the following two properties:
S1) All the sides are equal, and
o
S2) All the angles are 90 .
See the rectangle in Fig. 8.4 and the name given to it: ABCD. This
rectangle can also be named in other ways — BCDA, CDAB, DABC,
ADCB, DCBA, CBAD and BADC. So, can a rectangle be named using
any combination of the labels around its corners? No! For example,
it cannot be named ABDC or ACBD. Can you see what names are
allowed and what names are not?

Now, verify your guesses by placing the points X and Y on the
sides and measure how near or far they are.
The distance between X and Y can be obtained by measuring the
length of the line XY.
How does the minimum distance between the points X and Y
compare to the length of AB?
Change the positions of X and Y to check if there are other
positions where they are at their nearest or farthest. You could
construct multiple copies of the rectangle and try out various
positions of X and Y.
How will you keep track of the lengths XY for different positions
of X and Y?
Here is one way of doing it. Suppose here are some of the positions
of X and Y that you have considered:

•

When X is 5 mm away from A and Y is 3 cm away from B,
XY = ___ cm __ mm

•

When X is 1 cm away from A and Y is 1 cm away from B,
XY = ___ cm ___ mm

•

When X is 2 cm away from A and Y is 4 cm away from B,
XY = ___ cm ___ mm and so on.
Is there a shorthand way of writing it down? In all the sentences,
only the position of X, Y and the length XY changes. So we could
write this as:

What can we infer from this figure?
Can you identify the equal sides?
Since, the two squares are identical,
AB = BC and FE = ED
	 Since ABEF and BCDE are squares, all the sides in each of the
squares are equal. This is written as —
AF = AB = BE = FE
BE = BC = CD = ED
So, all the shorter lines are equal!
	 A convention is followed to represent equal sides. It is done by
putting a ‘|’ on the line. Refer to the rough figure.
	 Using this analysis, can you try constructing it? Remember, all
that was asked for is a rectangle that can be divided into two
identical squares and with no measurements imposed.
	 To draw the rectangle ACDF, one could assign any length to AF. For
example, if we assign AF = 4 cm, then what must the length of AC be?
Explore: Can the rectangle now be completed?
	 In fact, one could proceed by drawing AF without even
measuring its length using a ruler. We could then construct a
line perpendicular to AF that is long enough to contain the other
side. As, AB = AF, we need to somehow transfer the length of AF

One of the ways of marking B is by taking a ruler and trying
to move it around to get a point on line l that is 7 cm from point D.
However, this requires trial and error. There is another efficient
method which doesn’t involve trial and error.
		
For this, instead of trying to get that one required point of distance

those structures that appeals to you and
what are the patterns in those structures
that repeat?
Clouds
On the other hand, look at this picture
of clouds. There is no such repetitive pattern.
We can say that the first four figures are symmetrical and the last one is
not symmetrical. A symmetry refers to a part or parts of a figure that

Fold it into half (for the fourth time), but this time along the other
diagonal, as shown in the figure. Open out the fold.
Is there any other way to fold the square so that the two halves
overlap? How many lines of symmetry does the square shape have?
Thus, figures can have multiple lines of symmetry. The figures
below also have multiple lines of symmetry. Can you find them all?

We saw that the diagonal of a square is also a line of symmetry.
Let us take a rectangle that is not a square. Is its diagonal a line of
symmetry?
First, see the rectangle and answer this
question. Then, take a rectangular piece of
paper and check if the two parts overlap by
folding it along its diagonal. What do you
observe?

Reflection
So far we have been saying that when we fold a figure along a line of
symmetry, the two parts overlap completely. We could also say that
the part of the figure on one side of the line of symmetry is reflected
by the line to the other side; similarly, the part of the figure on the
other side of the line of symmetry is reflected to the first side! Let us
understand this by labeling some points on the figure.
The figure shows a square with its corners labeled A, B, C and D.
Let us first consider the vertical line of symmetry. When we reflect

the left side and occupy the positions occupied earlier by A, D. What
happens to the points A, D? A occupies the position occupied by B and
D that of C!

What if we reflect along the diagonal from A to C? Where do
points A, B, C and D go? What if we reflect along the horizontal line of
symmetry?
A figure that has a line or lines of symmetry is thus, also said to have
reflection symmetry.

Generating shapes having lines of symmetry
So far we have seen symmetrical figures and asymmetrical
figures. How does one generate such symmetrical figures? Let us
explore this.

You enjoyed doing this earlier in Class 5. Take a piece of paper. Fold
it in half. Open the paper and spill a few drops of ink (or paint) on
one half.
Now press the halves together and then open the paper again.
• What do you see?
• Is the resulting figure symmetric?
• If yes, where is the line of symmetry?
• Is there any other line along which it can be folded to produce
two identical parts?

symmetrical but there is no line of symmetry!
However, if you fold it, the two halves will not
exactly overlap. On the other hand, if you rotate
it by 90° about the red point at the centre, the
windmill looks exactly the same.
We say that the windmill has rotational
symmetry.
When talking of rotational symmetry, there is always a fixed
point about which the object is rotated. This fixed point is called the
centre of rotation.
Will the windmill above look exactly the same when rotated
through an angle of less than 90°?
No!
An angle through which a figure can be rotated to look exactly the
same is called an angle of rotational symmetry, or just an angle of
symmetry, for short.

Symmetry

For the windmill, the angles of symmetry are 90° (quarter turn),
180° (half turn), 270° (three-quarter turn) and 360° (full turn).
Observe that when any figure is rotated by 360°, it comes back to its
original position, so 360° is always an angle of symmetry.
Thus, we see that the windmill has 4 angles of symmetry.
Do you know of any other shape that has exactly four angles of
symmetry?
How many angles of symmetry does a square have? How much
rotation does it require to get the initial square?
We get back a square overlapping with itself after 90° of rotation.
This takes point A to the position of point B, point B to the position
of point C, point C to the position of point D, and point D back to the
position of point A. Do you know where to mark the centre of rotation?

Example: Find the angles of symmetry of the following strip.

Solution: Let us rotate the strip in a clockwise direction about its centre.

A rotation of 180° results in the figure above. Does this overlap
with the original figure.
No. Why?
Another rotation through 180° from this position gives the original
shape.
This figure comes back to its original shape only after one
complete rotation through 360°. So, we say that this figure does not
have rotational symmetry.
Rotational Symmetry of Figures with
Radial Arms
Consider this figure, a picture with
90O
4 radial arms. How many angles of
symmetry does it have? What are they?
Note that the angle between adjacent
central dotted lines is 90°.
Can you change the angles between
the radial arms so that the figure still has
4 angles of symmetry? Try drawing it.
To check if the figure drawn indeed has 4 angles of symmetry,
you could draw the figure on two different pieces of paper. Cut out
the radial arms from one of the papers. Keep the figure on the paper
fixed and rotate the cutout to check for rotational symmetry.
How will you modify the figure above so that it has only two
angles of symmetry?

Here is one way:

We have seen figures having 4 and 2 angles of symmetry. Can we
get a figure having exactly 3 angles of symmetry? Can you use radial
arms for this?
Let us try with 3 radial arms as in the figure below. How many
angles of symmetry does it have and what are they?
Here is a figure with three radial arms.

Trace and cut out a copy of this figure. By rotating the cutout over
this figure determine its angles of rotation.
We see that only a full turn or a rotation of 360° will bring the figure
back into itself. So this figure does not have rotational symmetry as
360 degrees is its only angle of symmetry.
However, can anything in the figure be changed to make it have
3 angles of symmetry?

Can it be done by changing the angles between the dotted lines?
If a figure with three radial arms should have rotational symmetry,
then a rotated version of it should overlap with the original. Here
are rough diagrams of both of them.
If these two figures must overlap, what can you tell about the
angles?

A

Observe that ∠A must overlap ∠B, ∠B must overlap ∠C and ∠C
must overlap ∠A.
So, ∠A = ∠B = ∠C. What must this angle be?
We know that a full turn has 360 degrees. This is equally distributed
= 120°.
amongst these three angles. So each angle must be 360°

So, the radial arms figure with 3 arms shows rotational symmetry
when the angle between the adjacent dotted lines is 120°. Use paper
cutouts to verify this observation.

3. Give the order of rotational symmetry for each figure:

Let us list down the angles of symmetry for all the cases above.
• Angles of symmetry when there are exactly 2 of them: 180°, 360°.
• Angles of symmetry when there are exactly 3 of them: 120°,
240°, 360°.
• Angles of symmetry when there are exactly 4 of them: 90°,
180°, 270°, 360°.
Do you observe something common about the angles of symmetries
in these cases? The first set of numbers are all multiples of 180. The
second are all multiples of 120. The third are all multiples of 90.
In each case, the angles are the multiples of the smallest angle.
You may wonder and ask if this will always happen. What do you
think?

If the smallest angle of symmetry of a figure is a natural number
in degrees, then it is a factor of 360.

Is there a smallest angle of symmetry for all figures? It turns out
that this is the case for most figures, except for the most symmetric
shapes like the circle, whose symmetries we now discuss.

Symmetries of a circle
The circle is a fascinating figure. What happens when you rotate a
circle clockwise about its centre? It coincides with itself. It does not
matter what angle you rotate it by! So, for a circle, every angle is an
angle of symmetry.

Now take a point on the rim of the circle and join it to the centre.
Extend the segment to a diameter of the circle. Is that diameter
a line of reflection symmetry? It is. Every diameter is a line of
symmetry!
Like wheels, we can find other objects around us having rotational
symmetry. Find them. Some of them are shown below:

Summary










When a figure is made up of parts that repeat in a definite pattern,
we say that the figure has symmetry. We say that such a figure is
symmetrical.
A line that cuts a plane figure into two parts that exactly overlap
when folded along that line is called a line of symmetry or axis of
symmetry of the figure.
A figure may have multiple lines of symmetry.
Sometimes a figure looks exactly the same when it is rotated by an
angle about a fixed point. Such an angle is called an angle of symmetry
of the figure. A figure that has an angle of symmetry strictly between
0 and 360 degrees is said to have rotational symmetry. The point
of the figure about which the rotation occurs is called the centre of
rotation.
A figure may have multiple angles of symmetry.
Some figures may have a line of symmetry but no angle of symmetry,
while others may have angles of symmetry but no lines of symmetry. Some
figures may have both lines of symmetry as well as angles of symmetry.

THE OTHER SIDE OF

Integers

More and more numbers!
Recall that the very first numbers we learned about in the study of
mathematics were the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, …
Then we learned that there are even more numbers! For example,
there is the number 0 (zero), representing nothing, which comes before
1. The number 0 has a very important history in India and now in the
world. For example, around the world we learn to write numbers in
the Indian number system using the digits 0 to 9, allowing us to write
numbers however large or however small using just these 10 digits.
We then learned about more numbers that exist between the
numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, … , such as 1 , 3 , and 13 . These are called
2
2
6
fractions.
But are there still more numbers? Well, 0 is an additional number
that we didn’t know about earlier, and it comes before 1 and is less
than 1. Are there perhaps more numbers that come before 0 and are
less than 0?
Phrased another way, we have seen the number line:
0

However, this is actually only a number ‘ray’, in the language we
learned earlier in geometry; this ray starts at 0 and goes forever to
the right. Do there exist numbers to the left of 0, so that this number
ray can be completed to a true number line?
That is what we will investigate in this chapter!

10.1 Bela’s Building of Fun
Children flock to Bela’s ice cream factory to see
and taste her tasty ice cream. To make it even
more fun for them, Bela purchased a multistoried building and filled it with attractions.
She named it Bela’s Building of Fun.
But this was no ordinary building!
Observe that some of the floors in the
‘Building of Fun’ are below the ground. What are the shops that you
find on these floors? What is there on the ground floor?
A lift is used to go up and down between the floors. It has two
buttons: ‘+’ to go up and ‘–’ to go down. Can you spot the lift?
To go to the Art Centre from the ‘Welcome Hall’, you
must press the ‘+’ button twice.
We say that the button press is + + or + 2.
To go down two floors, you must press the ‘–’
button twice, which we write as – – or – 2.
So if you press + 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘+’
button once), then you will go up one floor and if
you press – 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘–’ button
once), then you will go down 1 floor.
Lift button presses and numbers:
+++ is written as + 3
– – – – is written as – 4

Numbering the floors in the building of fun
Entry to the ‘Building of Fun’ is at the ground floor level and is called
the ‘Welcome Hall’. Starting from the ground floor, you can reach the
Food Court by pressing + 1 and can reach the Art Centre by pressing
+ 2. So, we can say that the Food Court is on Floor + 1 and that the Art
Centre is on Floor + 2.
Starting from the ground floor, you must press – 1 to reach the Toy
Store. So, the Toy Store is on Floor – 1 similarly starting from the ground
floor, you must press – 2 to reach the Video Games shop. So, the Video
Games shop is on Floor – 2.
The ground floor is called Floor 0. Can you see why?
Number all the floors in the Building of Fun.
Did you notice that + 3 is the floor number of the Book
Store, but it is also the number of floors you move
when you press + 3? Similarly, – 3 is the floor number
but it is also the number of floors you go down when
you press – 3, i.e., when you press – – – .
A number with a ‘+’ sign in front is called a positive
number. A number with a ‘–’ sign in front is called a
negative number.
In the ‘Building of Fun’, the floors are numbered
using the ground floor, Floor 0, as a reference or starting
point. The floors above the ground floor are numbered
with positive numbers. To get to them from the ground
floor, one must press the ‘+’ button some number of
times. The floors below the ground are numbered with
negative numbers. To get to them from the ground floor,
one must press the ‘–’ button some number of times.
Zero is neither a positive nor a negative number.
We do not put a ‘+’ or ‘–’ sign in front of it.

Back to zero!
On the ground floor, Basant is in a great hurry and by
mistake he presses +3. What can he do to cancel it and
stay on the ground floor? He can cancel it by pressing
– 3. That is, (+3) + (– 3) = 0.
We call – 3 the inverse of +3. Similarly, the inverse of
– 3 is +3.
If Basant now presses +4 and then presses – 4 in the
lift, where will he reach?
Here is another way to think of the concept of
inverse. If you are at Floor +4 and you press its inverse
– 4, then you are back to zero, the ground floor! If you
are at Floor – 2 and press its inverse +2, then you go to
(– 2) + (+2) = 0, again the ground floor!

Subtraction to find which button to press

In earlier classes, we understood the meaning of subtraction as ‘take
away’. For example, there are 10 books on the shelf. I take away 4
books. How many are left on the shelf?
We can express the answer using subtraction: 10 – 4 = 6 or ‘Ten
take away four is six.’

You may also be familiar with another meaning of subtraction which
is related to comparison or making quantities equal. For example,
consider this situation: I have `10 with me and my sister has `6.
Now, I can ask the question: ʻHow much more money should my
sister get in order to have the same amount as me?ʼ
We can write this in two ways: 6 + ? = 10 Or 10 – 6 = ?
Here, we see the connection between ‘finding the missing number
to be added’ and subtraction.
For subtraction of positive and negative numbers, we will use
this meaning of subtraction as ‘making equal’ or ‘finding the missing
number to be added’.
  Evaluate 15 – 5, 100 – 10 and 74 – 34 from this perspective.
Teacher’s Note
In general, when there are two unequal quantities, subtraction can
indicate the change needed to make the quantities equal. Subtraction
shows how much the starting quantity should change in order to
become the target quantity. In the context of different floor levels,
what is the change required to reach the Target Floor from the Starting
Floor? Notice that the change needed may be positive (for an increase)
or negative (for a decrease).

Your starting floor is the Art Centre and your target floor is the
Sports Centre. What should be your button press?
You need to go three floors up, so you should press + 3. We can
write this as an expression using subtraction:
Target Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed.
In the above example, the starting floor is + 2 (Art Centre) and
the target floor is + 5. The button press to get to + 5 from + 2 is + 3.
Therefore,
(+ 5) – (+ 2) = + 3

Explanation
Recall the connection between addition and subtraction. For 3 + ? = 5,
we can find the missing number using subtraction: 5 – 3 = 2. That is,
subtraction is the same as finding the missing number to be added.
We know that —
Starting Floor + Movement needed = Target Floor
If the movement needed is to be found, then,
Starting Floor + ? = Target Floor
So,
Target Floor – Starting Floor = ? = Movement needed
More examples:
a. If the Target Floor is – 1 and Starting Floor is – 2, what button
should you press?
You need to go one floor up, so, you should press + 1.
Expression: (– 1) – (– 2) = (+1)
b. If the Target Floor is – 1 and Starting floor is +3, what button
should you press?
You need to go four floors down, so, you should press – 4.
Expression: (– 1) – (+ 3) = (– 4)
c. If the Target Floor is +2 and Starting Floor is – 2, what button
should you press?
You need to go four floors up, so, you should press +4.

Adding and subtracting larger numbers

+

The picture shows a mine, a place where
minerals are extracted by digging into the
rock. The truck is at the ground level, but
the minerals are present both above and
below the ground level. There is a fast
moving lift which moves up and down in
a mineshaft carrying people and ore.
Some of the levels are marked in the
picture. The ground level is marked 0.
Levels above the ground are marked by
positive numbers and levels below the
ground are marked by negative numbers.
The number indicates how many metres
above or below the ground level it is.
In the mine, just like in the Building of Fun:
Starting Level + Movement = Target Level
For example,
(+ 40) + (+ 60) = + 100		

(– 90) + (– 55) = – 145

Target Level – Starting Level = Movement needed
For example,
(+ 40) – (– 50) = + 90 		

(– 90) – (+ 40) = – 130

How many negative numbers are there?
Bela’s Building of Fun had only six floors above and five floors below.
That is numbers – 5 to + 6. In the mine above, we have numbers from
– 200 to + 180. But we can imagine larger buildings or mineshafts.
Just as positive numbers + 1, + 2, + 3, ... keep going up without an end,
similarly, negative numbers – 1, – 2, – 3, ... keep going down. Positive
and negative numbers, with zero, are called integers. They go both
ways from 0: … – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, …

To add and subtract even larger integers, we can imagine even larger

For example, suppose we want to carry out the subtraction + 2000
– (– 200). We can imagine a lift with 2000 levels above the ground
and 200 below the ground. Recall that,
Target Level – Starting Level = Movement needed
To go from the Starting Floor – 200 to the Target Floor + 2000, we
must press + 2200 (+ 200 to get to zero, and then + 2000 more after
that to get to + 2200). Therefore, (+ 2000) – (– 200) = + 2200.
Notice that (+ 2000) + (+ 200) is also + 2200.

In the above example, we saw that + 2000 – (– 200) = + 2000 + (+ 200)
= + 2200. In other words, subtracting a negative number is the same
as adding the corresponding positive number. That is, we can
replace subtraction of a negative number by addition of a positive
number!
In the other exercises that you did above, did you notice
that subtracting a negative number was the same as adding
the corresponding positive number?

Talk

Take a look at the ‘infinite lift’ above. Does it remind you
of a number line? In what ways?

Back to the number line
The ‘infinite lift’ we saw above looked very much like a number line,
didn’t it? In fact, if we rotate it by 90°, it basically becomes a number
line. It also tells us how to complete the number ray to a number line,
answering the question that we had asked at the beginning of the
chapter. To the left of 0 are the negative numbers – 1, – 2, – 3, …
Usually we drop the ‘+’ sign on positive numbers and simply write
them as 1, 2, 3, …
– 10 – 9 – 8 – 7 – 6 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1

Instead of traveling along the number line using a lift, we can
simply imagine walking on it. To the right is the positive (forward)
direction, and to the left is the negative (backward) direction.
Smaller numbers are now to the left of bigger numbers and
bigger numbers are to the right of smaller numbers. So, 2 < 5;
– 3 < 2; and – 5 < – 3.
If, from 5 you wish to go over to 9, how far must you travel along
the number line?

You must travel 4 steps. That is why 5 + 4 = 9.
(Remember: Starting Number + Movement = Target Number)
The corresponding subtraction statement is 9 – 5 = 4.

Using the unmarked number line to add and subtract
Just as you can do additions, subtractions and comparisons with small
numbers using the number line above, you can also do them with
large numbers by imagining an ‘infinite number line’ or drawing an
‘unmarked number line’ as follows:
0

This line shows only the position of zero. Other numbers are not
marked. It can be convenient to use this unmarked number line to
add and subtract integers. You can show, or simply imagine, the scale
of the number line and the positions of numbers on it.
For example, this unmarked number line (UNL) shows the
addition problem: 85 + (– 60) = ?
– 60

0

+25

+85

We then can visualise that 85 + (– 60) = 25
The following UNL shows a subtraction problem which can also be
written as a missing addend problem: (– 100) – (+ 250) = ? or 250 + ? = – 100.
?

– 100

0

+ 250

We can then visualise that ? = –350 in this problem.
In this way, you can carry out addition and subtraction problems,
with positive and negative numbers, on paper or in your head using an
unmarked number line.

Converting subtraction to addition and addition to subtraction
Recall that Target Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed
or
Target Floor = Starting Floor + Movement needed
If we start at 2 and wish to go to – 3, what is the movement needed?
First method: Looking at the number line, we see we need to
move – 5 (i.e., 5 in the backward direction). Therefore, – 3 – 2 = – 5.
The movement needed is –5.
Second method: Break the journey from 2 to –3 into two parts.
a. From 2 to 0, the movement is 0 – 2 = – 2.
b. From 0 to –3, the movement is – 3 – 0 = – 3.
The total movement is the sum of the two movements: – 3 + (– 2) = – 5.
Look at the two coloured expressions. There is no subtraction in
the second one!
In this way, we can always convert subtraction to addition. The
number that is being subtracted can be replaced by its inverse
and then added instead.
Similarly, a number that is being added can be replaced by
its inverse and then subtracted. In this way, we can also always
convert addition to subtraction.
Examples:
a. (+ 7) – (+ 5) = (+ 7) + (– 5)
b. (– 3) – (+ 8) = (– 3) + (– 8)
c. (+ 8) – (– 2) = (+ 8) + (+ 2)
d. (+ 6) – (– 9) = (+ 6) + (+ 9)

10.2 The Token Model
Using tokens for addition
In Bela’s Building of Fun, the lift attendant is bored. To entertain
himself, he keeps a box containing lots of positive (red) and negative
(green) tokens. Each time he presses the ‘+’ button, he takes a
positive token from the box and puts it in his pocket. Similarly,
each time he presses the ‘–’ button, he takes a negative token and
puts it in his pocket.
He starts on the ground floor (Floor 0) with an empty pocket. After
one hour, he checks his pocket and finds 5 positive and 3 negative
tokens. On which floor is he now?
He must have pressed ‘+’ five times and ‘–’ 3 times and (+ 5)+(– 3)= + 2.
So, he is at Floor + 2 now.
Here is another way to do the calculation.

A positive token and a negative token cancel each other, because
the value of this pair of tokens together is zero. These two tokens in
his pocket meant that he pressed ‘+’ once and ‘–’ once, respectively,
and these cancel each other. We say that a positive and a negative
token make a ʻzero pairʼ. When you remove all the zero pairs, you are
left with two positive tokens, so (+5) + (–3) = +2.
We can perform any such addition using tokens!
Example: Add + 5 and – 8.

Using tokens for subtraction
We have seen how to perform addition of integers with positive
tokens and negative tokens. We can also perform subtraction using
tokens!
Example: Let us subtract:
(+5) – (+4).
This is easy to do. From 5 positives
take away 4 positives to see the result.

(+ 5) – (+ 4) = + 1

Example: Let us subtract:
(–7) – (–5).
Is (– 7) – (– 5) the same as (– 7) + (+ 5)?

(–7) – (–5) = –2

Example: Let us subtract: (+ 5) – (+ 6).
Put down 5 positives.
But there are not enough tokens to take out 6 positives!

To get around this issue, we can put out an extra zero pair (a
positive and a negative), knowing that this does not change the value
of the set of tokens.
Now, we can take out 6 positives!
See what is left:
We conclude that (+5) – (+6) = – 1.

get the same result as with other methods you now know:

f. (– 2) – (– 6)
c. (– 7) – (– 9)
f. (+ 3) – (+ 15)

Example: + 4 – (– 6).
Start with 4 positives.
We have to take out 6 negatives from these. But there are not
enough negatives.
This is not a problem. We add some zero pairs as this does not
change the value of the set of tokens.
But how many zero pairs? We have to take away 6 negatives so
we put down 6 zero pairs:

Now we can take away 6 negatives:

Therefore, + 4 – (– 6) = + 10.

Suppose you start with `0 in your bank account, and then you have
debits of `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128, and then a single credit of

be worthwhile to temporarily have a negative balance?

As you can see, positive and negative numbers along with zero are
extremely useful in the world of banking and accounting.

Geographical cross sections
We measure the height of geographical features like mountains,
plateaus, and deserts from ‘sea level’. The height at sea level is 0m.
Heights above sea level are represented using positive numbers and
heights below sea level are represented using negative numbers.

10.5 A Pinch of History
Like general fractions, general integers (including zero and the
negative numbers) were first conceived of and used in Asia, thousands
of years ago, before they eventually spread across the world in more
modern times.
The first known instances of the use of negative numbers
occurred in the context of accounting. In one of China’s most
important mathematical works, The Nine Chapters on Mathematical
Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu)—which was completed by the first or second
century CE—positive and negative numbers were represented using
red and black rods, much like the way we represented them using
green and red tokens!

The Other Side of Zero

There was a strong culture of accountancy also in India in ancient
times. The concept of credit and debit was written about extensively
by Kautilya in his Arthaśhāstra (c. 300 BCE), including the recognition
that an account balance could be negative. The explicit use of negative
numbers in the context of accounting is seen in a number of ancient
Indian works, including in the Bakśhālī manuscript from around the
year 300 CE, where a negative number was written using a special
symbol placed after the number (rather than before the number as
we do today).
The first general treatment of positive numbers, negative numbers,
and zero — all on an equal footing as equally-valid numbers on
which one can perform the basic operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and even division — was given by Brahmagupta in
his Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta in the year 628 CE. Brahmagupta gave
clear and explicit rules for operations on all numbers — positive,
negative, and zero — that essentially formed the modern way of
understanding these numbers that we still use today!
Some of Brahmagupta’s key rules for addition and subtraction of
positive numbers, negative numbers and zero are given below:

18.30, 628 CE)

5.

The sum of two positives is positive (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5).
The sum of two negatives is negative. To add two negatives, add
the numbers (without the signs), and then place a minus sign to
obtain the result (e.g., (– 2) + (– 3) = – 5).
To add a positive number and a negative number, subtract the
smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number
(without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to
obtain the result (e.g., – 5 + 3 = – 2, 2 + (– 3) = – 1 and – 3 + 5 = 2).
The sum of a number and its inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0).
The sum of any number and zero is the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0
= – 2 and 0 + 0 = 0).

If a smaller positive is subtracted from a larger positive, the result
is positive (e.g., 3 – 2 = 1).
If a larger positive is subtracted from a smaller positive, the result
is negative (e.g., 2– 3 = – 1).
Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the
corresponding positive number (e.g., 2 – (– 3) = 2 + 3).
Subtracting a number from itself gives zero (e.g., 2 – 2 = 0 and – 2 –
(– 2) = 0).
Subtracting zero from a number gives the same number (e.g., – 2
– 0 = – 2 and 0 – 0 = 0). Subtracting a number from zero gives the
number’s inverse (e.g., 0 – (– 2) = 2).

Once you understand Brahmagupta’s rules, you can do addition
and subtraction with any numbers whatsoever — positive, negative,
and zero!

Can you explain each of Brahmagupta’s rules in terms of Bela’s

Brahmagupta was the first to describe zero as a number on
an equal footing with positive numbers as well as with negative
numbers, and the first to give explicit rules for performing arithmetic
operations on all such numbers, positive, negative, and zero—forming
what is now called a ring. It would change the way the world does
mathematics.
However, it took many centuries for the rest of the world to
adopt zero and negative numbers as numbers. These numbers
were transmitted to, accepted by, and further studied by the Arab
world by the 9th century, before making their way to Europe by the
13th century.

The Other Side of Zero

Surprisingly, negative numbers were still not accepted by many
European mathematicians even in the 18th century. Lazare Carnot, a
French mathematician in the 18th century, called negative numbers
‘absurd’. But over time, zero as well as negative numbers proved
to be indispensable in global mathematics and science, and are
now considered to be critical numbers on an equal footing with
and as important as positive numbers — just as Brahmagupta had
recommended and explicitly described way back in the year 628 CE!
This abstraction of arithmetic rules on all numbers paved the way
for the modern development of algebra, which we will learn about
in future classes.

Summary
 There are numbers that are less than zero. They are written with a ‘–’
sign in front of them (e.g., – 2), and are called negative numbers. They
lie to the left of zero on the number line.
 The numbers ..., – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called integers. The
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called positive integers and the numbers …,
– 4, – 3, – 2, – 1 are called negative integers. Zero (0) is neither positive
nor negative.
 Every given number has another number associated to it which when
added to the given number gives zero. This is called the additive
inverse of the number. For example, the additive inverse of 7 is – 7 and
the additive inverse of – 543 is 543.
 Addition can be interpreted as Starting Position + Movement = Target
Position.
 Addition can also be interpreted as the combination of movements or
increases/decreases: Movement 1 + Movement 2 = Total Movement.
 Subtraction can be interpreted as Target Position – Starting Position
= Movement.

 In general, we can add two numbers by following Brahmagupta’s Rules
for Addition:
a. If both numbers are positive, add the numbers and the result is a
positive number (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5).
b. If both numbers are negative, add the numbers (without the signs),
and then place a minus sign to obtain the result (– 2 + (– 3) = – 5).
c. If one number is positive and the other is negative, subtract the
smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number
(without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to
obtain the result (e.g., – 5 + 3 = – 2).
d. A number plus its additive inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0).
e. A number plus zero gives back the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 = – 2).
 We can subtract two integers by converting the problem into an addition
problem and then following the rules of addition. Subtraction of an
integer is the same as the addition of its additive inverse.
 Integers can be compared: … – 3 < – 2 < – 1 < 0 < +1 < +2 < +3 < ... Smaller
numbers are to the left of larger numbers on the number line.
 We can give meaning to positive and negative numbers by interpreting
them as credits and debits. We can also interpret positive numbers
as distances above a reference point like the ground level. Similarly,
negative numbers can be interpreted as distances below the ground
level. When measuring temperatures in degrees Celsius, positive
temperatures are those above the freezing point of water, and negative
temperatures are those below the freezing point of water.
