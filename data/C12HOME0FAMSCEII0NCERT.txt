Foreword

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 recommends that children’s 
life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle 
marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to 
shape our system and creates a gap between the school, home and community. 
The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt 
to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning 
and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. 
We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction 
of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on 
Education  (1986).

This initiative can succeed only if all stakeholders—school principals, 
parents and teachers—encourage children to reflect on their own learning 
and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise 
that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge 
by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. We also 
must remember that a prescribed textbook is only one of the learning 
resources for a child, and the teacher another. Her/his home and her/
his environment, her/his life and her/his peers, all these are resources 
and sites of learning. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we 
perceive and treat children as the chief agents of their learning, not as 
receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These beliefs imply a considerable 
change in school routines and mode of functioning. 

The book in your hand at present is an example of how a textbook 
can be. It is based on NCERT’s resolve to reconstruct knowledge in all 
areas from the perspective of the learner and the dynamic socio-economic 
realities of contemporary India. The National Focus Group on Gender Issues 
in Education, appointed under the auspices of NCF-2005, emphasises 
the urgency of incorporating women’s perspective for epistemologically 
redefining conventionally defined subjects like home science. We hope that 
the present textbook will make this subject free of gender bias and capable 
of challenging young minds and teachers for creative study and practical 
work.

NCERT appreciates the hard work done by the Textbook Development 
Committee responsible for this book. We are especially grateful to the 
members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the 
Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human 
Resource Development, for their valuable time and contribution and the 
sub-committee (National Review Committee) for Human Ecology and 
Family Sciences (HEFS) for their contribution in reviewing the textbook.

Rationalisation of Content in the 

Textbooks

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce 

content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also 

emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities 

for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, 

the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks 

across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the 

NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this 

exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the 

following:

•	 Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas 

in the same class

•	 Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same 

subject

•	 Difficulty	level
•	 Content, which is easily accessible to students without much 

interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through 

self-learning or peer-learning

•	 Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

is present edition, is a reformatted version aer carrying out the 
changes given above.

Preface

The textbooks on Human Ecology and Family Sciences (HEFS), hitherto 
known as ‘Home Science’, have been developed based on the vision and 
principles of the National Curriculum Framework – 2005 of the NCERT. 
Globally, the field of Home Science is known by newer nomenclatures 
but encompasses basically five domains, namely, Food and Nutrition, 
Human Development and Family Studies, Fabric and Apparel, Resource 
Management, and Communication and Extension. Each of these domains 
or specialisations (as referred to in various colleges and universities) have 
grown and matured with expanding horizons, keeping in tune with the 
changing needs of individuals, families, industry and society. Consequently 
these domains have developed newer thrusts in view of the evolving job 
market, and in many universities have been renamed to represent their 
current status and scope in a better way.

All these domains have their specific content and focus that contribute 
to the Quality of Life (QOL) of individuals, families and communities in 
the global, socio-cultural and socio-economic contexts. Every person is 
entitled to a good QOL, and this creates a demand for professionals who 
can positively contribute to different areas and needs of personal and 
social life – ranging from basic sanitation, housing, health care for physical 
and mental well-being, safety, environmental promotion and protection, 
clothing, finance and a host of myriad allied aspects of living, from micro 
to macro levels. This obviously creates a challenge for educationists and 
educational institutions to train persons to deliver the multifarious services. 
In this context, HEFS provides numerous avenues with interdisciplinary 
perspectives. These include opportunities to work in industry/corporate 
sector, teaching at various levels, research and development, various 
cadres in public sector, regional, national and international organisations 
that work with and for communities as well as entrepreneurial ventures.

The academic fraternity, professionals working for community 
development and those from industry are constantly interacting and shaping 
the education and training in these fields. Thus  educational programmes 
offered under HEFS (Home Science/ Family and Community Sciences) are 
geared towards development of professionals who not only have knowledge 
and skills, but are also sensitised to the challenges, needs and concerns 
related to quality of life, productivity and sustainable development. 

This textbook takes a holistic approach to address the pertinent 
issues related to work, employment and careers, keeping quality of life 
in perspective, individually and collectively. Hence, the first unit and 
chapter is focussed on life skills for livelihood, attitudes to work, work 
challenges, creativity, performance and productivity,  social responsibility 
and volunteerism. The importance of flexibility, diversity, adaptation, 
balance between work, rest and recreation, enhanced job satisfaction, 
and importance of occupational health and safety are dwelt upon.

Entrepreneurship versus employment is discussed, especially bringing 
to the fore the opportunities that entrepreneurship provides for those 
interested in initiating innovation and change. While change is desirable, 
it is important not to forget our rich traditional heritage of knowledge and 
skills. Many of the traditional occupations, when coupled with innovation, 
modern perspectives and good marketing, have tremendous economic 
potential.  

The other chapters and units describe the five salient domains of HEFS. 
Within each domain, there are several fields that offer ample professional 
opportunities and occupational avenues. The syllabus and textbook 
attempt to bring to focus the scope and significance of each domain in the 
present day scenario, with inputs on knowledge and skills to be acquired 
and honed, including use of ICT for not only gathering information but 
also as part of practicals, activities and projects in order to be a ‘valued’ 
professional. 

The practicals have been designed to enable learners to gain insights 
and also have a bird’s eye view of the tasks and challenges inherent in 
the various professional careers and avenues. Considerable emphasis is 
laid on ‘construction of knowledge’ through field exposure and first-hand 
experiences. The exercises and projects would help to encourage critical 
thinking, develop analytical and writing skills and eventually inculcate 
the ‘passion to learn’. Many insights and ‘seeds’ of information have been 
‘sown’. Students and teachers in partnership can explore, think about, 
discover and discuss a variety of topics and issues. Further learning is 
encouraged through select exercises and review questions at the end of 
each unit. Some of the issues of current concern that have been addressed, 
could not only be thought provoking, but also foster sensitivity and social 
responsibility in the users of this textbook. Exercises in understanding 
region-specific opportunities and available resources have been included 
to encourage students (with guidance from their teachers) to understand, 
appraise and appreciate their own socio-cultural ethos and locales. 

Objectives

The Human Ecology and Family Sciences (HEFS) textbook for Class XII 
has been framed to enable the learners to:
1. understand the scope and significance of each domain within HEFS.
2. appreciate the importance of life skills for work, livelihood and careers.
3. become sensitive to the nuances of work vis-à-vis age and gender.
4. appreciate the potential of entrepreneurship and other varied 

professional opportunities.
5. make informed career choices. 

A feedback questionnaire is given at the end. We will appreciate your 
comments and views about various aspects of this textbook. You may use 
the given questionnaire or write to us on a plain paper/send e-mail. Your 
feedback will help us to imporve further reprint editions.

A Note to the Teacher

Dear Teachers,

You must have noted the radical changes in the organisation of these 
textbooks, compared to the conventional way in which Home Science 
education was earlier designed and delivered. However, the contents and 
the focus of the domains within Home Science (now called HEFS in the 
context of the revised NCERT syllabus), essentially remain undiluted. In 
fact, in the syllabus and textbook organisation, care has been taken to cover 
the basics and go further, to expose students to the newer and emerging 
horizons of the five domains – Food and Nutrition or Human Development 
and Family Studies, Fabric and Apparel or Resource Management and 
Communication and Extension. This deliberate departure from the earlier 
convention is to dispel the misconception about the discipline being 
limited in focus and scope to domestic science, and art and craft. It is also 
to create an interest in the field for its varied, multidisciplinary strengths, 
both in terms of quality education and potential for professional avenues. 

In each chapter from Unit 2 onwards, the textbook has been designed 
to inform the learners about the significance and scope of each domain, 
the multiple thrusts that exist and are emerging. Each unit spells out the 
basic concepts, requisite knowledge and skills in each thrust area and 
delineates the career avenues and the preparation required for them in 
order to make informed career choices. 

Unit 1 is about work, life skills, careers and livelihoods. It starts with 
a description about meaningful work and moves on to point out the need 
to balance work with rest and recreation, to ensure a good standard of 
living and quality of life. Further, the chapter elaborates on success and 
happiness in work life resulting from wholesome attitudes and approaches 
to work.  An attempt has been made therein to introduce and sensitise 
youth to ethics, social responsibility, volunteerism and dignity of labour. 
In this context, it is pertinent to discuss the rich heritage of traditional 
occupations of India, with a view to informing the students that with 
creativity and innovation, there are immense opportunities for a satisfying 
career. The immense potential of entrepreneurship as a challenging career 
avenue is brought to focus to further the interests of the youth, especially 
for those who would like to be their own masters, to create employment 
for others while being gainfully self-employed. The unit also delves into 
the importance of a healthy work environment and the need to sustain 
good occupational health, while being aware of occupational hazards and 
safety measures required. It is felt that youth of today need to understand 
current issues including work in the context of age (child labour and 
engaging senior citizens) and gender (women and work). In this context, it 
is felt that the school(s) could invite  ‘guest faculty or experts’ to interact 
with the students to enable them to obtain first hand realistic information.

Teachers should note that considerable theoretical inputs are required 
for students and learners to gain deeper understanding and appreciation 
of the different areas in each domain. Therefore, some basic theoretical 
information has been included in each unit. This theory-based content 
should provide adequate material for testing students’ achievement 
in acquisition of knowledge. Further, based on student interest and 
capability, and region–specific resources and facilities, teachers may 
motivate and help students to obtain more information in areas and issues 
of their interest. The inclusion of review questions, activities, exercises, 
practicals, field visits and reporting, are envisaged as opportunities for 
students to develop reading and writing skills as well as critical and 
analytical thinking. Gathering and processing information is important 
per se. However, students should be encouraged to think and discuss the 
various issues and topics delineated in this textbook as a means of helping 
youth to think, construct knowledge and articulate. All these experiences 
have been deliberately introduced so that learning may be meaningful and 
enjoyable. 

It may be noted that in the units, the authors have included several 
activities and exercises, which are suitable and would enhance learning 
as well as relieve the tedium of classroom instruction. It is expected that 
teachers and students would decide upon the number of activities and 
exercises they can honestly complete within the academic year. Teachers 
may encourage students to do as many as possible in and outside the 
classroom to ‘fan the flame’ of curiosity and joyful learning. Use of ICT 
has been recommended in these textbooks for seeking information, for 
making power point presentations, designing educational and promotional 
materials. In all units, wherever possible, teachers are advised to ensure 
that the students have exposure and practice with ICT for various purposes. 

In addition, a number of inter-disciplinary projects have been included. 
Every student should have an opportunity to participate in any one project, 
and it is expected that students would have an opportunity to participate 
in the chosen project either in groups or in pairs. Since the learners may 
be relatively unfamiliar with conducting projects, it is essential that the 
project be guided by the teacher throughout, from the planning stage to 
execution and report writing.

The syllabii for all chapters delineated in further detail are given herein. 
In the process of developing the textbook, the teams have expressed the 
need for highlighting and including and deleting some selected issues. 
Thus, some modifications have emerged that are indicated in a tabular 
form.

Unit IV - Fabric And Apparel



Introduction

Textile materials are among the oldest materials known to the human 
world. Fabrics made from fibres like cotton, wool, linen and silk have been 
used from pre-historic times for apparel and household articles, and also 
for fishing and hunting nets, ropes, sails for ships, among others. To these 
lists of natural fibres, the last century saw the addition of manufactured 
and synthetic fibres. Textile materials have also provided a suitable 
medium for human creativity, producing items of arts and artifacts. These 
items are valued for their aesthetic appeal apart from their versatility of 
usage.

From your knowledge of Class XI, the various facets of Fabric and 
Apparel study you can recall:

zz Knowledge of basic textile materials and their properties, which make 
the selection suitable for the specific need and for their appropriate 
care and maintenance

zz Significance of clothing and apparel in terms of:

zz social, psychological and economic aspects

zz geographical, cultural and religious needs

zz age and physical growth of the person

zz purely aesthetic or decorative aspects

zz Appreciation of the rich heritage of Indian textiles and its importance 
to India’s economy.

Let us now see how individuals with appropriate education can make 
careers in these areas. From the vast range of possible options, we will 
discuss some selected areas which are promising avenues for career 
development and/or entrepreneurial ventures, which are therefore gaining 
importance in formal study. Foremost in this section are those related to 
Design. 

Design is a term commonly used to describe the appearance and 
appeal of any article. It may be used for the cut and style of a dress, or 
the colour and print of a fabric. However, it is not mere decoration. It is 
the planning and creation of an article for a specific purpose. You have 
learnt in the Class XI that the process of manufacturing and application of 
special treatments on all fibres have made it possible to have fabrics and 
materials suitable for specific use. This would be a good example of Textile 
Designing.

Clothes are an important part of our life. They become part of our 
memories as we remember some of our special occasions by what we were 
wearing. Over a period of time we develop a special style. Very often we 
look for a designer who can provide us that consistent look and also adapt 
current trends. They are referred to as Fashion Designers. 

The areas that are discussed in this Unit are:

zz Design in Fabric and Apparel—Understanding the Fundamentals of 
Design

zz Fashion Design and Merchandising—The design industry is a 
vibrant, varied and dynamic creative sector that plays a powerful 
and important role in many areas of our lives. Fashion design as a 
subject can introduce and prepare students to know how the fashion 
business operates and what to expect while working in it.

zz Production and Quality Control in the Garment Industry—The 
Garment Industry of India is an important part of Indian economy. 
It provides an increasing avenue of jobs in view of the popularity and 
wider usage of technology in this field. 

zz Conservation of textile products, particularly in Museums which 
are resource centres for revival and preservation of heritage, for 
reproduction and development and for creating awareness. 

zz Care and Maintenance of Fabrics in Institutions—This provides 
opportunities for entrepreneurship and professional enterprises, 
be it services rendered at the domestic/household level through 
commercial laundries to special care of fabrics in institutions included 
in the hospital and hospitality sectors.

The subject of Fabric and Apparel has been part of all erstwhile Home 
Science courses. In different Universities and colleges, it is referred to by 
different nomenclatures like Textiles and Clothing or Clothing and Textiles, 
Textiles and Fashion Study or Fashion and Textile Science, Textile Science 
and Apparel Design. These courses are taught as after-school-courses, as 
degree programmes / diplomas in Home Science Colleges, Polytechnics 
teaching Textile Design and Fashion Design, and Art and Design 
Institutes. There is also in-house training in many institutes catering to 
special vocations and professions at all levels. Each of these institutes may 
focus on a specific aspect. Home Science Colleges which offer P.G. degrees 
attempt to give a more comprehensive knowledge covering all aspects.

Note for the Teachers 

zz The schools should have a fabric library, which has additions regularly. 
The fabrics collected would be the common ones, purchased from the 
local market, so that the students identify with them.

zz Outside sources to be included are brochures, advertisement leaflets, 
pattern books and the latest information from internet.

zz Brain storming with students prior to activities would bring in better 
flow of ideas.

zz In practicals, demonstration by the teacher is very necessary.

zz If possible some field trips should be organised — exhibitions, artisans 
at work, museums, garment production unit (even if it is at small 
level).

zz discuss how a student can prepare for a career in the field.

Introduction

The word ‘design’ is a popular contemporary term which has different 
connotations and meanings assigned to it. Very often it is used for high 
fashion dress and its accessories. In fabrics it is associated with the colour 
scheme, or more specifically, the print on it. However, it does not give the 
complete picture. Design is not mere decoration. The most aesthetically 
pleasing object cannot be considered well designed if it is not functional or 
not appropriate to its usage. Design has several meanings. In the broadest 
sense, it can be described as harmony in form. The most important aspect 
of design, however, lies in the meaning and use of the designers’ creative 
urge and expression and therefore, the greatest harmony is achieved only 
when the aesthetic aspect of good design is truly integrated with the utility 

157
of the object which has been created. Thus, we can say that “Design is the 

Reprint 2025-26



human power to conceive, plan, and realise products that serve human 
beings in the accomplishment of any individual or collective purpose.” 
A good design is more than aesthetically pleasing. It is the right use of 
materials to give what people expect in price, colour and service.

Basic Concepts

Design Analysis: Design is an arrangement according to a plan for creation 
of a desired object. It goes one step further than the functional part of 
planning and produces a result which gives aesthetic satisfaction. It is 
studied in two aspects, viz. Structural and Applied.

Structural design is that which depends on form and not superimposed 
ornamentation. In fabric production, it takes into account the basic 
processing of fibre, types of fibres and yarns, variations of weaving, knitting 
etc. and the stages at which colour is added. In dress, it refers to the basic 
cut or silhouette of the garment. Applied design is the part of the design 
which has been super imposed on the basic structure. On fabric finishes, 
dyeing and printing, embroidery and fancy needle-work can change the 
appearance. On garments, it includes trims and notions (fasteners) which 
add to the value of the final product. Fabric Design and Dress Design are 
as much an Art as Architecture, Painting or Sculpture, thus the same 
Grammar of Art is applicable. 

Design consists of two main factors: Elements and Principles.

Elements of Design are the tools of the Art. These are colour, texture, 
and line, shape or form. The elements of design are manipulated to create 
harmony, balance, rhythm, proportion and emphasis. These are the 
Principles of Design. 

Elements of Design

Colour: Colour is all around us in many forms. It is one of the most important 
aspects of all textile materials — be it for apparel, household, commercial 
or institutional use. The identity of the product is most often attributed to 
colour. Everyone responds to colour and has definite preferences. Colour 
reflects the season, events and the spirit of people. The choice is affected 
by culture, tradition, climate, season, occasion or purely personal reason. 
Colour is an important part of Fashion. Designers carefully choose fabric 
colours to make a definite statement.

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



Colour Theory: Colour can be defined as reflection of light striking the 
surface of an object. It is the visual sensation resulting from reflection of 
visible light rays that strike the retina and stimulate cells in the nerves 
of the eye. The nerves send a message to the brain, which produces a 
sensation of a specific kind, and we see colour. The colour that is observed 
by the brain is dependent on the particular wave length or combination of 
wave lengths of the light source. To see colour on any material, light must 
be reflected from the object to be seen by the eye. When all light rays are 
reflected, the object appears white; when none are reflected it is black.

Understanding Colour

Study of colour is dependent on light. Light is a form of radiant 
energy and forms a part of electro-magnetic radiation spectrum. 
Sunlight is the radiant energy reaching the Earth from Sun by 
light waves. Light falling on raindrops are scattered to produce the 
spectrum of seven colours —VIBGYOR (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, 
Yellow, Orange and Red). Sunlight rays are thus composed of these 
seven visible colours along with ultra-violet and infra-red rays.

Light rays of short wavelengths are grouped as receding or restful 
colours — green, blue green, blue and purple. Longer wave lengths have 
red orange and yellow, which are advancing or stimulating colours. Because 
light is composed of different wavelengths, colour is seen in different values 
and intensities. 

Colour is specified in three aspects: Hue, Value and Intensity or Chroma.

Hue is the common name of the colour. Spectrum specifies the 
seven colours as VIBGYOR. To understand colour from a design point 
of view, reference is made to the Munsell’s Colour Wheel. This divides 
colours as; 

zz Primary colours : These cannot be produced by mixing any other 
colour. These are red, yellow and blue (refer circles in the Fig.11.1).

zz Secondary colours : These are made by mixing two primary colours — 
orange, green and violet (squares in the Fig.11.1).

159

Reprint 2025-26

Unit IV - Fabric And Apparel



zz Tertiary or intermediates: These are made by mixing one primary 
and one secondary colour, lying adjacent to each other on the 
colour wheel. Thus we have red-orange, yellow-orange, yellow-green, 
blue-green, blue-purple and red-purple (the small triangles in the 
Fig. 11.1).

Apart from these there are the groups known as neutral colours such 
as white, black, grey, silver and metallics. These are called achromatics, 
i.e., colours without colour.

The common colour wheel shows colours in their purest form and 
fullest intensity.

Value describes lightness or darkness of a hue, which is referred to as tint 
or shade. White has maximum value, while black has the least. Grey Scale 
and Value Chart are 11 (0 –10) grades scale for judging value. It shows 0 
for black, 10 for white and 5 as the mid value for grey or hue. When the 
hue approaches white, it is a tint; when it approaches black it is a shade. 
Grey Scale also helps us to judge the equivalent value of any hue.

Chroma or intensity is the brightness or purity of colour. Dullness results 
when the colour is blended with other colour, specifically with the colour 
opposite to it on colour wheel.

Recognising colour : Most of us with normal eyesight are able to 
distinguish between values and intensities of different hues and give them 
names (e.g., brick red, blood red, tomato red, ruby red, carrot red, etc.). 
Colour names are derived from natural sources—flowers, trees, woods; 161
food, fruits, vegetables, spices; birds, animals, fur; stones and metals,

minerals earth; pigments and paints; among many others. In each group 
you may be able to see reds and pinks, yellows and orange, purples and 
violet, blues, greens, browns and greys. Names often have regional flavour. 
Thus a name of one area may not mean the same to the people of another 
area. In today’s world, when there is international trade in a large number 
of goods, (especially Textile Products) a system of using numbers along 
with names has been devised. The Pantone Shade Card shows (Fig. 11.4) 
all possible hues, tints and shades in varying intensities. Each has been 
given a code number, which is recognised internationally. This helps in 
Fashion Forecasting and when orders for products are given in foreign 
lands.

Colour in Fabric: Colour can be seen 
in fabrics in various design forms. 
We see fabrics which have uniform 
one solid colour, others where the 
colour seems to follow the yarn 
interlacing and still others may 
have colour in any shape. Stages 
of fabric production when colour is 
added give a vast range of designs. 

zz Dyeing is very rarely done 
at the Fibre stage, because Fig. 11.6: Pantone colours in pens
it proves to be the most 
expensive process. However it is resorted to for some manufactured 
fibres which are not easily dyed or if the design requirement is for a 

162
yarn with multicoloured fibres. 

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



zz Dyeing done at Yarn stage helps to create multifarious designs. 
Woven stripes, checks, plaids, or even simple chambrays are common 
designs produced. Brocade and Jacquard patterning is produced by 
weaving dyed yarns. When yarns are tie-dyed it results in beautiful 
Ikat patterns.

zz Dyeing at Fabric stage is the most common method. It may be done to 
produce simple single coloured fabrics and also as designed materials 
through tie and batik.

zz Colour can also be added at the fabric stage by painting, printing, 
embroidery and patch or appliqué work. Here the colour application 
can be in any shape and form.

Textile designers need to have a sound knowledge of the dyeing properties 
of different fibres and fabrics. Depending upon the requirements of the 
final product, they decide the stage and technique of colour application.

Colour Schemes or Colour Harmonies

Certain basic colour schemes are used as guides for combining colours. A 
colour scheme merely suggests the hues that can be combined; the values 
and intensities of the hue and the quantities of each to be used are the 
decisions taken by the designer or the consumer. Colour schemes are best 
studied with reference to the Colour Wheel.

Colour Schemes can be discussed in two groups: Related and Contrasting

Related schemes have at least one hue in common. These are:

zz Monochromatic harmony which means a harmony based on one hue. 
This single hue may be varied in value and/or intensity.

zz Achromatic harmony uses only neutrals such as a combination of 
black and white.

zz Accented neutral utilises one hue and a neutral or an achromatic 
colour.

zz Analogous harmony refers to a color combination using two or three 
hues that lie side by side on the colour wheel. Use of four or more 
hues may create a jumble unless each one is in very small quantity.

Contrasting schemes can be the following:

zz Complementary harmony refers to a harmony using two hues that lie 
directly opposite to one another on the Colour Wheel. 

zz Double complementary has two pairs of complements, generally 
neighbours on the Colour Wheel. 

163

Reprint 2025-26

Unit IV - Fabric And Apparel



zz Split complementary harmony is a three color combination utilising 
a hue, its complement (directly across on the Colour Wheel) and 
neighbor. It may also use a hue and two neighbors of its complement.

zz Analogous complementary is a combination of analogous and 
complementary schemes, a complement selected for dominance in a 
group of neighbouring colours.

zz Triadic Harmony is a combination of three hues that lie equidistant 
from one another on the Colour Wheel.

Activity 1

Collect samples of fabric, printed paper, illustrations of dresses, 
illustrations of interiors of rooms etc. Analyse the colour harmonies, 
specifying hue, value and intensity.

Texture: Texture is the sensory impression of sight and touch and 
refers to the tactile and visual qualities of the material. Each material 
has a distinctive texture (whether textile or otherwise). Texture can be 
described in terms of —

How it looks — shiny, dull, opaque, dense, transparent, translucent, glossy;

How it behaves — hangs limp, stiff, sticking out, clinging, flowing out; 

How it feels — soft, crisp, harsh, smooth, rough, coarse, grainy, pebbly. 

In the chapter ‘Fabrics Around Us’ of the Class XI book, we learnt that 
it is mainly the textile materials that bring texture in our daily life. You 
may also recall the factors which determine the texture in textile materials. 
These can be summarised as —

zz Fibre content — fibre type (natural or man-made), its length and 
fineness and its surface characteristics;

zz Yarn processing and yarn type — method of processing, twist inserted 
during processing, fineness of the yarn and yarn type (simple, 
complex, novelty or textured);

zz Fabric construction technique — weaving (type of weave and its 
compactness), knitting, felting, braiding, lace-making etc.;

zz Fabric finishes — stiffening (starching, sizing or gumming), ironing, 
calendaring and tentering, napping, fulling;

zz Surface ornamentation — tufting, flock printing, embroidery, and 
stitched effects.

The main purpose of texture in dress design is to create interest and 
to enhance the desirable features of the person. Textures used should 
have a pleasing relationship to each other to achieve harmony. In dress, 
the texture used should be appropriate to figure, personal characteristics, 
silhouette or form of costume, and occasion. 

Activity 2

Collect samples of textile materials showing different textures. Try 
to describe their texture in suitable terms (shiny, stiff, smooth, etc.) 
Analyse the factors due to which the texture has been achieved. 

Note for the Teacher

Supplementary classroom material can include different textile 
products, types of wood, stones, minerals, metals, sand, etc., to be 
used for touch and visual characteristics. 

Line

Line is defined as a mark that connects two points; it has a beginning 
and an end. It can also be formed as the outline of an object, shape or 
form. Line is used to define the shape or different parts of a silhouette of a 
design. As an element of design it indicates the shape of things, provides 
movement and determines direction. Line and shape are two elements, 
which together create the pattern or plan of every design. Every decorative 
detail on all articles we see or use is a combination of lines and shapes. 

Types of Line: There are two basic types of line — the straight line and 
the curved line. 

Straight Lines: The straight line is a rigid unbroken line. Straight lines 
create different effects depending on their direction. They can also express 
mood.

zz Vertical lines stress up and down movement, emphasise height and 
give the effect that is severe, dignified and reserved.

zz Horizontal lines stress side to side movement and create a illusion of 
width. Since they repeat the ground line, they give a stable and placid 
effect.

zz Oblique or diagonal lines increase or decrease width and height 
depending on the degree and direction of angle. They can create an 
active, startling or dramatic effect.

165

Reprint 2025-26

Unit IV - Fabric And Apparel



Curved Lines: The curved line is one with any degree of roundness. The 
curved line can be a simple arc or a complicated free hand curve. The 
degree of roundness determines the curve. A slight degree of roundness 
is called a restrained curve; a great degree of roundness gives a circular 
curve. Certain objects are associated with these curves and named as such, 
for example, parabola, scroll, meander, hairpin, whiplash, or serpentine, 
figure of 8, ogee, etc.

zz Long and flowing curved lines appear most graceful and rhythmic.

zz Large rounded curves lend a dramatic touch and tend to exaggerate 
size.

zz Tiny, puffy curves are youthful and gay. 

Line expresses visual meaning; straight lines indicate force, strength 
and rigidity, whereas, curved lines appear soft and graceful when used in 
design. If straight lines are more dominant, the design effect is masculine. 
Curved lines give the impression of feminity and daintiness.

Shapes or Forms: These are made by connecting lines. Shapes can 
be two dimensional, as a drawing or a print on paper or fabric. They can 
be three dimensional as an object that can be viewed from three or more 
sides, like a human body or the garments on it. Since shapes are formed 
by connecting lines, the characteristics of the lines used will determine 
the characteristics of the shape. If only straight lines are used the shape 
will be different than if only curved lines are used. By using different types 
of lines in different combinations, numerous varieties of shapes can be 
created. There are four basic groups of shapes:

zz Natural shapes are those that copy nature or common shapes of 
man-made objects.

zz Stylised shapes are simplified or modified natural shapes. They may 
have some part distorted or exaggerated.

zz Geometric shapes are those that can be mathematically formed, 
or gives a similar impression. They can be formed by using rulers, 
compasses, or other measuring instruments. 

zz Abstract shapes are free-form. They do not resemble any specific 
object but, may represent different things to different people because 
of personal association. 

Shape and form in fabric refer to the fall or drape of the material; to the 
shape of ornamentation and motifs; and the type of placement or repeat 
i.e. the final pattern formation. In apparel it represents the silhouette, cut, 
and final detailing. 

166

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



Patterns: A pattern is formed when shapes are grouped together. This 
grouping may be all of one shape or a combination of two or more types 
of shapes. The arrangement of these shapes can also be natural, stylised, 
geometric or abstract. 

Principles of Design

The development of a successful design depends on the understanding of 
basic design principles. Principles of design are the rules that govern how 
design elements are mixed in the most appropriate way. These include 
proportion, balance, emphasis, rhythm and harmony. Although each 
principle is a separate entity, combining them successfully produces an 
appealing product. 

Proportion: Proportion concerns the relation of one part of an object to 
another. A good design does not permit easy dissection. The elements are 
so skillfully blended that where one leaves off and the other one begins is 
not really apparent. This relationship may be created in size, color, shape 
and texture. All these need to be pleasingly related to each other and to the 
whole. This is generally based on the proportion of golden mean which is 
represented by ratios like 3:5:8 to 5:8:13 and so on. The smaller part 3 has 
the same relationship to the larger part 5 as the larger part 5 has to the 
whole 8. The garment is horizontally divided into 3:5, 5:8 or 8:13 section. 
These sections appear at the waist line, yoke and hemline. A dress appears 
pleasing if the blouse, skirt and total body represents the ratio of 3:5:8. 

For example, in a skirt and blouse dress, the blouse represents 3, the 
skirt should represent 5, and combined effect represents 8; similarly, in a 
shirt-pant dress, the shirt should represent 5 and pant should represent 
8 and combined effect created is 13.

Proportion of colour: Different colours can be worn as shirt and pant to 
create proportion of colour by using the golden mean.

Proportion of texture: This is achieved when various textures of material 
used for making a dress increase or decrease the size of the person wearing 
the garment e.g., heavy and bulky textures appear overpowering on a thin 
and petite person.

Proportion of shape and form: The size and positioning of motifs or print 
in a dress are in proportion to the size of the wearer. Width of the figure, 
length of waist or torso, length of legs may differ from the classic ideal 
figure. Clothing modifies the figure and creates proportion in awkward 
body proportions in a pleasing way. For example, a high waist bodice 
used in maternity clothes camouflages the fullness of the abdomen.

Equal divisions make a person look shorter and wider, whereas unequal 
horizontal division makes a person look slimmer.

Balance: It is defined as equalling the distribution of weight from 
the central point of the garment. A garment needs to be balanced both 
vertically (from centre line) and horizontally (from top to bottom). It can 
be achieved in three ways — formal, informal and radial. The elements of 
design — line, form, color, texture — all are considered while creating a 
balance in a dress.

Formal Balance: An average human body is symmetrical, which means 
the body appears to be the same on each side of a central vertical line. Two 
arms, two eyes, two legs are seen on either side of the central axis; but 
actually slight differences still occur. If the body differs noticeably on one 
side, carefully designed clothes can minimise the difference. Formal vertical 
balance is the least expensive and most expected type of design, found on 
less expensive garments. Formal balance gives a feeling of stability, dignity 
and formality but tends to get monotonous. Horizontal Balance is basically 
used to correct figure problems by using various elements of design, for 
example, dark hue for big size.

Emphasis: The emphasis or focal point of the garment is the area that 
first attracts the viewer’s eye. It adds interest to the garment and may be 
created by the use of colour, design lines, detailing or accessories. Emphasis 
creates centers of interest by focussing the viewers’ attention on a specific 
area of the garment. Details that focus on the face are particularly effective 
because the face is the focal point of beauty in our culture. A beautiful 
embroidered yoke or a contrasting colour blouse further emphasises the 
face. People with figure problems can emphasise or camouflage their 
figure problems for example, woman with small waist can wear a bright 
and contrasting belt to emphasise the positive part of her figure, whereas 
a woman with large hips, wearing a hip belt or other design details at the 
hip area would highlight it further. Emphasis can be created by using 
contrasting colours, different unusual shapes, lines and textures.

Rhythm: Rhythm is repeating of lines, colours, other elements of 
design or details to create a pattern by which the eye can flow through 
the material or article/garment. Rhythm can be created by use of lines, 
shapes, colours and textures in such a way that it gives visual unity. It 
can be created by:

zz Repetition of embroidery laces, buttons piping, colour, etc. at 
necklines, sleeves and hemlines.

zz Cordation by gradual increase or decrease in size of motifs, lines,

zz Radiation where eyes move in an organised way from a central point 
e.g., gathers in waist, yolk or cuffs, etc.

zz Parallelism where elements lie parallel to each other e.g., tucks in a 
yoke or knife pleats in a skirt. Bands of colour also create a rhythm 
effect in a dress.

Harmony: Harmony or unity is created when all elements of design 
come together to give a pleasing harmonious effect. It is a critical factor in 
producing marketable (publicly acceptable) designs. Harmony by shape is 
created when all areas of a garment reflect the same shape. The collar, cuff 
and hem are curved and it square pockets are given they would interrupt 
the continuity of the design. Harmony by texture can be created by using 
the right kind of texture for a dress when dress is in several pieces as in 
salwar kurta and dupatta. A silk kurta and salwar will show bad harmony 
by use of cotton dupatta.

Composition: A composition 
is defined as an artwork or 
concept developed by the 
arrangement or placement of 
elements of design and applying 
principles of designs in the best 
possible way in a given space. To 
create a composition, the creator 
can select two or three principles 
of designs befitting best to the 
requirement of the final artwork 
and good visual appeal. In other 
words, it’s a play of elements 
of design in a given space 
which can be 2- Dimensional or

Preparing for a career

The field of Design for Fabric and Apparel has expanded and has become 
so vast that it can actually be considered as two specialisations. Fabric 
has found usage in numerous things other than apparel and household; 
and apparel is using material other than just fabric. Each use has 
specific requirements in terms of appearance and durability, and the cost 
allocations. The fabric designer, thus, has to have a thorough knowledge 
of fibre characteristics, its advantages and limitations and its processing,

which can help achieve the desired results. He/she must have a sound 
knowledge of the dyeing properties of different fibres and fabrics. Depending 
upon the requirements of the final product, he/she decides the stage and 
technique of colour application. He/she also understands the principles 
of design.

Various institutes offer both long and short term courses leading to a 
certificate, a diploma, an associate, or a bachelors degree in this field. Your 
choice depends upon a number of factors that take into consideration the 
unique qualities of each degree programme.

Scope

Design industry is a vibrant, varied and dynamic creative sector that plays 
a powerful and important role in several areas of our lives. Working in 
textile or fabric design demands awareness of the changing trends and 
styles and an ability to produce designs that are fresh, current or even 
ahead of the fashion curve. Textile designs for apparel fashion tend to have 
a quicker turnaround than designs for furnishing. Textile designers work 
in industry— researching and producing designs for textiles companies 
or fashion houses, but they might also work for a design agency or as 
freelancers.

PracTical 1

Theme:  Preparation of articles using applied textile design technique 
(Tie and Dye) 

Task:  Learning to draw the different techniques of tie and dye

Theory: The oldest form of designing with colour is resist dyeing. The 
resist material could be thread, pieces of fabric, or substances such as 
clay and wax that offer physical resistance. The most common method of 
resist is tying with thread. Tie and dye is the name of a technique in which 
the areas to be in pattern are resisted by means of tightly wound thread. 
When dipped into dye, the resisted areas retain the original colour of the 
ground. You may recall from Class XI, Bandhani, chunari, laheria are some 
of the names of materials in which the pattern is created by tie-dyeing the 
fabric after it is woven. A typical tie and dye design is bandhej where the 
patterns comprise of innumerable dots; another is the laheria type where 
the pattern is in the form of diagonal stripes. Gujarat and Rajasthan are 
the homes of this type of fabrics.

Purpose

1. To learn the concept of tie and dye

2. To learn the process of tie and dye through various techniques

3. Eye and hand coordination

4. Understand curves and shades on the patterns.

Conducting the Practical

Observe the different shapes of leaves and flowers in nature. Draw 
them with pencil by observing. Shade them with different shadows 
to create depth.

As a modern day craft, numerous 
techniques of tying are employed 
to get variegated effects. Resist 
can be offered by using threads 
of different thicknesses, or by the 
material itself through knotting, 
crumpling or folding and then tying 
over it. Some of the techniques are 
described below:

Knotting: It is one of the easiest 
and quickest ways of producing Fig. 11.8: Knotting 171

Reprint 2025-26

Unit IV - Fabric And Apparel



the design. Knots can be tied in several ways depending on the size, shape 
and grain of the fabric. The best results are achieved on fine fabric. It 
creates shaded circular patterns. 

Marbling: This effect can be achieved in two ways. The material is gathered 
and turned into a ball and tied in all directions until it becomes solid mass. 
The fabric can also be twisted and coiled length wise and tied to create 
marbling effect. This method gives variegated and irregular cloud like 
effects. It is thereafter generally dyed in light colours, and may be repeated 
in two or more colours. It helps to create a multicoloured background, 
which can later be tie-dyed in a more definite pattern.

 

   
 Fig. 11.9: Making a Ball Fig. 11.10: Coiling

Binding: Certain parts of fabric are bound very tightly with thread before 
dyeing. Binding can be done in the form of a dot, a band, line, criss-cross 
or spiral. Designs are like stripes — straight or diagonal (lehria), circles or 
spots (bandhej).

Fig. 11.11: Binding

Tritik or sewing: The fabric is sewn with a needle using simple tacking 
stitches along a definite pattern. A strong thread is used with a large knot 
in the beginning. It is pulled so that cloth is gathered closely; and finished 

172

with a knot again to hold the gathers together. The patterns created are 
pleasing bands of dotted textures of various shapes. 

Folding: The fabric is folded in different forms, like pleats, squares, 
triangles. To hold the folds together binding or clipping is done using thread 
or clips respectively. The pattern created is in the form of symmetrical 
stripes, bands, squares etc. Best effects are achieved on thick materials 
because the fabric itself forms the resist. These patterns can be later used 
as background for block printing and embroidery.

Fig. 11.12: Folding

In the class make the above designs on small samples of white cotton 
cloth.

After tying, dye the cloth by simple dyeing method.

Note

Before tying the cloth, design the fabric by washing in hot soapy 
water so that the dye is absorbed evenly by the fabric.

Theme:   Preparation of articles using applied textile design technique: 
(Batik)

Task:  Learning the technique of Batik

Theory: Batik is a form of resist printing, where the resist is obtained by 
applying wax on the fabric in design. Dyeing is then carried out in cold 
to avoid melting of wax, thus confining the colouration to the unwaxed 
area. Further, selective application of wax and re-dyeing allows variety of 
colourings. The beauty of batik is to get cracks in the wax during dyeing 
and allowing colour to enter through these cracks.

Purpose

1. To learn the concept of batik

2. To learn the process of batik by preparing an article

Conducting the Practical

Make the fabric for batik totally free from dirt and grease. Then stretch it 
on a frame for ease in drawing of design and application of wax. Two main 
types of wax are used i.e. light, easily removed type essentially consisting 
of paraffin wax and a darker more adhesive type consisting essentially of 
bees wax. To get various types of cracks take both paraffin and bees wax 
in varied proportions

Application of wax: The most commonly used tools are brushes of 
various widths and sizes. The brushes should have natural hair bristles 
(not of nylon or thermoplastic substances). Apply wax onto the fabric with 
any of the following techniques/ methods.

zz Painting i.e. painting the design area with wax

zz Outlining i.e. painting the outline of the design/ motif with wax.

zz Dry brushing i.e. application with a flat brush, which is free of excess 
wax and carried along the design lines to give a shaded effect

zz Scratching i.e. covering a part of the fabric with wax and then 
scratching the design line with the back of a pin or brush.

Melt the wax in smell container and apply onto the material with brush 
in a pre-determined pattern using any of the above techniques. The wax 
should reach both sides of the material and may have to be applied both 
on the face and back of the fabric. 

174 Dyeing: After the application of wax, dye the fabric. Dyeing is carried 
out by any of the dyes that are applied at temperatures below 35oC. The 

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



dyes used are commonly known as ice colours or batik colours. Multiple 
colour effects are obtained by subsequent wax application/removal of wax 
and additional wax application and then dyeing in another colour. 

Removal of Wax: Dry the fabric after dyeing. Fold and pack in water 
proof packet and freeze it. Remove and crush the frozen wax to reduce 
it to dust. Remove the remaining wax by hot pressing between layers of 
absorbent paper and finally soaping it at boil.

 

PracTical 3

Theme:  Preparation of articles using applied textile design technique 
(Block Printing)

Task:  Learning the technique of block printing and creating 
patterns using blocks

Theory: One of the oldest methods for application of design onto fabric 
is block printing. In block printing, a separate block is required for each 
different colour in the finished design. The blocks are constructed so that 
the design area is raised, and the background area, which is not to be 
printed, is carved away. The majority of the blocks are made of wood, but 
metal may be used to reinforce parts of the design. The blocks may have 
single motif patterns, border patterns or all-over patterns

Purpose

1. To learn the concept of block printing

2. To learn the process of block printing

Conducting the practical

Colours for fabric printing and wooden block printing are available 
in the market. Begin the process of printing with laying the fabric flat 
on a padded table which is covered with a protective sheet. Care must 
be taken to attach the fabric firmly to the table so that its movement 
during printing is prevented. Apply the dye paste in a uniform layer to the 
raised portion of the block, by lightly pressing the block in the printing 
tray containing the dye paste on a sponge base. Then press the block 
on the fabric surface with sufficient pressure to force the colour into 
the fabric. When using multicoloured blocks, start printing with the 
outline block in the darkest colour and then print with the filling blocks in 
lighter colours.

Leave the fabric to dry. Later hot press it from the wrong side.

Learning Objectives
After completing this section the learner will be able to:

zz explain the significance of fashion design and merchandising in 
garment industry

zz describe the fundamentals of fashion 

zz explain the knowledge and skills required to be in fashion business 

zz discuss how a student can prepare for a career in fashion industry

Introduction
Fashion design and merchandising are among the most exciting career 
options in today’s world. In a country like India, where textile industries 
have been thriving for ages, the recent boom in fashion designing has led 
to new prospects in the existing domain of garment and accessory design. 
The fashion industry satisfies both the creative urge and the materialistic 
needs of people. You hear the term Fashion merchandising many times. 
Did you ever think what goes into it? Let us understand merchandising 
from its origin. You can recall from your early history lessons that barter 
of products and crafts was the start of trading practices. Slowly trading 
moved to ‘what was available was saleable’, so there were no complications 

176

in distribution system. However, the year 1920 gave birth to ‘ready-to- wear’ 
and soon retailers realised that sale of such garments was big business. 
In a very short span of time, fashion apparel became the most important 
type of merchandise in department stores. As a result of the economic 
opportunities of fashion, a new specialisation came into being — Fashion 
merchandising. 

Significance 

Fashion design and merchandising will enable you to understand how 
the fashion business works. It includes all the processes involved with 
producing raw material, apparel and accessories, and the retail stores that 
sell fashion merchandise to the public. It is a part of the fashion business 
where you also learn about textiles (fabrics and the fibers used to make 
them). Fashion merchandising equips to

buying and selling’.

Basic concepts 
Fashion today is a big business employing millions of people in 
design, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, retailing, advertising, 
communications, publishing and consulting. To understand fashion 
design, one needs to understand the nature of fashion and how it works. 
The fundamentals of fashion and the relationships between fashion and 
the factors that affect it are also essential concepts to be understood. 

FASHION TERMINOLOGY

Fashion is a complex subject and certain words and phrases are often 
used to discuss various aspects of fashion. These should be understood 
in order to understand the concepts of fashion industry. These include —

zz Fashion is the style or styles most popular at a given time.

zz Style is any particular look or characteristic in apparel or accessories. 
A style may come and go in fashion but the specific style always 
remains.

177

Reprint 2025-26

Unit IV - Fabric And Apparel



zz Fads or short lived fashions, can come and go in a single season. 
They lack the design strength to hold consumer attention for long. 
For example, hot pants, baggy pants and unmatched buttons.

zz Classic or styles that never become completely obsolete, but instead 
remain more or less accepted for an extended period. Classic is 
characterised by simplicity of design, which keeps it from being easily 
dated. Examples of classics include blazer jackets, polo shirts, and 
Chanel suit. 

FASHION DEVELOPMENT
To understand the working of the fashion industry, one has to have 
knowledge of Fashion Fundamentals. First in the sequence is to know 
how the fashion business developed. Thus the history of fashion helps the 
designers to make decisions for the present day and future fashions. Ideas 
from the past are often reinterpreted for today’s fashion. 

Fashion, as we know it, is relatively new. In ancient and medieval 
times, styles remained practically unchanged for a century at a time. 
During Renaissance, Western civilisation discovered different cultures, 
customs and costumes leading to acceleration in fashion change. With the 
availability of new fabrics and ideas, people yearned for more new things.

FRANCE — THE CENTRE OF FASHION 

France’s dominance over international fashion began in early 18th century.

Until Industrial Revolution, people belonged to two main classes: 
wealthy and poor. Only the wealthy could afford fashionable clothes. By 
the turn of 18th century, King Louis XIV’s court members became the 
trendsetters of taste, making Paris the fashion capital of Europe. Many of 
the French cities were supplying the court with silk fabrics, ribbons and 
laces. At this time intricate seaming of fashion required painstaking hand 
sewing. All the clothes were hand made and custom made i.e. made to fit 
the customer’s exact measurements. 

France became the centre of fashion due to support from the royal 
court and the development of the silk industry there. Couture (koo-tour’) 
was the term used for the art of dress making. A male designer was a 
couturier and his female counterpart was a couturiere. 

The Industrial Revolution marked the beginning of technological 
advances in textile and apparel production. Due to the developments more 
fabrics were produced in less time. During this time spinning jenny and 

178 power looms were invented. This gave rise to development of American textile 

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



industry. Rapidly increasing trade and industry in return created a middle 
class with money to spend on the luxuries of life, including better clothing.

The invention of sewing machine turned the handcraft into an industry. 
This democratised fashion and made it accessible for everyone. In 1859, 
Issac Singer developed the foot treadle for the sewing machine which left 
the hands free to guide the fabric. An early use for sewing machines was 
to make Civil War uniforms.

In 1849, fabric intended for tents and wagon covers was used to make 
long wearing pants with pockets for tools by a young boy Levi Strauss. Later 
these became popular and were called denims. This was the beginning of 
clothes specially made for labourers. This is the only apparel that has 
remained same for the last nearly 150 years!

Women started wearing separate skirts and blouses in 1880s. This was 
a step towards manufacture of ready-to-wear clothes for women. Lengths 
and waistlines could be easily adjusted and this made it possible for the 
working class to add variety to their wardrobe simply by mixing separates.

By 19th century affordable fashions were made available to the general 
public through fairs and bazaars. The travelling merchants brought clothes 
to these markets, and both buyers and sellers usually bargained. As large 
number of people settled in towns, general stores were established to cater 
to their demands. With the growing demand for a variety of goods, retail 
stores grew in cities. 

Prêt-à-porter (ready-to-wear) clothing lines were the first radical 
alternative to couture pieces when they hit boutiques in the 1960s. The 
term describes factory-made clothing that is sold in finished condition and 
in standardised sizes (as distinct from bespoke, made-to-measure haute 
couture). Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) is credited as being the first French 
haute couturier to come out with a full prêt-à-porter line.

zz Introduction of a Style — Designers interpret their research and 
creative ideas into apparel and then offer the new styles to the public. 
Designs are created by changing elements such as line, colour, shape, 
fabric and details, and their relationship to one another.

zz Increase in Popularity — As the new fashion is purchased, worn and 
seen by many people, it may begin to rise in popularity.

zz Peak of Popularity — When a fashion is at the height of its popularity, 
it may be in such demand that many manufacturers copy it or produce 
adaptations of it at different price levels.

zz Decline in Popularity — Eventually so many copies are mass produced 
that fashion-conscious people tire of the style and begin to look for 
something new. These declining styles are put on sale racks in the 
retail stores.

zz Rejection of a Style or Obsolescence — In the last phase of the fashion 
cycle, some consumers have already turned to new looks, thus 
beginning a new cycle. 

FASHION MERCHANDISING
Fashion merchandising refers to the planning required to have the right 
merchandise, at the right time, at the right place, at the right price and 
with the right sales promotion.  If all these conditions are planned, one can 
achieve maximum profits.

Fashion Merchandiser is a person who facilitates conversion of 
inspiration into design, uses technology to conceptualise and 
address the planning, production, promotion and distribution of 
products in the fashion industry, to meet the needs and demands 
of a consumer.

To understand fashion merchandising well, it is important to examine 
the role that fashion merchandising plays in manufacturing, buying, 
promoting and selling fashion items. Let us examine the role of the fashion 
merchandiser in each of these aspects.

In manufacturing, a fashion merchandiser makes significant input 
on the types of fabrics used to make a piece of clothing. Having a strong 
historical and socio-cultural understanding of the fabrics helps change a 
designer’s vision into reality. By applying the knowledge about fabric and 
clothing construction, a fashion merchandiser takes a designer’s piece 

180 and finds the best way to manufacture the item, at the same time taking 
things like price and target market into consideration. 

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



Buying becomes part of fashion merchandising when a merchandiser 
buys fashion items to be presented in a store. A fashion merchandiser 
must be aware of the target market for the fashion item and also be very 
well-versed in fashion trend analysis and forecasting. This allows for more 
accurate ordering. A fashion merchandiser working with a designer will 
once again offer expertise to the designer on textiles and fabrics.

In the event that a fashion merchandiser is working for the designer, 
promoting the designer’s product to stores that may want to buy large 
quantities is a number one priority role. Not only is the fashion merchandiser 
required to have a creative mind and strong visual merchandising skills, 
production skills must be sharp as well. Fashion merchandising promotes 
a designer’s items through the use of fashion shows where creations and 
visual effects are exaggerated to capture the attention of potential buyers. 
Additionally, fashion merchandisers seek out the target market for a 
designer’s clothing, such as children’s clothing stores, department stores 
or discount retailers.

The final component of fashion merchandising is selling. 
A fashion merchandiser who works with a designer is responsible for 
selling fashion items to stores, which then sell to consumers. Again the 
merchandiser must have an idea about forecasting and market trends to 
give recommendations regarding production of the item. Creativity is 
important because a merchandiser must offer suggestions on how to 
display the items within the store. When a fashion merchandiser works for 
a retail store, responsibilities include buying and presenting fashion items 
within the store.

Merchandising takes place at several levels. In fashion industry there 
are three Levels of Merchandising

zz Retail Organisation Merchandising — It is a specialised management 
function within the fashion industry. It is the business that moves 
the fashion world from designers’ showroom to retail sales floor and 
into the hands of consumers. It is achieved by the internal planning 
that takes place within a retail organisation. It ensures that adequate 
amount of merchandise are on hand and sold at prices that the 
consumers are willing to pay to ensure a profitable operation.

zz Buying Agency Merchandising provides services for goods buying 
consultancy. Buying agency acts as procurement office for the buyers. 
Selling through buying agencies is profitable for exporters as it helps 
in significant cost and time saving. The responsibility of the buying 
agent is to identify vendors, negotiate costs, check in-process quality, 
and perform pre-shipment quality inspection. They keep a regular 
control over quality during production process.

181

Reprint 2025-26

Unit IV - Fabric And Apparel



zz Export House Merchandising — To understand this it is best to 
understand the role of a merchandiser in an export house. There 
are two types of merchandisers in an export house — the buyer 
merchandiser and the production merchandiser. The buyer 
merchandisers act as a link between the buyer and the manufacturer. 
They have the responsibility of ensuring that the product is developed 
as per the requirements of the buyer. So they have the responsibility of 
sourcing, sampling and communication with the buyer. The production 
merchants on the other hand, are a link between production and buyer 
merchants. They have the responsibility of ensuring that the production 
goes according to the schedule and requirements of the buyer.

Other concepts and requirements in fashion merchandising that one 
needs to understand are:

Target Market : It is defined as category of consumers one is targeting at for 
selling the product. It is essential to understand the target market as this 
will allow the sales department to focus on that category of consumers who 
are ‘most likely’ to purchase the offering. It is also to insure the highest 
return for the marketing/sales expenditures. 

This can be done through Market segmentation. Market segmentation is 
a strategy that involves dividing a larger market into subsets of consumers 
who have common needs and applications for the goods and services offered 
in the market.

Market can be segmented in various ways — 

Demographic Segmentation is on the basis of Population, Age, 
Sex, Occupation, Education and Income. 

Geographic Segmentation is on the basis of cities, states and 
regions. Climate of various places may vary and it plays an important 
role as choice of merchandise, especially as selection of clothes is 
climate dependent.

Psychographic Segmentation is on the basis of lifestyle like social 
activities, interests, leisure pursuits, needs and wants. People 
having similar lifestyles can make up a target market group.

Behavioural Segmentation is on the basis of opinion on specific 
products or services. Many times rating of usage of products and 
services is done. This helps in improving the service/product and 
make it different from others.

As a merchandiser one needs to interpret consumer demand also. 
182 There is a need to understand what customers’ buying motivations are.

Merchandising Rights

Right Merchandise: Retailers must fill their shelves with the 
merchandise that the customer wants. 

At Right Place: The location of the merchandise is of prime importance 
since it decides accessibility.

At Right Time: Much merchandise is seasonal in nature and must 
be on hand when it is most needed.

In Right Quantity: This means a profitable balance between volume 
of sales and amount of inventory.

Right Price: Merchandiser must arrive at a price that is high enough 
to give the store profit and yet low enough to meet the competition 
and customers’ expectations.

With Right Promotion: Right balance between investment and the 
appeal created for the customers ensures successful promotion.

Fashion Retail Organisations — Overview of retailing

Organisational Structure includes a clear understanding of the authority 
and responsibility for each job to be done. Organisational system differs 
with the difference in type of merchandise, size of retail firm and target 
customer.

Preparing for a career

For the reason that this career combines style with business sense, a 
flair for fashion (alone) will not bring you success. Rather, there are three 
primary (and divergent) skills that a fashion designer, merchandiser and 
marketer must possess in order to succeed in this field.

zz Forecasting ability. The ability to forecast fashion trends is an essential 
part of this career. This requires a thorough knowledge of past future 
trends, current future trends (as represented by sometimes minute 
changes within the fashion industry) and an awareness of how the 
marketing of an item contributes to these fashion trends. Moreover, 
they must be able to keep well ahead of these fashion trends to 
capitalise on them in time.

zz Analytical ability. Fashion merchandisers and marketers must be 
able to analyse the ‘dollars and sense’ part of their jobs. This means 
that they must keep abreast of the economy as a whole, the economy 
of their particular companies, and how certain styles will fit into a 
consumer’s budget. They must juggle a complex set of factors to 
ensure that they make a profit for their employers.

184

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



zz Communication ability. Excellent communication skills are absolutely 
essential in this field. They must be able to negotiate prices with 
manufacturers and sell their fashion choices to the public. To this 
end, they frequently write advertising copy, press releases, and 
even personalised letters to consumers. All of this takes skilled 
communication skills.

Fashion designers typically need an associate or a bachelor’s degree in 
fashion design. Some fashion designers also combine a fashion design degree 
with a business, marketing, or fashion merchandising degree, especially 
those who want to run their own business or retail store. There are several 
different degree programmes in fashion design and merchandising. You 
can earn a certificate, a diploma, an associate’s, or a bachelor’s degree in 
this field. Your choice depends upon a number of factors that take into 
consideration the unique qualities of each degree programme.

zz Certificate or diploma degree programmes in fashion merchandising 
can usually be completed in 6 months to 1 year. The programme 
duration is so short because the coursework will focus on the actual 
job of fashion merchandising. A certificate or diploma programme 
may suit you if you do not have the patience for long-term schooling 
and if you want to be able to enter the fashion field more quickly.

zz Fashion Merchandising related degrees are 2-year Master’s 
programmes that combine a certain amount of liberal arts (or general 
educational) requirements with fashion and business courses. 

zz Bachelors’ degrees in fashion design or fashion merchandising are 
4-year programmes that combine a substantial amount of liberal 
arts requirements with fashion and business courses. If you have the 
patience for long-term schooling, the desire for a broad education and 
yearning for various promotional opportunities, a bachelor’s degree 
may be suitable for you.

Scope 
Many are attracted to pursue a career in the fashion industry due to 
lucrative income opportunities. In addition, the idea that you can succeed 
on your own, further motivates aspirants. As a matter of fact, about 
one-third of professional fashion designers are self-employed.

In general, fashion designer professionals have innate artistic and 
creative qualities. They use their creative gifts and artistic talents to create 
unique design concepts for various fashion applications. Today, fashion

designer professionals are in demand in a variety of industries. Since there 
is a constant demand for fashion designers specialising in a particular 
field, most of the aspirants focus their talent in one specialised fashion 
area like interior designing, merchandise displays, clothing/apparel, 
theatre sets and many more. You need to always equip yourself with fresh 
and new ideas since market and fashion trends are constantly changing.

Currently, there are a number of fashion design careers available. 
Some of the popular fashion design careers that you could consider are as 
follows:

zz Visual Merchandise Designers: They are mainly responsible 
for designing window displays, arranging store merchandise, 
creating props and accents, organising clothing placement, styling 
mannequins, and spearheading marketing campaigns.

zz Fashion Designers: Those working as fashion designer professionals 
are typically tasked to create designs for clothing and apparel. Some 
work with popular fashion designers while others manage their own 
fashion labels.

zz Set Designer: As the name implies, set designers are primarily 
assigned to conceptualise designs needed for movies, television and 
theatre productions. Their styles and designs must always be in line 
with what the script or the director requires. Some set designers 
produce unique set designs for trade shows and museums.

zz Interior Designer: The main goal of interior designers is to perfectly 
combine form with function. Their primary function is to introduce 
interior concepts that will increase the beauty, safety and functionality 
of a particular space or area. Interior designers work in a variety of 
settings including retail stores, residential homes, offices, hospitals, 
hotels and many more.

Theme:  Developing a female fashion figure

Task:  To learn sketching of a fashion figure and proportions

Purpose: This practical will help students to understand the proportions 
of different parts of the body to create a figure. This would result in a form, 
on which they can communicate their design ideas for apparel. Fashion 
figure is referred to as croquis (which means an outline or rough sketch). 
Croquis is constructed using head as the unit of measurement. Fashion 
figure has 8 ½ to 10 heads as its full size. Multiples of head are taken 
as the measure for different proportions of different parts of the body. 
Basic head measurements will vary depending on the fashion look at a 
particular time.

Requirements: Sketch file and pencils. 

Conducting the Practical 

Croqui proportions are as follows—

zz Shoulders are widest 

zz Waist is smallest 

zz Hips are in between the two

Care and Maintenance of 
Fabrics in Institutions

Learning Objectives
After completing this section the learner will be able to —

zz discuss the significance of care and maintenance of fabrics and textile 
products

zz describe the concept of care and maintenance of fabrics in hospitals 
and hotels

zz explain the process and various equipments required and their usage 

zz discuss how a student can prepare for a career in this field.

Introduction
The use of fabrics in a family setup for apparel and household is well known. 
You may also be aware that some special fabrics are used for industrial 
purposes, for interiors in institutions for heat and sound insulation and 
for bandages, masks etc. in hospitals. Since fabrics with specific properties 
are selected for specific usage and functionality, it becomes important 
that these characteristics are retained for the expected life of the material. 
Efforts are also made to prolong the period of the serviceability of the 
product by taking good care of them. Care and maintenance of fabrics 
includes two aspects:

Reprint 2025-26



zz Keeping the material free of physical damage and rectifying any 
damage that may have occurred during its use.

zz Retaining or refreshing the appearance in terms of removal of stains 
and dirt and retaining the textural and visual characteristics.

Basic Concepts

Clean fresh hygienic clothes, spotless and crisp household linen 
are the outcome of successful laundering or dry-cleaning. Laundry 
is both a science and an art. It is a science because it is based 
on application of scientific principles and techniques. It is also an 
art since its application requires the mastering of certain skills to 
produce aesthetically pleasing results.

You are aware that care and maintenance requirements of different 
fabrics depend on its fibre content, type of yarn and fabric construction 
techniques, the finishes given to the fabrics and the purpose for which 
they are used. You are also aware of the process of laundry, stain removal, 
role of water — suitability of soaps and detergents, methods of washing, 
finishing treatments, ironing and hot pressing, folding. Let us now briefly 
discuss the equipments required for these activities. There are mainly 
three types of equipments in common use:

A. Washing Equipment

B. Drying Equipment

C. Ironing/Pressing Equipment

At household level, a large amount of washing is done manually, 
using equipments like buckets, basins, bowls and scrubbing boards and 
brushes. In some cases, basic washing machines have been added. 

A. Washing Equipment

 Two types of models of washing machines are available — top loading 
(where the garments are put into the machine from the top) and 
front loading (where the garments are put in the machine from the 
front side).

Activity 1

Do a survey of types of washing machines available in the market. 
Collect pictures and paste them in the given boxes. 191

Unit IV - Fabric And Apparel



   

 Top Loading Front Loading Two Tub 

 Washing Machine Washing Machine Machine  

 

These machines may further be:

(a)z Fully automatic: These machines have a single time setting of 
controls for each use i.e water filling, temperature of water, wash 
cycle and number of rinses. No further intervention of the operator is 
required.

(b)z Semi-automatic: These machines require intervention of the 
operator at frequent intervals. Rinse water in such machines has to 
be filled and drained out with each cycle. These are generally two-tub 
machines.

(c)z Manually operated: In these machines, 50 per cent or more of the 
work is manually done by the operator.

Automatic Washer performs the following operations

a. Filling up water.

b. Water Level Control is also an important feature. The water level is 
controlled either automatically or manually.

c. Regulation of Temperature of Water: The machine has a button, dial 
or panel indication which permits selection of desired temperature 
of the water. The temperature may be same for wash and rinse or 
different for the two operations. 

d. Washing: 

z The principle of all washing machines is to keep the fabric in movement 
in the washing solution to carry away the dirt. The major methods of 
this are:

i. Agitation — This is used in top loading machines. The agitator 
has blades which may rotate (movement in one direction) or 

192

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



oscillate (alternate movement in two directions) which cause the 
creation of a current in the tub, forcing water into the fabric.

ii. Pulsation — This is also used in top loading machines. The 
movement is caused by a vertical pulsator, which has very rapid 
movements vertically.

iii. Tumbling — This is used in front loading machines. Washing 
takes place in a horizontally placed cylinder which is perforated 
and which revolves in a partially filled tub. With each revolution 
the clothes are carried to the top and then dropped in the wash 
water. This means that the clothes move through the water 
rather than water moving through clothes as in the previous 
two types. 

z Depending on the size of the machine and the type of fabrics to be 
treated, the agitators may be made of plastic, metal (aluminium) 
or bakelite, and are such that they are not affected by detergents, 
bleaches, softeners etc. Agitation speed can also be varied depending 
on the type of fabric.

e. Rinsing

z This is the important phase in the wash cycle. If the rinse is not 
thorough, the clothes may look grey and dull and have a harsh 
texture.

f. Water Extraction

z Water is extracted after the wash phase and after each rinse phase of 
the cycle. It can be done in three ways:

i.z Spinning: Spinning at speeds greater than 300 rpm, which 
generates a centrifugal force which in turn throws the water up 
and out. This water is pumped down the drain.

ii.z Bottom-drain: Machines with perforated tubs stop at the end of 
wash phase and then at the end of the rinse phase and drain 
through the bottom. At the end of the drain period, the tub 
begins to spin as described above which removes the remaining 
water from clothes.

iii.z Combination Bottom-drain and Spin: Some machines drain 
through the bottom without stopping i.e. the bottom draining 
occurs during the spin period. This system provides the best 
water extraction because it can remove the heavy dirt at the 
bottom and dirt in suspension in water. 

193

Reprint 2025-26

Unit IV - Fabric And Apparel



z The amount of water extracted from the clothes during spinning 
is directly affected by the speed at which the tub spins. The speed 
can vary from 333 –1100 rpm. Spinning to near dryness is avoided 
because it may cause wrinkles which are difficult to remove during 
ironing. The optimum speed is approximately 600–620 rpm.

B. Drying Equipment and Process 

z Apart from drying in the open, driers are used at commercial and 
institutional level.

z There are two types of circulation systems in driers:

(a)z Air of relatively low temperature is circulated at high velocity. 
Room air enters the drier from under the front panel, passes 
over the source of heat and then through the clothes and leaves 
through an exhaust. Thus the temperature and humidity of the 
room stays normal.

(b)z Air of high temperature is circulated slowly. In this after the air 
enters the drier and passes over the heat source, it is drawn by 
a small fan through perforations at the top of the drier, then 
downwards through the clothes and out through the exhaust. 
Since the movement of the air in this drier is slow, the relative 
humidity of the exhausted air is high.

C. Ironing and Hot pressing

z Most households have an iron and a temporary or permanent place 
for work. Ironing is the process of smoothening out wrinkles created 
with use or during washing. Pressing helps to put creases such as 
in sleeves, trouser legs and pleated skirts. Irons have smooth metal 
surface which can be heated. Most electric irons have an inbuilt 
thermostat, which can adjust the temperature to suit the fabric. The 
iron may also have a system of producing steam while in use. The 
weight of the iron varies from 1.5–3.5 kgs. At household level light 
weight irons are preferred. Heavier articles like curtains, bed covers 
etc. may require heavier irons. 

Though in most cases the heating is with electricity, in India one 
can still see some charcoal irons. Charcoal iron is like a metal box 
with a lid, in which live coal pieces are put to heat the iron.

z Care and maintenance of apparel and articles of household usage 
within the family may be done at different levels. Household laundry 
takes care of clothing and small articles of daily use. Bigger articles 
of household linen and some special articles are sent to commercial 
laundries. Sometimes services are hired of individual professionals 
who collect material from household for washing and/or ironing and 
finishing. Such professional 
(often called dhobis) serve

work from their homes. For the maintenance activities done

dhobighats.

The concept of individual workers grew up into ‘Laundries’ or ‘Dry-
cleaning’ shops. Here the customer takes the articles for cleaning and 
comes back a few days later to collect finished articles. The customer may 
be an individual or an institution. Bigger laundries often have several 
centers or shops in different parts of the city. Some laundries also provide 
services of transport of material to and from the customer. This is specially 
so in the case of institutions like hostels, small hotels, restaurants and 
also small hospitals and nursing homes.

The commercial laundries are organised in different sections. Each 
section deals with a specific job, such as washing, water extraction, drying, 
pressing and ironing. Some laundries may have a separate section for 
hospital and institutional work, and another for individual and personal 
work. They also may have separate sections for dry-cleaning, for fibre 
specific articles like woolens, silks and synthetics, and for special articles 
like blankets and carpets. Some laundries also have arrangement for dyeing 
and special finishes like zari polishing. Most laundries would have units 
for inspection, sorting out of materials and taking care of pretreatments 
like mending, repairing and stain removal.

These laundries have bigger equipment and in larger numbers. The 
washing machines have the capacity to handle 100 kg or more of load 
in one cycle (as against 5 –10 kgs in domestic washing machines). They 
have separate machines or dry-cleaning. Other equipments include hydro 
extractors, driers, flat bed ironing and pressing equipment, roller ironing 

195

Reprint 2025-26

and calendaring machines, folding and packaging tables and trolleys to 
carry material from one place to another.

The commercial establishments have a system of keeping record. 
When the article is received, it is checked and any damage or special care 
requirement is recorded. The customer is given an invoice for the kind 
and number of articles received and the date of delivery. System of code 
tags matching the invoice helps to identify the items of each customer or 
invoice.

Institutions
Large institutions that require a constant flow of clean linen, working-
clothing or uniform, like hospitals, prisons and hotels, will usually have 
their own laundry departments. The organised collection, laundering and 
timely delivery of processed material is essential to the operation of the 
institution.

There are two types of institutions which have in-house laundry and 
maintenance setups, i.e., within their organisation. These are hotels 
and hospitals. Both have a large quantum of bed linen and other room 
furnishing requirements as also staff uniforms and accessories such as 
aprons, caps, head dresses and masks.

The hospital laundry takes care of hygiene, cleanliness and disinfection. 
However, a number of hospitals have started using disposables where 
there is a threat of infection, which are then destroyed by burning. Most 
of the articles in hospitals are of cotton and dyed (in colours specific to the 
hospital and department) with dyes which have excellent wash-fastness. 
Only the blankets are woolen. The daily laundry thus emphasises mainly 
on cleanliness of cotton materials. Here too the stubborn stains may not be 
taken notice of and finishing like starching and whitening is not included. 
Even the ironing and pressing may not be done to perfection. Repair and 
mending and condemnation of unusable material may or may not form a 
part of the services required.

In the hospitality sector, i.e. for hotel and restaurants, aesthetics and 
final finish of the articles are the most important. As compared to hospitals 
the articles here may be of different fibre contents. Final finishing of 
laundered goods, i.e., starching, ironing pressing and correct and perfect 
folding, are emphasised. They also have to care of guests’ personal laundry 
when required. As mentioned earlier the smaller hotels may have link ups 
with commercial laundries from outside.

which gets rid of 60 –70% moisture. 

6. Drying

7. Pressing, ironing, folding and stacking

8. Mending and segregation of condemned articles

9. Packing

10. Distribution

The quantum of work, especially for bed linen, is much larger for 
hospitals as compared to hotels. The big hotels may have upto 400–500 
rooms.The larger hospitals may have to take care of 1,800–2,000 beds 
or even more. Of these, sheets in Operation Theater, Maternity ward and 
Labour room may require 5 or more changes per day. Linen requirement 
in stock is a minimum of six sets per bed. Each set normally consists of 
bed sheet, draw sheet and a pillow slip. The blankets are not changed daily 
unless soiled. Apart from linen for patient’s bed, the other articles to be 
laundered are dress (gowns, kurta, pyjamas etc.) for patients, dress (coats, 
gowns, kurta and pyjama) for doctors (that is generally a different colour 
from dress for patients and may be of tericot material), and some general 
material like table cloths and curtains.

As in the case of commercial laundries there is a system of keeping 
record for collection and disbursement of material to each department. An 
example is given as follows.

Preparing for a career
The field of Care and Maintenance of Fabrics is a technical field. The 
primary requirements are:

zz Knowledge of the material, i.e., its fibre content, yarn and fabric 
production technique, and the colour and finishes applied, in terms 

198 of the effect of care required.

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



zz Knowledge of the processes involved.

zz Knowledge of the chemicals and other reagents used in the process 
and their effect on the fabric.

zz Working knowledge of the machinery requirements and its 
functioning.

Generally, Laundry Management courses are short term programmes, 
which offer coaching, job placement assistance, assistance to start business, 
practical training with stipend in hi-tech laundry, job opportunities in 
airways, ship, railways, hotels and hi-tech hospitals. However, since each 
setup may have different types of equipment and different requirements, 
a practical training or internship would be required. Qualifications in 
Textile Science, Textile Chemistry, Fabric and Apparel would be extremely 
useful. These courses are offered as specialisation for the graduate degree 
by several institutions throughout the country that offer Home Science.

Scope 
This is one area where persons with specialisation in Textiles and Clothing, 
Fabric and Apparel can venture into entrepreneurial activities. These 
services provide much needed help and support for the end users, in 
metropolitan areas especially where women are working outside the home. 
There may also be a large 
number of nursing homes, 
small hospitals, day care 
centres etc. which would need 
such services on a regular 
basis. One may also choose 
to work in hi-tech laundries 
of railways, airways, shipping 
lines, hotels and hospitals, i.e., 
institutions and organisations 
that have in house program 
for care and maintenance of 
fabrics and textiles.

Unit V - Resource Management



Introduction

Resource Management focuses on the allocation and utilisation of human 
and non-human resources to achieve the goals of the individual and family 
in any organisation. It emphasises areas in consumer and family finance, 
ergonomics, design and management of interior and exterior spaces 
including environment as well as hospitality and event management. 
Students are taught to appreciate the importance of Ergonomics and its 
applications in the home, in public places and in industries. 

All of us aspire to have a good standard of living and quality of life. This 
implies that as consumers we expect all products and services that we need 
and utilise are of good quality. When we purchase goods or products we 
often need advice. When we have any problems we need professionals who 
can help us to sort out the problems by approaching consumer guidance 
and counselling centers. 

In addition, families as well as organisations need assistance for 
organising and conducting various events. You will find many events taking 
place in different parts of the country, varying from launching of products, 
film previews, launching of government schemes, marathons, fund raising, 
exhibitions, conferences, among many others such as weddings, parties, 
celebrations, etc. Persons/organisations that are responsible for these 
can approach and avail of professional services to organise such events. 
With increasing number of events in cities, metros and rural areas, event 
management is now becoming a specialty profession. 

For any function, hospitality is an integral part of services and is 
required on daily basis whether it is a hotel, hospital or other related 
service organisations, such as hostels, service apartments and corporate 
houses, among others. This has opened up numerous career opportunities 
for persons at various hierarchal levels. Many companies today are looking 
for outsourcing hospitality related activities. Therefore, these areas offer 
tremendous potential for entrepreneurial ventures. 

Whatever we do and wherever we work, performance and productivity 
are vital for success. Hence the role of human resource management is a 
critical component. Besides this, all of us like to work and live in attractive, 
user friendly places. This can be made possible by well-planned and 
managed spaces, both indoors and outdoors. Interior designers can help to 
render services to people/organisations for designing spaces. Similarly, the 
exterior of any building or place, parks, conversion of waste land to green 
zones are required to be done by landscape designers. The Interior Design 
course focusses on drafting and arranging as well as creating interiors of 
private and commercial spaces. It also prepares students to significantly 

206 and positively address local, regional and global environmental issues 
concerned with sustainable living and to create new ways to enhance the 
environmental concerns.

Introduction

When we go to a restaurant or hotel, we expect to be greeted and served 
properly. If not, we are unlikely to repeat the visit. In Indian culture guests 
are regarded as God-like and treated accordingly, as encapsulated in the 
words “Athithi Devo Bhava”. This implies that each and every guest must 
be received with warmth and given the best possible care and service in 
all respects. In ancient times, people generally stayed with relations or 
friends or in ‘dharmashalas’. However, in modern times, increasing trade 
and commerce within the country and between different countries has 
necessitated provision of paid services for hospitality.

Significance

With globalisation, the world has become a small place, where people 
travel from one place to another, within the country, and internationally 
for many reasons. It may be for business purposes, marketing products, 
for official purposes, study, pilgrimages, seeking health care (medical 
tourism), enjoying leisure time/vacation, visiting relatives or for shopping. 
Some people travel to see various places especially for experiencing 
different cultures, seeing heritage monuments, wildlife or natural beauty. 
You must have seen attractive advertisements for festivals like shopping 
festivals, wildlife tours etc. and photographs of people who come from 
many different places for events like the Pushkar and Kumbh melas, the 
Dusshera festival in Mysore, the Ganapati festival in Mumbai and Pune 
etc. All people who visit/participate in such events need a place to stay that 
is comfortable, safe and hygienic. If not, one carries unpleasant memories. 
Hence, tourists (Tourist is one who travels and stays temporarily in another 
place) need comforts and facilities similar or close enough to what they are 
accustomed to at home. The hospitality industry, hence, has grown to 
provide “A Home Away From Home” and this is one of the fastest growing 
industries.

Let us now explore the world of the hospitality industry and 
understand the efforts that the industry must make so that the tourists 
feel comfortable.

Basic Concepts

Let us start with the term ‘Hospitality’. Hospitality is the relationship between 
the guest and the host. It is the act/practice of being hospitable including 
friendly generous reception/welcoming of guests, their entertainment 
and providing services with warmth and courteousness. It is basically 
concerned with providing a place to stay, food, entertainment and other 
facilities to make the stay comfortable. Different types of establishments 
offer hospitality services e.g., hotels, motels, lodges, resorts, and furnished 
apartments. 

zz A hotel is a commercial establishment offering lodging, meals and 
other services to its guests. 

zz A motel provides services like a hotel and provides parking facility 
near the room or a room door that opens out onto the parking lot.

zz A lodge offers rented accommodation especially for sleeping and may 
not offer food and other services.

zz A resort is known for its leisure attraction. It offers a broad range of 
amenities, sports facilities and leisure activities for ensuring a total 
vacation experience.

zz Furnished apartments provide all essential amenities needed by the 
guests.

zz Furnished camps provide hospitality to people who go hiking, 
undertake adventure sports etc.

In addition to these, hospitality services are integral to the services 
provided at conventions, conferences and other events including weddings 
and parties, theme parks, cruise lines, amusement parks as well as guest 
houses, hospitals. Organisations which provide hospitality generally have 
management departments. Hospitality services are also provided by hostels. 
The fundamental principles of hospitality management are applicable to 
one and all. In order to have smooth and efficient functioning the tasks 
are carried out by different sectors or departments as shown in Fig. 17.1.

In order to have a better understanding of the different departments it 
is necessary to understand the concept of “Guest Cycle”. 

What is the Guest Cycle? The “Guest Cycle” starts even before 
the guests physically steps into a hotel and it consists of four stages 
(Fig. 17.2). 

1. Pre-arrival stage — The activities done in the pre-arrival stage include: 
(i) quoting rates for a guest (ii) reserving a room as a part of central 
reservation system or reservation department.

2. Arrival Stage — In this stage, as the title suggests, the guest actually 
arrives and registers or checks-in.

3. Occupancy — This stage consists of providing various services as 
per the guest’s requirements, ensuring security of the guest and co-
ordination of various guest services. Guest satisfaction is the main 
focus in order to ensure and encourage the guest to patronise and 
use the services of the establishment again; in other words, to obtain 
and retain ‘customer loyalty’.

is ready to leave/move out or “check-out” of the accommodation. An 
up-to-date record of the room occupancy of the guest is kept along

including feedback from the guest about his/her opinion about the 
services.

Departments Involved In Hospitality Management of an Organisation

Front office: The guest cycle falls largely under the domain of Front Office. 
The guest arrives at the front office and comes in contact with the staff of 
the hospitality industry for the first time. Interaction between the guest 
and the staff is very critical to develop good relationship between the guest 
and the organisation and also in building a good image. Hence, the front 
office is the focal point of any hotel. 

The services offered by the staff here include — welcoming guests, 
meeting and greeting them, organising reservation status of room availability, 
registering guests and allocation of rooms, maintaining records of check-in 
and check-out details, porter services, issuing room keys to guests, passing 
messages to customers, coordinating with other guest services, providing 
in-house and external information to the guests, and preparing and 
settling their bills. The manner in which the services are offered plays a 
central role in image building of the institution and ultimately determines 
the revenue generated. Would you like to be greeted/served by a person 
who is expressionless and indifferent? Not at all! The front office staff 
also coordinate with various departments for providing services to guests 
such as the Transport for assisting the guest with transport, Accounts, 
Billing, Room service, Restaurants, Engineering, Stores, Sales and 
Housekeeping departments. The organisational chart of Front office is 
shown in Fig. 17.3.

Housekeeping Department: Housekeeping department is primarily 
responsible for providing a healthy environment by ensuring cleanliness 
and maintaining high standards of hygiene along with ensuring that the 
aesthetics of the entire establishment are maintained. The guest’s decision 
to stay and repeatedly visit the hotel in future largely depends upon the 
quality of the services provided. In case of hotels, room decor, facilities 
provided within the rooms, safety, cleanliness and hygiene are most 
important. 

Nowadays, many organisations, including corporate offices, are hiring 
housekeeping services on contractual basis. This provides an avenue for 
many people to start their own enterprise. When housekeeping consultancy 
is done on a commercial basis, it has a greater volume of activities and 
challenges. The work of maintaining numerous rooms and public areas 
becomes a gigantic and complex task. In order to provide valuable services 
to the client, it is essential to plan and organise the department with 
various sections and trained staff. 

Functions of Housekeeping Department

As the prime function is to maintain cleanliness and space hygiene, it is 
responsible for the following —

zz Cleaning of public areas and guestrooms

zz Supply, upkeep of laundry and exchange of various linen and 
uniforms.

zz Coordination and communication with other departments such as 
front office, restaurants, engineering, accounts, etc., through control 
desk.

zz Pest control is also the responsibility of this department.

In order to perform these functions efficiently, the housekeeping 
department is divided into sections, which are as follows:

1.  Housekeeping control desk — passes on the information to 
housekeeping staff who are working in various parts of the hotel.

2.  Housekeeping management — plans, organises and controls all the 
activities of the housekeeping department.

3.  Guestroom brigade — upkeeps and cleans the guestrooms.

4.  Public area brigade — maintains cleanliness of foyer, lobby, front 
office and other common areas.

5.  Linen and uniform room — coordinates with laundry; responsible for 
providing clean linen to entire establishment and uniform to all the 
staff.

6.  Horticulture and flower arrangement team — maintains landscape of 
the hotel and arranges flowers in rooms and at various places. 

7.  Lost and found section — deposits misplaced luggage of guests.

Staffing pattern of Housekeeping Department
In order to run the department efficiently it is essential to select appropriate 
manpower to match the various posts within. The organisational chart as 
given in Fig. 17.4 shows the staff hierarchy in a hotel. The organisational 
structure and hierarchy may vary from one organisation / hotel to another. 
One may appoint different individuals in different posts or have some staff 
‘multi-tasking’.

3. Desk control supervisor — coordinates with front office for information 
on departure of guests, gets vacated rooms cleaned and hands over 
cleaned rooms. This desk should be manned 24 hours, as guests and 
staff contact this desk to receive or transmit information any time.

4. Floor supervisor — There is one supervisor for each floor, responsible 
for cleanliness and maintenance of guest rooms, corridors, and 
staircase and floor pantries.

5. Room attendant — does actual cleaning of guest rooms and bath 
rooms. Housemen perform the heavy cleaning activities such as 
vacuuming, mopping, sweeping, shifting of furniture.

required in various parts of the hotel.

Cleaning is an integral part of any organisation/office/hotel, hence 
it involves planning and having a well-organised approach in selecting 
staff with practical housekeeping operational skills with correct cleaning 
procedures and skill to do the task well under a qualified superviser to 
ensure quality services. Appropriate selection of specialised equipment, 
tools, and cleaning solutions and knowledge of latest technological 
applications is an essential part of training. The cleaning activities are 
performed either on daily, weekly, monthly or seasonal basis.

Cleaning of various surfaces in the hotel is done with suitable tools, 
cleaning solutions and specific methods. Various materials and finishes 
used for wall, floor, counter tops and furniture are wood, granite, marble, 
ceramic tiles, stones, linoleum, plastic, vinyl, fibre glass, metals, leather, 
cane, rubber, cloth, paints, wall papers, etc. Various equipments are needed 
for keeping good cleanliness. The commonly used equipments are vacuum 
cleaners, various types of brushes, brooms and mops, containers, cleaning 
cloth and trolleys to carry multiple equipments. Various cleaning agents 
such as water, ammonia, vinegar, soaps and detergents, washing soda, 
abrasives, polishes, acids and other such liquids are used for cleaning 
various surfaces and materials. One should be very cautious while using 
these cleaning agents. Some strong agents may damage the surface 
while cleaning the material hence choice of appropriate cleaning agents 
is important.

The linen and uniform room is an integral part of the house keeping 
department. The laundry may be done in the department if facilities are 
provided. Otherwise it can be given to an outside agency. The linen room 
stores and maintains enough stock of bed linen, bath linen, linen for 
restaurant(s) etc. and uniforms of all the staff members of the hotel. 

Flowers are used to enhance the aesthetic appeal of various interior 
spaces. The establishment may give a contract to florists to supply flower 
arrangements regularly. Alternatively the flower arrangements in various 
areas of the premises may be made by the housekeeping department. 

Activity 2

Visit a hotel to see the flower arrangement(s) done at various places 
such as restaurant, banquet hall, reception, centre table of a 
meeting room, dais of a conference table etc. Note down the size of 
the arrangement and placement.

In many hotels, staff is trained for environmental conservation and 
eco-friendly practices such as using 100% organic cotton bed sheets, 
chemical-free laundry cycle and using agents which are non-toxic, water-
based, hypoallergenic and biodegradable. Cards are put in hotel rooms 
urging the reuse of towels, promoting the saving of natural resources like 
water, electricity, detergent used for laundering. Use of energy-efficient 
light bulbs in rooms can help save electricity.

Food and Beverages Department

The Food and Beverages department is responsible for the sale of food 
and beverages. The relevant service departments involved are kitchen(s), 
banquets, restaurants, room service, stewarding and bars/coffee shops etc.

Kitchen is the place where food is prepared. In large hotels the 
kitchen may have independent sections for various aspects related to 
food preparations, such as butchery (to deal with raw meat), bakery and 
confectionery, vegetable preparations, soups section, pantry, hot range and 
so on. In smaller hotels the kitchen would combine the sections. In large 
establishments there could be various staff (kitchen crew) in the kitchen. 
The executive chef (Chef-de-cuisine) is the head of the kitchen responsible 
for planning, organising and controlling the kitchen operations. The next 
is the deputy chef. There are supervisors for some sections of the kitchen 
called “Chef-de-parties”. Then there are number of cooks who make the 

218 common food items. The restaurant personnel coordinate closely with the 
kitchen for the supply of food orders to guests.

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



Kitchen Stewarding is concerned with the storage, maintenance, 
cleanliness and issue of cutlery, crockery and glassware to the restaurant 
and kitchen. It is the responsibility of this department to maintain 
cleanliness in the kitchen and to wash the pots and pans used. This 
department may have an executive kitchen steward, kitchen steward, 
dishwasher, pot washer and utility workers to clean the kitchen. Those 
working in this department must have high standards of grooming, hygiene 
and sanitation, and good manners and basic etiquette. Each hotel serves 
different varieties of food and beverages to the customers.

Restaurant is a commercial facility that provides food and beverages to 
the customers. It is equipped with dining tables, chairs and other required 
furniture with crockery, cutlery, linen and décor, varying in quality as 
suited to the objectives, concept and standards of the establishment. The 
restaurant has various staff members. A restaurant manager is responsible 
for overall functioning of the restaurant. The senior Restaurant supervisor 
and Head Waiter lead a team of waiters/stewards who actually serve the 
food and the assistant waiter who clears the table. They see that the standard 
of cleanliness, hygiene and service are maintained. They have to be smiling, 
courteous to the guests and possess good manners and etiquette. They 
should have thorough knowledge of the ways of serving the food. 

Support Service Departments 

A hotel has other departments which provide support and are involved 
in the overall management and efficient functioning of the hotel. These 
departments which may also be referred to as ‘back office’ departments 
are: Finance and Accounts, Engineering, Human Resources department, 
Sales and Marketing departments. Thus, a hotel has various departments 
having complex relationships amongst them. The smooth functioning of 
the organisation requires efficient management of man, material and other 
resources.

Management Functions 

The management functions are planning, organising, co-ordinating, 
staffing, directing, controlling and evaluating the use of resources in light 
of the goals of the institution. Each of these functions have been briefly 
discussed in the chapter on Catering Management.

the hospitality industry. Youth form the major part of workforce. Hotels 
prefer youth because they have high energy to work for long hours, as 
compared to middle aged people. They are better informed and have better 
competencies through advancement in education. They are open to new 
ideas and latest technologies. They have ambition for success and earn 
high monetary returns. Since hospitality industry is fast growing, there are 
ample opportunities for you to be absorbed in this field. The fundamentals 
of hospitality management are applicable to hostels and large hospitals 
also.

The essential competencies required to work in this industry are: 
The staff needs to be well groomed, have good hygiene, orderliness, good 
manners and etiquettes besides a smiling face. The cheerful attitude, self 
discipline, courtesy, physical fitness and good communication skills along 
with self-confidence and multiple language skills add to the possibility of 
ideal front office staff. Some of the other aspects to be kept in mind by the 
staff are a clean and neatly pressed uniform, minimum accessories and 
well groomed hair. Nails should be clean and properly manicured. The 
front office staff must be seen at their best at all times as this projects a 
good image not only of themselves but also of the establishments.

Across the country there are various catering and hospitality 
management courses offered starting from certificate to degree courses.

Hotel Management is one of the most popular choices for a carrer. 
Catering and Hospitality Management courses are offered by various 
institutes. Candiadates can pursue catering courses at undergraduates as 
well as post graduate level. Apart from degree course, one can also pursue 
diploma and certificate course in this field.

Introduction
All of us purchase a variety of goods and services to satisfy our needs and 
desires. Hence, every human is a natural consumer. Have you, your parents 
or friend experienced any problem where, even after paying for the goods, 
you found that the quality was not as per your expectations for the price 
paid or the quantity supplied was less than what was promised? Did you 
pay for some services which appeared attractive in the advertisement but 
in reality fell far short of the image portrayed? Under such circumstances 
what was your reaction? Did you feel frustrated and cheated? What did you 

222
do? Did you take any action, draw attention of the manufacturer/service 

Reprint 2025-26



provider to the problem you experienced? Did they give you a hearing and 
take any kind of corrective measures? Were you satisfied? If not, did you 
feel that the situation could have been better if you had some support? Let 
us try to find answers to these questions.

You have already learnt in Class XI about family finance management 
incorporating money income, its management, savings and investment, 
credit and also realised how important it is to get maximum satisfaction 
on spending each penny that you earn. Consumer education teaches you 
to be an efficient and alert consumer. 

Significance of Consumer Education 
and Protection
Look around and you will find that the number of products being 
manufactured and sold is steadily increasing in both urban and rural 
markets. We are all aware that manufacturers are responsible for supplying 
good quality products and if there is a problem, consumers have the right 
to redressal. Manufacturers can no longer take consumers/customers for 
granted. With increasing number of consumers and volume of consumption 
of goods and services, manufacturers/suppliers/service providers have 
begun to realise that it is important to respect and satisfy the ‘consumer’, 
since the reputation of the company and its profits are determined by 
consumer opinion. India has been transforming from an underdeveloped to 
a developing economy. Much of this can be attributed to industrialisation 
and globalisation. These economic changes have improved the standard of 
living along with increased buying power. We are living in a ‘global village’ 
and facing the challenges of global markets. The march towards ‘global 
economy’ necessitates a global outlook on the part of consumers who 
cannot sit back and watch. They have to emerge as a progressive force to 
ensure their welfare. They have to understand the economic system and 
inter relationships of individuals with each other, with business and with 
government. It is necessary for today’s consumer to be careful, alert and 
be well informed. Consumer education and protection have thus become 
important.

Further, the Indian government has become liberal and opened the 
doors to foreign companies. Thus we can see a variety of products, made 
by multinationals that have established their manufacturing/assembly 
units in India or imported items, on the shelves of many stores. This 
has advantages but, at the same time, there are disadvantages. On the 
positive side the Indian consumer has much to choose from and can look 

223

Reprint 2025-26

Unit V - Resource Management



for better products with competitive pricing. The disadvantage of having 
a large array of products is that choosing the right product is now more 
difficult since one has to understand new technology, new products and 
new features. One has to compare the price and quality, in order to be 
able to make an informed decision, especially because consumers face 
problems such as malpractices, exploitation by unscrupulous sellers, 
misleading advertisements, making it important for each one of us to be 
wise consumers.

Basic Concepts
Let us first briefly examine the word ‘consumer’. We can define Consumers 
as the final buyers of goods and services, for the satisfaction of their 
personal needs and wants, ranging from products of nature to products 
and/or services from the market. Consumers are the primary component 
of a socio-economic system since every human being who is a consumer 
to a smaller to larger extent would like to have a good standard of living. 
Hence as purchasing power increases, people tend to purchase products 
that will give comfort, satisfaction and as a symbol of prestige, contributing 
to increasing number of ‘consumer footfalls’. The more people buy, 
more money comes into the market/system and thus contributes to the 
development and growth of the country’s economy. 

Let us acquaint ourselves with a few other relevant terms:

Consumer product: The term means any article, produced or distributed 
for sale to a consumer for personal or family use in one’s home or in 
an institution e.g., school, hospital, college, office, etc., or for business 
purposes. 

Consumer behaviour: It is a process through which the buyer makes 
decisions about purchasing.

Consumer forum: A place/organisation where consumers can discuss 
consumer products/services and their advantages and disadvantages. 
Some forums work as advocacy groups that seek to protect consumers 
and help them address problems faced vis-a-vis consumer products.

Consumer footfalls: This means the number of customers/consumers 
who visit any given space such as a store or a mall. Thus with increasing 
consumption in a country, consumer footfalls are higher. Fig. 20.1 
summarises what a customer expects when s/he buys either a product or 
service.

Fig. 20.1: Consumers’ expectations while purchasing goods

However, many a times consumers face problems because the 
manufacturers/service providers may be unable to fulfill all expectations, 
some of them may cheat and many consumers do not take manufacturers/ 
retailers to task for shoddy products, high prices, adulteration, faulty 
weights and measures and/or are unaware of various protection measures. 
It is important to know about these problems so that one can ensure that 
one is not cheated. It is universally recognised that the level of consumer 
awareness and protection is an indicator of a country’s development 
and progress. Let us now look at some of the major problems faced by 
consumers.

1.  Substandard/poor quality goods: Various manufacturers can make 
the same product such as large multinational corporations, local 
Indian manufacturers and some may be imported from other 
countries. However, the material used may be different and the 
product quality may also vary, making it difficult for a consumer to 
identify a poor quality product. Many consumers are ignorant about 
quality standards.

2.  Adulteration: Adulteration may be intentional or unintentional. A 
substance is said to be adulterated when some substances are either 
added to or removed from a product. Consequently the composition, 
nature or quality is altered. Adulteration is a serious problem not 
only because it is exploitative but because it can cause harm to 
health and safety of the consumer. 225

Reprint 2025-26

Unit V - Resource Management



3.  High Prices: Every consumer expects that s/he will be charged a 
fair price for a product. However, we must bear in mind that prices 
are influenced by government policy, availability, quality, delivery 
system, market location, method of distribution, costs of promotion, 
method of purchase and consumer’s desire for convenience. Despite 
this, some consumers tend to relate price to quality of an item, 
though it is not necessary. Prices of same quality goods may 
vary because of high/low cost of production, overhead expenses, 
advertising etc. Some suppliers may overcharge when they find that 
the customer is not well informed and lacks knowledge.

4.  Lack of Consumer Information: Most consumers are unaware of their 
rights and responsibilities and do not know the various legislative 
provisions that have been made to protect them. 

5.  Inadequate or Erroneous Information given by Manufacturer: This 
includes:

zz Labels of most products are not factually correct, some are 
deceptive and misleading. Most labels fail to give complete 
essential information and often use terminologies which a 
common consumer is unable to understand. 

zz Advertisements are not informative and are limited in their ability 
to answer many essential questions about qualities or uses of 
the product. Seldom advertisements do focus on features, care 
and maintenance, after sales service, etc. 

zz There is a lack of buying guides on consumer durables and non-
durables to aid the consumer in decision-making. 

zz Packaging is being used as a potent marketing tool. Attractive 
packages persuade consumers to make impulsive purchases. 
At times the container used for packing products is larger than 
the contents. Many a times several layers of expensive packing 
material is used. Manufacturers repackage existing products 
into attractive looking and novel shapes of packs and advertise 
the product to be “in a new pack”, although the product quality is 
the same. However, the consumer is enticed by the new packing. 

6.  Incorrect Weights and Measures: The consumer sometimes ends up 
getting less quantity than what he pays for due to incorrect weights 
and measures. This is because either the weights and scales are 
altered by the retailers or correct measures are incorrectly used. 
Measures are often deceptive and exploit consumers of their money. 
Weights and measures without seal or verification stamp are not 
genuine.

7.  Spurious /Duplicate/ Imitation Products: Consumers are confused 
and cheated by spurious and substandard products, duplicates of 
well known brands, some having similar packaging, colour scheme 
and similar sounding brand names. Often such imitations are of 
poor quality and may be injurious and unsafe to use. 

8.  Sales Promotion Schemes to Entice the Consumer: Indian market is 
flooded with a plethora of products. Companies, national as well 
as multinational, are competing with one another to capture larger 
market share. To do so, they come out with several sales promotion 
schemes like exchange offers, bonus, lucky draws etc. Such means 
of sales promotion are not always genuine and deceive the consumer. 
Consumers tend to get swayed by these enticing sales promotion 
gimmicks and fall prey to them.

9.  Consumer Problems with regards to services:  Consumers face 
problems not only with regards to consumption of products of daily 
use but they also face grievances when they use a wide variety of 
services. This includes services provided by public utilities such 
as MCD, water, electricity, banks, Insurance and other financial 
institutions. There are poor after sales services provided to the 
consumers. The provider of the services do not deliver what they 
promise under the sales contract.

Activity 1

Interview five people in your locality and find out the consumer 
problems faced by them. Find out what actions they took to solve 
those problems. Make a list of problems faced and actions taken, 
and discuss in the class.

Eco-friendly Production and Green Consumption Sustainability is 
the buzz word these days. It is essentially related to the production and 
consumption system. Green marketing provides consumers with products 
that are more in tune with nature, which creates less waste products, uses 
few raw materials and saves other resources.

In order to effectively deal with the onslaught of clever and deceptive 
market interests, marketing strategies and other problems, consumers 
need to be aware and educated about their rights, responsibilities and 
protection mechanisms. Consumer Education and Protection are thus 
tools which empower and equip consumers to protect themselves from 
adverse market forces. In addition, they help the consumers understand 
legislation and policy matters which would directly have a bearing on their 

227
rights and choices as consumers.

The Government of India 
has accepted, established and 
enshrined six consumer rights 
under the Consumer Protection 
Act (CPA)1986. There are four 
basic rights— (i) right to safety, 
(ii) right to be informed, (iii) right 
to choose and (iv) right to be 
heard. Two additional rights are- 
right to redressal and right to 
education. Fig. 20.2: Consumer Protection

The Consumer Protection Act is a landmark legislation in the interest 
of the consumer. The main function of this Act is to protect consumers 
from fraudulent trade practices prevalent in the market place and provide 
redressal to them for their grievances. It is based on the principle of self 
help and protects consumer against all kinds of exploitation and unfair 
dealing. It intends to provide simple, speedy and inexpensive redressal 
to consumers for their grievances. The Act has two implications: First, 
it gives the consumer the right to complain to an authority about his/
her grievances and seek speedy redressal. Secondly, consumer can 
claim compensation for any loss or injury suffered on account of the 
negligence of the manufacturer. It applies to all goods and services unless 
otherwise expressly notified by the central government. The Act has made 
the consumer movement powerful, broad based, effective and people 
oriented.

The Consumer Protection Act (CPA) 2019 has recently replaced the three 
decade old CPA 1986. The new act proposed some measures and tightens 
the existing rules to further safeguard consumer rights. Introduction of 
a central regulator, strict penalties for misleading advertisements and 
guidelines for e-commerce and electronic service providers are some of the 
key highlights. Students can take detailed information on the revised CPA 
from the website. 

Consumer rights are those rights, which are or should be provided legally 
to protect consumer interests. In other words, these are rights designed 
to ensure that all consumers obtain goods and services of reasonable 
quality, at fair prices. Let us briefly examine what the six rights under the 
Consumer Protection Act cover:

1. Right to Safety: This refers to the right to be protected against 
hazardous effect that may be caused to the health/life of a consumer. 
This right specifies that the consumer has the right to be protected 
against products, production processes and services which are 

228 hazardous to health or life. 

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



2. Right to be Informed: This means the right to be informed about the 
quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of goods and 
services, so as to protect the consumers against unfair trade practices. 

3. Right to Choose: This implies that every buyer has the right to have 
access to products of varying quality and quantities, prices, size and 
design, at competitive prices, and to choose according to his needs 
and wants. 

4. Right to be heard: The right to be heard means that consumers’ 
interests will receive due consideration at appropriate forums. It also 
includes the right to be represented in various forums that are working 
to ensure consumer welfare. To enable consumers to exercise this 
right, both the state and voluntary agencies are expected to provide 
such forums. 

5. Right to seek redressal: Every consumer has the right to seek redressal 
against unfair trade practices or unscrupulous exploitation. It also 
includes the right to fair settlement of genuine grievances. It involves 
the right to receive compensation for faulty goods and services. 

6. Right to Consumer Education: This refers to every person’s right to 
acquire knowledge and skill to be an informed consumer, so that s/he 
will be able to make wise decisions while purchasing goods and hiring 
services. This right implies that the consumer should be educated 
enough to be able to solve the problem himself. 

Activity 2

Divide the class into two groups. Group A will deal with consumer 
rights and Group B with consumer responsibilities.

Group A: Talk to three people in your locality and find out the extent 
of their knowledge about consumer rights. 

Group B: Talk to three people in your locality and find out awareness 
about consumer responsibilities among them. 

Discuss your findings in the class and suggest what can be done to 
increase awareness about consumer rights.

Another mechanism of consumer protection is through standardisation 
marks. Consumers must purchase products with standardisation mark to 
ensure the quality/purity of the product. It is important for the consumer 
to know about different standard marks and the products covered under 
them. Standardisation is a prime requisite for attaining quality. Let us 

229
learn more about these standard marks.

Unit V - Resource Management



ISI Mark: This is the certification mark of Bureau 
of Indian Standards (BIS), earlier called the Indian 
Standards Institution (ISI). Under this scheme, licences 
are issued to manufacturers whose goods meet the 
relevant standards. Indian standards cover food items 
such as vegetables, fruits and meat products, spices 
and condiments, processed foods, cereal and soya 

Fig. 20.3: ISI mark
products, candies and beverages etc. Other products 
covered by with the BIS standards include electrical goods, soaps, 
detergents, paints, paper etc. Among the various items covered under the 
scheme, some are under mandatory certification. 

AGMARK and fruit Product Order (FPO): These standards have been 
promulgated by the Government of India. These certificates specifically 
pertain to food products. A consumer should look for AGMARK seal before 
purchasing any agricultural product as it ensures product reliability. FPO 
lays down statuary minimum standards in respect of quality of various 
fruits and vegetable products, and processing facilities. FPO also lays limits 
on metallic contaminants and preservatives for different fruit products. 

        
FPO mark Agmark Silk mark Woolmark

Fig. 20.4: Standardisation marks

Wool-mark: Wool-mark is the standard mark of quality of the International 
Wool Secretariat for wool or woolen garments. It indicates that the 
wool is pure and the marked garment is not made of other fibers but only 
pure wool. 

The Silk Mark: is a quality assurance label for the assurance of pure silk 
and in addition serves as a brand for generic promotion of pure silk. Silk 
Mark ensures ‘100% natural silk’. 

Hallmark: It indicates that the precious metals 
such as platinum, silver and gold articles have 
been evaluated and tested at an official Assaying 
and Hallmarking Centre and they have certified 
that the metal used conforms to the national/
international standard of fineness/purity. Fig. 20.5: BSI Hallmark

Ecomark Scheme: BIS operates the Ecomark scheme for labeling of

packaging material, plastic products, etc. The logo for Ecomark scheme

is an earthern pot which signifies that this product 
is environment friendly and does not produce any 
hazardous waste, is biodegradable and can be 
recycled.

FSSAI: The Food Safety and Standards Authority 
of India (FSSAI) has been established under Food 
Safety and Standards Act 2006. This lays down 
science based standards for articles of food and to 
regulate their manufacture, storage, distribution Fig. 20.7: FSSAI mark

and sale to ensure the availability of same for human consumption. 

 Apart from statutory, semi-government and non-government bodies 
looking after consumer interests like Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and 
Directorate of Marketing and Inspection (DMI), Government of India, there 
are Protection Councils set up by the government at central and state levels. 

Non-governmental organisations (NGO’s)/voluntary consumer 
organisations play an important role in consumer education and protection 
due to their non-partisan interests. They also disseminate information 
through their magazines, booklets, newsletters, buying guides, audio visual 
material and research reports. Many consumer organisations are engaged 
in comparative testing of products, creating consumer awareness about 
harmful and unsafe products, product recalls, disseminating information 
about new legislative provisions for consumers, legal advice and advocacy, 
handling consumer grievances and complaints and acting as vigilance 
groups. They hold public meetings and have libraries and documentation 
centres, and play an important role in consumer awareness, empowerment 
and consumer movement. In India we have several consumer organisations 
bringing out publications in the interest of the consumer. VOICE, a Delhi 
based consumer organisation, brings out ’Consumer Voice’, CERC, an 
Ahmedabad based consumer organisation, brings out ‘Insight’. Similarly, 
the Consumers Union in the US brings out ‘Consumer Reports’; Consumer 
Association in UK brings out ‘Which’ and the Australian Consumers 
Association brings out ‘Choice’. 

Every human being has not only rights but also responsibilities. You 
may have heard some people speak of ‘rights and responsibilities’, clearly 
indicating that both go hand in hand. Thus in order to be able to exercise 
one’s right it is necessary to be aware of one’s duty. As consumers therefore, 
we need to be aware of our responsibilities. Consumer responsibilities are:

1. Consumers should have responsibility towards regularly updating 
their knowledge of various laws and legislative provisions made by 
the government.

2. Consumers should be honest in all their dealings and must pay for 231
all their purchases. 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit V - Resource Management



3. Before making a purchase, consumers should do a market survey 
to find out the different brands, features etc. of items available in 
different shops and different markets and should compare the prices. 
This will help them make a wise choice. 

4. Consumers should feel free to choose from the variety available as 
per their needs and requirements. 

5. While making a purchase, s/he should read all the information given 
on the label/ brochure. 

6. To be assured of quality he should buy products with standardisation 
marks.

7. Consumer should keep receipts and other relevant documents 
of purchase. These may be needed as proof of purchase for filing 
complaints in case of problems/defective/malfunctioning products.

8. In case of purchase of services like insurance, credit cards, bank 
deposits etc., s/he should read and understand all terms and 
conditions, liabilities, service charges etc. and make an effort to get 
the representative to clarify points that are not clearly written.

9. S/he must have increasing awareness about various national and 
international consumer organisations in terms of their activities, 
work and understand the benefits of becoming a member of such 
organisations.

Instructions for the teachers

A leaflet may consist of a single sheet of paper that is printed on both 
sides and folded in various ways. The most common types of single-sheet 
leaflets are the bi-fold (a single sheet printed on both sides and folded 
into halves) and the tri-fold (the same, but folded into thirds). A bi-fold 
brochure results in four panels (two panels on each side), while a tri-fold 
results in six panels (three panels on each side). Important points to be 
kept in mind while designing a leaflet:

zz Heading: The leaflet heading is normally the most important part of 
the leaflet because it is the part that first catches the eye. The heading 
must be brief, summarising the theme by using short, forceful words.

zz Subheading: Leaflet subheadings are used when it is impossible to 
summarise the text in the main heading and further explanation is 
needed. They may also be used to introduce separate paragraphs in 
the body of the text and to bridge gaps between headline and text.

zz Text: To gain the interest of a target audience within the first few words, 
the first or two sentences of the text should contain the substance 
of the message, with the facts and details following. The text should 
be simple and to the point, presenting the message to the target 
audience without confusing them. The leaflet normally presents only 
one theme. A leaflet which presents two or more unrelated or vaguely 
related themes confuses the target audience.

zz Pictures: When pictures, preferably photographs, are used, the picture 
and the text must complement each other, convey the same idea to 
the target audience, each expanding the ideas of the other.

The leaflet/pamphlet for Consumer Education can be on any one of the 
following topics:

a. Consumer Protection Act

b. Consumer Rights

c. Consumer responsibilities

d. Standardisation marks

e. Consumer problems/redressal

COMMUNICATION AND

Unit VI - Communication and Extension



Introduction
In India, there is a concerted effort to reach higher levels of development 
and to ensure that benefits of development reach all, including the vast 
rural population. Today’s ‘information society’ needs to tackle this crucial 
challenge by using the discipline of Communication and Extension to create 
awareness, sensitise, educate and empower the masses. Communication 
and Extension Education are crucial ingredients in the country’s endeavours 
to respond to the needs of families and communities for promoting their 
development. 

This discipline provides a core curriculum that integrates theory and 
practice in planning development programmes, media and communication. 
It allows students to analyse development programmes, policies and the 
role of mass media and journalism in the process of development. In 
recent years, national and international donors and development agencies 
have increasingly worked to share information about their policies and 
activities through their websites, publications, videos and other interactive 
multi-media. Non-governmental organisations have become more 
sophisticated in using a variety of media and communication strategies. 
With globalisation, the need to understand international development 
issues has increased. In order to sensitise society about the needs of the 
disadvantaged, use of advocacy is gaining popularity. Advocacy means to 
be an advocate for a cause. It is not used here in terms of legal provisions 
but largely to support a cause. The causes may be like preventing early 
marriage of girls, enhancing educational opportunities for children in 
rural and tribal areas or for preventing deforestation. Advocacy involves 
lobbying with governments and multilateral bodies to build alliances and 
networks, and to inform supporters. 

Consequently there is an increasing demand for staff with skills in 
media and therefore offers a range of career avenues for graduates of this 
programme. Specialising in Communication and Development will prepare 
students to work in the communication and information departments of 
national and international development agencies, extension and advisory 
services in the public, commercial and not-for-profit sectors. Besides 
this, a person may choose to have an independent career in development 
communication. 

In the year 2015, world leaders had set seventeen broad time-
bound development goals. These are commonly known as Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are global but are adapted by each 
country to suit specific local, development needs. They provide a framework 
for the entire international community to work together towards a common 

242 end — ensuring that human development reaches everyone, everywhere. 

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



Today, with the perspectives of the Sustainable Development Goals, 
extension programmes are planned to address the challenges India is 
facing such as poverty alleviation, enhancing food security, improvement of 
health and sanitation, non formal education, environmental conservation 
and gender equity and these continue to be the major goals of extension 
programmes. Extension educators are required to extend critical 
information, transfer new technologies and build skills and capacities 
of different stakeholders working in Development Programmes, with 
Non-Governmental Organisations, education and research institutes 
and as entrepreneurs. Over time, extension programmes have changed 
and evolved new methodologies and strategies to meet the challenges of 
enabling behaviour change of people to adopt healthy practices.

Various organisations like government ministry/department, 
international agencies, non-governmental organisations, voluntary 
agencies or even corporate bodies involved in corporate social responsibility 
activities require persons who can provide direct technical assistance 
and support for devising appropriate Social and Behaviour Change 
Communication (SBCC) strategies, interventions, tools and training to 
support programmes of health, nutrition, education, HIV/AIDS, natural 
resource management and social development. 

Communication and Extension which is one of the domains of HEFS, 
is taught in numerous colleges and universities across the country. In 
different institutions, different names may be used for this domain, 
such as Education Extension or Extension Education, Extension and 
Development Communication, Home-Science and Communication 
Management, Development Communication and Extension, Extension 
and Communication. While the core of the subject remains same, the 
emphasis and coverage determine the nomenclature.

Introduction
Communication is an integral part of our social and professional life. 
On television, radio and newspapers, you must have seen, heard or read 
about the issues related to health, environment, consumption, poverty 
and other topics, besides news. Have you ever wondered who writes about 
such issues? Have you also sensed that mass media wield the power to 
investigate and question what is happening, where and why? These issues 
point to a special concern in our society regarding the role played by media 
in journalism. Development Journalism is a social activity and through 
various media, the journalist communicates feelings of the community 
to the community. The importance of journalism comes from the people’s 

Reprint 2025-26



right to opinion and expression since right to opinion and expression 
would not be a reality without the various forms of media including social 
media. People today depend greatly on the media for being informed. 
Journalism is taken as an inseparable part of any democratic system. The 
Press plays a vital role in democratic society. People’s participation is the 
foundation of democracy. Press is called the fourth pillar of democracy. 
The theory and practice of development communication and journalism 
continues to evolve and has become indispensable part of our lives today. 
It is characterised by conceptual flexibility.

Significance 
How does communication help in working towards development? It creates 
awareness about available technologies and mobilises people to use them for 
the betterment of society. It links Government agencies, NGOs and people. 
Development communication and Development Journalism are important 
fields of study that sensitise students to the process of development and 
train them to write and/or speak about issues related to equitable and 
impartial society. Development Communication and Journalism aim at 
equipping students, current and prospective journalists, campaigners 
and media professionals to deepen their knowledge and practical skills on 
development issues. 

Basic Concepts 

Development means positive changes in the socio-economic and cultural 
lives of the majority of people on a permanent basis without exploitation or 
violence. Development in most parts of the world calls for intensive efforts 
to tackle the problems of mass illiteracy, population, malnutrition, poor 
health, hunger and pollution, etc.

Development Journalism is a relatively newer concept. It has come 
into existence after the colonial era ended. Prior to independence, reporting 
used to be done about issues like struggles, fights, assassinations, 
disasters, wars and whatever the colonial rulers chose to communicate. 
The newly liberated countries like India were undergoing a lot of expansion 
in development activities. The newsmen and journalists had to take notice 
of these activities. Now, development journalism focusses on success 
stories of people who have adopted new technologies, tried new methods 
and helped the society. It seeks to describe the people at work in new 
projects and processes.

Development Communication is utilising the power of communication 245
as a catalyst for social development. It is the practice of systematically 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit VI - Communication and Extension



applying the processes, strategies, and principles of communication to bring 
about positive social change. The term “Development Communication” was 
first coined in 1972 by Nora Quebral. It is the ‘art and science of human 
communication’ used for facilitating development of a disadvantaged 
society in a planned manner to ensure equity and achievement of individual 
potential. 

Development communication has the following essential features:

zz It is oriented to socio-economic development and happiness of the 
people and community at large.

zz It aims at giving information and educating the community.

zz It combines suitable mass media and interpersonal communication 
channels for greater impact. 

zz It is based on the audience characteristics and their environment.

Development communication is a two way process of communication 
between those who have information and those who are ignorant. It 
assumes that people who face the problem have the innate ability to find 
solutions. They may need help or assistance in seeking resources. It views 
motivation as the key element. It tries to build dialogue between people 
and development agencies. Therefore, it is a social process designed to 
seek a common understanding or consensus among all the participants in 
development leading to concerted action.

Now you will read about some of the outstanding examples of 
Development Communication initiatives in India. Similar initiatives have 
been carried out in other parts of the world too, especially in developing 
countries like Brazil, Peru, Indonesia, Bangladesh and many others. This 
will help you not only to understand how the development communication 
efforts use technologies and means of mass communication but also 
employ them chiefly for development purposes involving local people and 
find sustainable solutions for the future. This will also give you an idea 
about the future scope of this area and what kinds of job opportunities are 
available to the students interested in this field. 

We will learn about Journalism, Campaigns on Radio/Television/Print 
media/Video as means of Development Communication in order to enable 
you to appreciate and be informed about similar attempts on other mass 
media channels for prevention of smoking, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and 
for promotion of sanitation literacy, immunisation, safe child birth and 
consumer awareness through campaigns like ‘Jago Grahak Jago’.

between all the participants or stakeholders aimed at breaking silence

RRE was a nationwide communication campaign for generating 
awareness about HIV/AIDS. A specially designed train traversed 
over 9,000 km a year, covering 180 districts/halt stations, and held 
programmes and activities in 43,200 villages. It comprised of seven 
coaches, equipped with educational material, primarily on HIV/
AIDS, interactive touch screens and 3-D models, services in the 
context of HIV-TB co-infection, an LCD projector and platform for 
folk performances, counselling cabins and two doctors’ cabins for 
providing counselling and treatment.

RRE started its journey from Kanyakumari, followed the ‘parikrama’ 
style and halted at 180 stations and covered almost all the states of 
India. During the halt at each station the performing artists divided 
themselves into different groups. Each group had orators and 
performers who went to different villages to undertake Information 
Education Communication (IEC) activities such as street plays, folk 
songs, stories and group counselling sessions. Locally mobilised 
youth groups joined the team from the trains.

The Project was implemented by National AIDS Control Organisation 
(NACO), Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS) and International 
Agencies such as UNICEF and UNAIDS, is cooperation with Indian 
Railways.

It aimed to:

zz Spread information regarding primary prevention services
zz Develop an understanding of the disease, to reduce stigma and 

discrimination against people with AIDS
zz Enhance people’s knowledge about preventive measures, health 

habits and lifestyle.

Many methods are used in this field. In this unit, let us review some 
selected methods.

1. Campaign is a combination of the usage of different communication 
methods and materials such as meetings, tours, newspaper articles, leaflets 
and exhibitions about a theme for a predefined period of time. It is a well 
organised and intensive activity. A campaign creates public awareness and 
provides specific message. Use of dramatics through different channels 
ensures attention and interest. It lasts in the memory of the people 
and stimulates action. It creates conducive environment for adoption 
of practices. For example, to accelerate the efforts to achieve universal 
sanitation coverage and to put focus on sanitation, the Prime Minister of 
India had launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on 2nd October 2014. The 
mission was implemented as a nation wide campaign/Janandolan which 
aimed at eliminating open defecation in rural areas during the period 2014 
to 2019 through mass scale behaviour change, construction of household-
owned and community-owned toilets and establishing mechanisms for 
monitoring toilet construction and usage.

2. Radio and Television are the most popular, cheapest and convenient 
mass media that can be used for development purposes. The field of 
broadcast journalism has distinct advantage over print media, as it can 
be used to reach out to more people, particularly those with poor literacy 
levels. It also has an advantage over television as it is available at a 
comparatively lower cost. Radio is the most accessible mass medium. It is 
a mobile medium i.e. it can move with the listener at work or rest. 

Radio programmes are presented in the form of news, interviews, 
discussions, documentaries, drama, quiz etc. News cover many different 
topics in a short time. Interesting facts and stories of current human 
interest are broadcast at regular intervals. Public Service Announcement 
(PSA) is a brief 10–60 second message between programs, generally in the 
form of jingles. They provide information or suggestions for action. These 
are basically advertisement of some idea or a message for public good like 
‘obey traffic rules’ or ‘say no to tobacco’ and more. These are generally 
found to be quite effective because of their catchy slogan(s) and repeated 
broadcasts.

The earlier limitation of radios (of not receiving feedback) is overcome 
with the newer interactive format and local radio stations and community 
radio which has been successfully used as a people’s medium. Owing to the 
popularity of radio as a medium of communication, Ministry of Information 
and Broadcasting has introduced a new concept of ‘local radio station’ 
called Community Radio (CR) where the local people have an important 
role to play. With a small investment, and training of few local people by 
NGOs working for capacity building to support CRS, a radio station can be 
set up with broadcasting possible in a limited area. It is run and managed 
by local people and the contents are for local use in their local dialect. The 
local radio station generally supports local programmes of development. It 
gives opportunity to people to participate and express their views and also 
display their talents. Radio thus becomes the voice of the people, a catalyst 
for people’s development, and encourages youth to prepare for a career in 
DCJ (Development Communication Journalism).

information on developmental aspects. Participation of local community 
is encouraged. This powerful media is also used as information dispenser 
about government policies, entitlements, programmes, schemes and 249
services. There have been some successful attempts in using community

radio in different parts of the country. Some examples are Community 
radio being operated in Vanasthali Vidyapeeth (Rajasthan), Self Employed 
Women’s Association (SEWA) (Gujarat), Delhi University (DU) FM in North 
Delhi and many such others that are helping communities in voicing their 
problems and finding solutions.

In September 2004, India launched Education Satellite (EDUSAT) 
which was the first Indian satellite built exclusively to serve the educational 
sector. EDUSAT is used to meet the demand for an interactive satellite-
based distance education system in India.

Television today offers a variety of programmes through several 
channels, international, national and local levels. Some of the programmes 
have scope for people to participate in the form of talk shows, reality shows, 
competitions, etc. Other programmes of immense educational value like 
‘Kyunki Jeena isi Ka Nam hai’ and ‘Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hun’ can 
be viewed on private channels. These indicate the scope of education and 
entertainment to be harnessed together for common good.

Activity 3

Prepare an exhaustive list of programmes/jingles on different national 
and local channels which try to generate awareness among masses 
on issues related to Health, Sanitation, Food, Literacy, Environment, 
Pollution, Energy conservation or any kind of donations. Additionally, 
encourage students to plan and conduct a quiz. 

3. Print media The bulk of news appearing in the national and regional 
dailies is urban in its approach. In general, reports on agriculture, problems 
of rural areas, and other development concerns remain low in priority. 
Newspapers and periodicals operating in rural areas, covering local themes 
are few. Still the power of press cannot be denied. Though limited to a very 
few good examples, it is a medium of continuous education.

Given below is an example of an experiment ‘Project Village Chhatera’, 
which is considered a success story.

The Project Village Chhatera was started in 1969 and focussed 
its attention on a small village Chatera in Northwest Delhi. The 
Hindustan Times started a regular fortnightly column describing 
the lives of the people. A team of enterprising reporters wrote with 
sensitivity giving detailed stories of the situation in the village. They 
wrote about the Village Chaupal, aspirations of people, livelihood 
issues and festivities. The problems of eletricity, water supply and 

250 deficit rainfall etc. were reported with photographs. It proved to be 
a catalyst in bringing various services and benefits. Solutions to

problems were available due to attention of the local leaders. The 
print coverage brought machines, bridges, roads and banks into 
the project area.

4. Information, and Communication 
Technologies (ICTs) is an umbrella term that includes computer hardware 
and software, digital broadcast and telecommunications technologies. 
ICTs have been used for informing people. In both poor and wealthy 
countries, mobile phone use has enabled and facilitated the expansion of 
markets, social business and public services. An entire range of economic 
services, enabled by mobile phones, have enabled banking and financial 
transactions, marketing and distribution, employment and public services. 
ICTs are proving to be economically, socially and politically transformative. 

A more direct approach to the use of ICTs aimed at bettering the 
lives of the poor is through the setting up of tele-centres. Many projects 
were started in India over the last decade or so and there is a sizeable 
research literature on the topic, some of which will be summarised here. 
For example:

zz The Sustainable Access in Rural India (SARI) project in the state 
of Tamilnadu: Some 80 tele-centre kiosks were set up offering 
a range of services including basic computer education, e-mail, 
web browsing and various e-government services including the 
provision of certificates.

zz Empowering Women at the Grassroots: SEWA and ICTs

The Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) is a union of 
several thousand poor women working in the informal sector in 
India. SEWA’s aim is to achieve full employment and self-reliance 
for women workers by focussing both on work and support in 
other related areas like income, food and social security (health, 
childcare and shelter). Having understood the effect of poor access 
to information on poverty, SEWA embarked on a journey to include 
ICTs within its work. The vision was to make ICTs a tool for 
empowering its ever-increasing numbers of grassroots members. It 
now runs programmes which develop women’s abilities in the use of 
computers, radio, television, video, telephone, fax machines, mobile 
phones and satellite communication. Community Learning Centres 
(CLCs) have been set up in rural areas, and focus on IT training to 
build the capacity of members including areas such as electrical, 
mechanical and IT engineering. Besides savings in time and cost, 
this medium enables the members of SEWA to achieve quick and 
easy communication and problem-solving across districts.

Knowledge and Skills required for a 
career in this field
Cognitive skills are required to be able to comprehend an issue. Creative 
skills are required to project the issues and concepts in a creative way to 
attract attention and make an impact. Any student with skills in media 
designing, production and technical instrument handling will have an 
advantage while undertaking assignments or jobs with media houses and 
advertising agencies. 

Technical skills — Those interested to work as a development filmmaker, 
need to know camera techniques and video production apart from content 
development and implementation. Apart from these, skill in editing comes 
handy for marketing management.

DCJ professionals need to learn the technical skills to operate 
equipment correctly to optimise their presentations. They need to learn 
laws and regulations about what they can and cannot do. Developing 
presentation techniques to deliver smooth and entertaining programs 
along with interviewing techniques are important. They need to learn about 
the computers used to operate the station, basic radio production skills 
using suitable software and how to write a creative brief that effectively

generally gains real experience at writing a radio spot and having it 
recorded and scheduled for airplay. For a career in DCJ, a combination 
of journalistic and presentation skills are required. Interest in current 
affairs and local conditions, hands-on experience in radio, the ability to 
communicate and knowledge of music are useful.

Questioning ability helps to look into the finer details of any issue. 
Passion for adventure and travel are added advantages because travel 
to the remotest parts of the country would help to gather unique and 
interesting stories. 

Ability to work with diverse groups is imperative for a development 
communication student. S/he needs to be people centric to understand 
people’s viewpoint on issues affecting their lives and find solutions which 
will work for them. For this, it is important to know the principles of social 
work. The guiding principle has to be ‘helping people help themselves’. 
Also, acquiring and practising leadership skills helps to be successful. If 
a person is keen on being a development communication specialist, the 
person should be a good listener too, to write with sensitivity. Excellent 
interpersonal skills, ability to interact professionally with staff, partners 
and consultants are the demands of present day work culture. 

Language and computer skills are very essential. Command in any one 
language is important and includes speaking, writing and reading with an 
ability to write technical reports and documents. Basic computer skills in 
using Microsoft Office applications, including Word, Excel and PowerPoint 
are desirable for success. 

Scope and Career avenues in 
Development Communication
This field employs a variety of media and communication techniques to 
address issues like information dissemination and education, behavior 
change, social marketing, media advocacy, communication for social 
change, and participatory development communication. Thus, this field has 
a wide scope in terms of content and use. Undertaking training, advisory 
and action projects that help build up the communication capabilities and 
resources of people in the development process also fall in the scope of 
study.

A development communication specialist can take up a variety of 
career paths in the social sector like media houses, government and non- 
government organisations. Since large scale projects are run by Government 
departments with the help of international agencies, employment 253

Corporate Communication 
And Public Relations

Learning Objectives
After completing this chapter, the learner will be able to— 

zz understand the meaning, significance and scope of Corporate 
Communication and Public Relations (PR)

zz comprehend functions of and skills required for corporate 
communication and public relations

zz understand areas and principles of PR activities.

Introduction
Every idea, fact or opinion is static until communicated and understood. In 
today’s information driven society it has been acknowledged time and again 
that communication is as important as food, clothing and shelter. In this 
chapter we are looking at communication as it is related to organisations 
and business establishments. Corporate communication is considered as 
an important tool of management which has evolved over the years.

Corporate communication is described as the set of activities involved 
in ‘managing and orchestrating all internal and external communications’ 
which are designed to create favourable starting points. 

Reprint 2025-26



Corporate communication is based on giving out of information by a 
variety of specialists and generalists in an organisation. It is concerned 
with people, organisational processes, activities and media.

Significance 
A major variable for the success of any organisation is the perception of 
the public. What the general public, competitors, employees “perceive” 
about the organisation is what defines its respectability, its position and 
ultimately its success. The primary objective of corporate communication 
is to establish a perception (true or otherwise) in the eyes of all its 
stakeholders. That is the significance of corporate communication; 
‘controlling how the world sees you’. For example, in a crisis, regardless of 
what actually happened, it is the public’s and employees’ understanding 
of the crisis and how it was tackled that will define their reaction to the 
organisation. If a company does not present itself as quiet, dignified and 
peaceful, and projects aggressive behaviour it will be questioned by the 
stakeholders. 

The company’s fortune is influenced by the public’s assessment of 
whether aggressive behaviour was necessary or not. The significance of 
the corporate communication team is to understand how the stakeholders 
will react to such behaviour. They have to ensure through press releases, 
newsletters, ads and other modes of communication so that public gets 
only that information which the organisation wants them to have. 

PR is a very important function or activity of any organisation. Therefore, 
it must be entrusted to effective and experienced executives. Each public 
relations programme can have different objectives, strategy and plan. For 
example, to create a positive image of a company, to handle a company 
crisis, to motivate the employees, to create curiosity about a product, to 
advertise a product and to inform about an event in advance. PR plans to 
achieve each of the above mentioned objectives with different approaches. 
Some of these are: press conferences, press releases, parties and get- 
togethers before any special event. Public Relations and advertising 
and media are inter-related and may have common characteristics and 
activities.

locally and globally. A great deal of management’s current concern for 
employee productivity and the need to empower people has revolved 
around the use of teams. But more often what is required is the simplest 
need of all — communication. This is illustrated in the following study: 

When a group of industrial engineers were asked in a 1990 study 
how to improve productivity, communication concerns drew the 
strongest response to any question on survey. More than 88 per 
cent of the engineers strongly agreed that lack of communication 
and cooperation among different components of a business leads to 
reduced productivity (“P and Q Survey” 1990).

CEOs have also recognised the importance of communication. In 
a study by A. Foster Higgins and Company, an employee-benefits 
consulting firm found that 97 per cent of the CEOs surveyed 
believe that communicating with employees positively affects job 
satisfaction. Furthermore, the survey found that 79 per cent think 
that communication benefits the bottom line; surprisingly, only 22 
per cent communicate with employees weekly or more (Farnham 
1989).

Public Relations 

Public relations (PR) is both an art and a science. It has the beauty and 
emotionality of art and the system of science. It may mean different things to 
different people. Though it is of recent origin in India and the world over, it is 
used in Government, public and private sectors and other institutions. The PR 
techniques, strategies and practices vary from organisation to organisation. 

“The fundamental way of getting public approval is to deserve it” —
Arthur W. Page

Following definitions of PR will give you some idea about its nature and 
scope.

“Establishing a bond of relationships and contacts between two groups 
of public”

“Deliberate, planned and sustained effort to establish and maintain 
mutual understanding between an organisation and the public”

“PR is an attempt, through information, persuasion, adjustment and 

258 contacts, to seek for some activity, cause, movement, institution, product 
or service”

Code of ethics is a very crucial requirement in any profession. PR 
professionals are no exception to this requirement. They have access to 
information or knowledge about events to come; pressure or temptation to 
commercialise this information must be avoided at all costs. While serving 
the interests of clients and employees, PR professionals must ensure that 
they adhere to a code of ethics and a code of conduct so that they are not 
labelled as fixers or manipulators.

Corporate communication is important primarily as it creates:

zz Positive and favourable public perception

zz Effective and efficient avenues of communication

zz Strong corporate culture, corporate identity and corporate 
philosophy

zz Genuine sense of corporate citizenship.

Functions of Corporate Communication 

Corporate communication builds a healthy organisational environment. 
In an organisation information is to be disseminated by specialists 
and generalists to a variety of people besides sharing information with 
employees, stockholders, media and customers. Corporate communication 
creates and maintains the brand and looks after the organisation’s 
reputation. It projects the company’s brand within and beyond the 
organisation. Thus, the process of corporate communication ensures a 
liaison between an organisation and outside bodies. Nowadays it is used 
as a public relations tool to project a positive corporate image, to build 
strong relationships with stockholders, to inform the public about new 
products and achievements. A smooth and affirmative relationship with 
all stakeholders helps in maintaining and sustaining a positive corporate 
image. Be it a corporate body, company, organisation, institution, non-
governmental organisation or a governmental body—all of them need 
to have a respectable image and reputation. Increasing competition, 
accessibility of information and the media explosion have made ‘reputation 
management’ a priority for most organisations. This is handled in a 
professional manner by corporate communicators. Dealing with crisis 
control, enabling sophisticated approaches to global communications, and 
comprehension and utilisation of complicated communication tools and 
technologies are also important functions of corporate communication. 259

Functions of PR

Functions performed by corporate PR Departments and PR agencies 
have many factors in common. Given below are most of the common 
functions:

1. Public Relations Policy: Develop and recommend corporate public 
relations policy and share it with top management and all departments. 
This is truer for PR agencies.

2. Statements and Press Releases: Preparation of corporate statements, 
sometimes speeches for executives and press releases are to be prepared 
by the PR personnel. In the process, they are in a position to articulate 
and project positive image of the company or product or policies.

3. Publicity: Issuing announcements of company activities and products 
to media and community. Planning promotional campaign using media 
is also a vital function. Handling inquiries from press and people at 
large is a part of the function.

4. Maintaining Relations: The PR personnel are expected to maintain 
liaisons with Government units at local, national and international 
levels. They are expected to uphold good relations with the community 
as ‘good neighbours’. This includes compliance with environment 
protection standards, giving employment opportunities to locals, and 
cooperating and participating in locality development programmes. 
Communication between company and shareholders and with other 
investors is also an important part of maintaining relations. Sometimes 
the PR agency may have to prepare annual/quarterly reports and 
planning meetings of stockholders.

5. Publications: Preparing and publishing in-house magazines is also 
sometimes the function of a PR agency.

Major Areas of PR Activity

1. Press Relations: PR persons have to maintain cordial relations with 
the press at all levels, from editor to reporter. Press and PR are both 
dependent on each other for their bread and butter. Providing well 
written and well-timed press releases, helping the correspondent to 
write their articles, easy accessibility, forbearance of press criticism, 
avoiding biases and undue favours to some papers are some of the 
features of press relations. The PR man should project the culture of 
the organisation while disseminating information about the product 
or service. Journalists need news to remain in the business, and PR 
needs publicity. Thus, there is a give and take between the two. This 

260 interdependence of PR and press should be understood.

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



2. Advertising: A product does not sell on its own merit, it needs to 
be advertised. The purpose of advertising may be to disseminate 
information, persuade or influence people to consume the product. 
There are many media for advertising like newspaper, radio, TV and 
so on. Usually, it is the PR person who decides the budget and which 
media to use for advertising.

3. Publications: Bringing out brochures, folders, pamphlets, circular-
letters, in-house-magazines and similar materials are the responsibility 
of PR department. While preparing the material simplicity, clarity, cost, 
true image of the organisation and attractiveness are the points to be 
remembered.

4. Other Media coordination: Use of other audio-visual media, films, 
exhibition, hoardings, puppetry and folk-songs come under the range 
of operations of PR department. Good public speaking and courteous 
speaking over the phone can also add to the positive image as spoken 
words are still one of the best modes of communication. They have 
to maintain good relations with other publicity media like radio and 
television.

5. PR with Constituents: Along with the local press, PR persons also have 
to have a liaison with local community, financial analysts, bankers, 
major leading institutions, share-holders and potential investors. 
Internal PR activities include maintaining relations with all employees 
including executives and other senior personnel, so the PR man gets 
all the information, keeps himself informed of all the happenings in the 
organisation. 

Seven Principles of Public Relations 

Arthur W. Page practised seven principles of public relations management 
as a means of implementing his philosophy.

zz Tell the truth. Let the public know what is happening and provide an 
accurate picture of the company’s character, ideals and practices.

zz Prove it with action. Public perception of an organisation is determined 
90 per cent by what it does and 10 per cent by what it says.

zz Listen to the customer. To serve the company well, understand what 
the public wants and needs. Keep top decision makers and other 
employees informed about public reaction to company products, 
policies and practices.

zz Manage for tomorrow. Anticipate public reaction and eliminate 
practices that create difficulties. Generate goodwill. 261

Reprint 2025-26

Unit VI - Communication and Extension



zz Conduct public relations as if the whole company depends on it. 
Corporate relations is a management function. No corporate strategy 
should be implemented without considering its impact on the public. 
The public relations professional is a policymaker capable of handling 
a wide range of corporate communications activities.

zz Realise that a company’s true character is expressed by its people. 
The strongest opinions good or bad about a company are shaped 
by the words and deeds of its employees. As a result, every 
employee active or retired is involved with public relations. It is the 
responsibility of corporate communications to support each employee’s 
capability and desire to be an honest, knowledgeable ambassador to 
customers, friends, shareowners and public officials.

zz Remain calm, patient and good-humored. Lay the groundwork for 
public relations miracles with consistent and reasoned attention 
to information and contacts. This may be difficult with today’s 
contentious 24-hour news cycles and endless number of watchdog 
organisations. But when a crisis arises, remember, cool heads 
communicate best. 

 
Two types of communication are used more in corporate communication 
— Internal and External Communication.

Internal Communication: It takes place between and among the employer 
and employees of an organisation. It is considered a vital tool for binding 
an organisation, enhancing employee morale, promoting transparency 
and reducing slow destruction. The root cause of most internal problems 
faced by a company is ineffective communication.

Internal communication flows in different directions — vertical, 
horizontal, diagonal, across the organisational structure. Internal 
communication may be formal or informal. It helps in discharge of 
managerial functions like planning, direction, coordination, motivation etc. 
The broad policies and objectives flow downward from top management to 
lower level. Both written and oral or verbal media can be used to transmit 
messages. Written media consists of instructions, orders, letters, memos, 
house journals, posters, bulletins boards, information racks, handbooks, 
manuals, activity reports.

External Communication: It takes place between members of an 
organisation and the outside world. External communication is also very 
important as it enhances and enables significant functions of creating 
positive image, brand preservation and maintaining public relations. In a 
global society, external communication helps in marketing as well.

262

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



External communication is concerning transmission of messages, 
desirable information outside the organisation with Government, its 
departments, customers, dealers, inter-corporate bodies, general public 
etc. External communication promotes goodwill with the public. Certain 
facts and information must be shared and exchanged with outsiders. Both 
written and verbal media can be used. Written media consists of letters, 
memos, in-house magazines, posters, bulletins, annual reports and so on.

Two major areas of communication activity are:

1. Composing message 

2. Transmitting message

The following 7 Cs of communication should be kept in mind while 
composing a message:

1. Conciseness: The message should be concise in nature so that 
it is easy to catch the readers’ attention.

2. Concreteness: Message should be concrete as having all the 
meanings conveyed in it but should be short in length.

3. Clarity: It must give appropriate and explicit meaning that 
would not diversify and confuse the reader at any instance.

4. Completeness: Also it is important that the message must have 
complete meaning that will provide sufficient information to its 
reader.

5. Courtesy: Another important feature is that the sender must 
emphasise on courteous tone and must give some compliments 
and benefits to its readers.

6. Correctness: The message conveyed must be checked for 
correctness and should be free from all grammatical errors.

7. Consideration: There must be proper consideration in the 
message and it should emphasise on your attitude rather than 
‘I’ and ‘we’ kind of words.

Knowledge and Skills required
Skills equip you to be a better and effective communicator. They help you 
in composing and transmitting messages successfully. Listening skills 
can be self taught; interpersonal skills, negotiation skills and rapport 
establishment skills can be learnt by observing successful and effective 
people; presentation skills involve use of software-hardware which requires 
formal training. Similarly, there are training programmes for accent 
neutralisation, public speaking, telephone etiquette, basic writing skills, 
decision making and stress management. Time management may require 
some training or many executives develop it through experience. 

1. Listening Skills: Listening is an active process involving three parts: 
hearing, understanding and response. Hearing is the physical aspect of 
your body receiving and interpreting sounds. You may hear these words 
as part of a conversation. Hearing is critical to listening, but it is only 
the first part. Understanding is where your brain processes the words 
that you hear and derives meaning from them in the context of the 
entire conversation. Information is communicated to you at this stage. 
Once you understand what you are hearing, the last part is responding. 
Responding in a conversation shows that you have heard what was 
said and that you understand the intent of the speaker. Responding 
may involve making a decision to act on the information you have 
understood and perhaps replying with your opinion or comments. 

2. Interpersonal Skills: Interpersonal skills refer to the measure of a 
person’s ability to operate within business organisations through social 
communication and interactions. These are the skills that one uses to 
interact with other people. Having positive interpersonal skills increases 
productivity in the organisation since conflicts are reduced. In informal 
situations, it allows communication to be easy and comfortable. People 
with good interpersonal skills can generally control the feelings that 
emerge in difficult situations and respond appropriately, instead of 
being distressed by emotion.

3. Negotiation Skills: Negotiation is a process in which both the 
parties have unacceptable points regarding an issue or deal. Through 
negotiation, each party tries to convince the other. There will be usually 
more issues and variables than could be used for such a trading; both 
the sides must be fully prepared. Through good negotiation it is possible 
for both the sides to come out of a deal happy. Each of the negotiators 
will, if done properly, be concerned with trading concessions against 
each other. Good negotiator should consider all the possible variables 
before meeting, calculate or do estimate what each will cost, then decide 

264

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



which he/she will prefer to use and which others would be prepared to 
use if it came to a crunch. 

4. Presentation Skills: These are used for communicating ideas and 
information to a group. A presentation carries the speaker’s personality 
better and allows immediate interaction between all the participants. 
A good presentation has: content, structure, packaging and human 
element. Content contains information that people need. The information 
must be as much as the audience can absorb in one sitting. Structure 
has a logical beginning, middle, and end. It must be sequenced and 
paced so that the audience can understand it. The presenter must 
be careful to hold the attention of the audience. Packaging refers to 
the treatment given to content. There is scope to use technologies like 
software, PPT with use of software.

5. Human Element: A good presentation will be remembered because 
it has a person attached to it. You still need to analyse the audience’s 
needs and select an approach. For example, in many offices cards are 
sent on employee’s birthdays or special occassions. Along with the card 
if the superior wishes him/her personally, it always makes one feel 
better. 

6. Rapport Establishment: “Rapport is the establishment of trust 
and harmony in a relationship. It is the key element in the art of 
obtaining the support and co-operation of other people. Around 93% 
of communication is transmitted by your body language and the way 
that you speak (analogue communication). Only 7% of the message is 
carried by the words (digital communication). Most of the time your 
analogue communication is unconscious. By developing an ability to 
work at both the conscious and unconscious levels of communication, 
you will learn how to establish deeper rapport and build trust and 
harmony - with virtually anyone, in a much shorter time frame. Most 
of us are able to establish rapport with certain types of people but a 
master communicator has the ability to establish rapport with a wider 
range of people.” 

7. Effective Decision Making: Decision making can be a complex 
process; all the same, every successful person must have this skill. 
There are human and material elements involved in decision making. 
One has to assess or prioritise all these factors, anticipate the outcome 
and take decisions in the best interest of all parties concerned. For 
example, as students you get a certain amount of pocket money. There 
are always many options like food, movies, gifts for friends/family 
members, Xeroxing study material and so on. How you spend it to 
make yourself happy and take care of your needs will depend on your 
decision making skill. You also have a few hours per week to pursue 265

Reprint 2025-26

Unit VI - Communication and Extension



your hobbies and other pastimes. Your ability to decide the order of 
importance of activities will guide the decision about activity selection. 
In corporate houses managers have the challenge of effective decision 
making because they are faced with situations of balancing between 
efficiency, profit, satisfaction of stakeholders, employees and owners.

8. Telephone Etiquette, Basic Writing Skills (Writing Email and Notes, 
etc.), Public Speaking Skills: You must have been exposed to these 
three skills and by now must have acquired reasonably good proficiency. 
Telephone etiquettes create good impression and puts the other person 
at ease. Basic writing skills are part of your English Curricula. Many of 
you must have participated in elocution competitions, won prizes and 
heard speeches of good orators, lecturers. As a corporate communicator 
you have to develop and apply them for success in your business.

9. Accent Neutralisation: A language is spoken with an accent 
according to the cultural bearing. We all have experienced the different 
English accent of Indians and also from the British, Americans, and 
Australians and so on. There is a difference in the accent of all. In 
accent neutralisation one pronounces the words in such a way that 
the listener is able to understand what is being spoken. There are 
many other reasons such as: to increase personal and professional 
opportunities, improve professional image of your company, engaging 
in extensive conversations, presentations, and telephone calls, be 
more confident and effective, both socially and professionally, greater 
understanding from listeners. 

10. Time Management: Time is a matchless and valuable resource that 
you need in order to do your work, accomplish your goals, spend 
time with your loved ones, and enjoy everything that life has to offer. 
Utilising time to achieve your goals is a skill that can be developed if 
you don’t have it. There are ways to learn or improve this skill. Time 
management is a set of principles, practices, skills, tools, and systems 
working together to help you get more value out of your time with 
the aim of improving the quality of life. It leads to the development 
of processes and tools that increase efficiency and productivity. Time 
management enables each of us to improve and be more productive 
and to be fulfilled individually, so logically the effects across whole 
organisations of good or poor time management are enormous. Time 
management leads to less stress.

11. Stress Management: Although most of us experience some kind of 
stress on a daily basis (even if it’s only from something like reaching 
school on time, preparing for test, deciding how to look attractive for a 
special occasion), few may actually know what stress actually is. What 

266

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 2



is Stress? A situation that causes pressure or strain is stress. Stress is 
our physical, mental, and emotional response to the various demands, 
changes, and events in our life. In some cases, stress motivates and 
encourages us to complete a task we find difficult so that we can take 
pride in ourselves and what we achieve. Stress symptoms begin to 
manifest themselves when we feel that life demands are exceeding our 
ability to deal with them. Before stress begins to take its toll, we should 
do something to reduce, manage, and even counteract the negative 
side-effects of stress. Managing stress is all about taking charge of your 
thoughts, your emotions, your schedule, your environment, and the 
way you deal with problems. The ultimate goal is a balanced life, with 
time for work, relationships, relaxation, and fun; plus the flexibility to 
hold up under pressure and meet challenges head on.

In PR work, besides composing messages, transmitting through appropriate 
media, characteristics of the target audience have to be kept in mind. Use 
of language will be depending on the target group. PR persons have to take 
care of their disposition and inter-personal skills.

Use of Technology to Communicate

Technology has revolutionised the scope of communication. It has opened 
doors to a variety of information, knowledge and news all over the world. 

The more popular term is Information and Communication 
Technologies. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is 
an umbrella term that covers all technical means for processing and 
communicating information. While this technically encompasses pre-
digital technologies, including paper-based writing, it is most often used 
to describe digital technologies including methods for communication, 
transmission techniques, communications equipment, media , as well as 
techniques for storing and processing information. The term has gained 
popularity partially due to the union of information technology (IT) and 
telecom technology.

Scope
zz Corporate offices and other organisations need PR to cover all the 

communication that takes place between employer and employees. 

zz PR officer to extend communication with stockholders, media, press, 
NGOs, Government, customers and the general public. PR plays a 
crucial role in dealing with outside agencies.

zz Innovation in use of media and technologies. 267

Project 4 : Perception of 
Adolescents and Adults 
regarding Persons with 
Special Needs

Visit to the neighbouring areas and interviews with two adolescents 
and two adults regarding their perception of persons with special 
needs.

Content of the Project 

Identify two adolescents and two adults in the neighbourhood and interview 
them, using the given interview schedule, about their perceptions of 
persons with special needs. 

Purpose of Project

You have read that one of the career options that you can take up after 
specialising in the Human Development/Child Development stream is 
working with children and adults with disabilities. Doing this Project (and 
the next one) will help you to develop some ideas of this career option. 
Specifically, this Project will help you to understand what people in general 
think about persons with disabilities. Talking with people may also cause 
you to introspect about your own beliefs and perceptions. You may find 
that there are many similarities in your thinking. Think about whether 
you need to change some of your beliefs. 

Key Concepts in the Project/Learning Points in the Project 

Some important terms in this area include — adolescents, adults, 
neighbourhood, interview, interview schedule. We can say that these are 
the key concepts that we want you to understand through the Project. 
Why are you being asked to interview adolescents and adults? Why in 
the neighbourhood? And what is an interview and how is it different from 
talking to a person? You know:

1. That adolescence is the time when the person starts to focus on the 
self and others in a very deliberate and conscious manner. Recall 
your reading about the Development of Self in Class XI. The ability 
for abstract thinking makes it possible for the person to think of 
various possibilities. This is also the time when many values are 
in the process of being formed. The adolescent’s values and beliefs 
regarding diversity in humanity is important as it shapes everyday 275
interaction. 

Reprint 2025-26

Appendix - Projects



2. That adults often have well established opinions and beliefs — all of 
which may not necessarily be humane and just. Adults are also the 
ones who shape the attitude of children by their words and actions, 
directly and indirectly. Knowing their beliefs is important.

3. That you have been asked to interview adolescents and adults in 
your neighbourhood rather than interview people by visiting a centre 
or institution for people with disabilities. This means that persons 
with disabilities are a part of the society and we expect that most 
people would have some experience of interacting with people with 
disabilities. Therefore, we are asking you to interview people in the 
neighbourhood — we are not asking you to go to special places to look 
for people who would have interacted with people with disabilities. 

4. You have to find out perceptions by interviewing the people — not 
simply by talking to them. What is the difference between an interview 
and a talk? Interview is a major method of collecting information or 
‘data’ and doing this Project provides you exposure in this. Talking is 
an informal interaction between people. An interview is a conversation 
which is planned to some extent by the person who conducts the 
interview. The person doing the interview follows some rules in 
directing the talk. There is a certain way in which the interview should 
be conducted as well as there are ethics of an interview. We shall 
discuss these aspects in detail a little later. 

5. To conduct a good interview so that you get all the information that 
you want, you need to have some advance preparation. You need to 
think of the questions that you will ask. These are written out in the 
form of an interview schedule. While for now we are providing you 
the schedule that you will use to conduct the interview, in another 
section, we will talk about the guidelines for developing interview 
schedules. This will help you to understand why we have constructed 
the interview schedule the way we have. 

Preliminary Activities for the Project

1. Read the relevant section in the textbook of Class XII. You should be 
familiar with the persons with special needs.

2. Locate one adolescent and one adult. It would be good if you can 
identify one male and one female.

3. Become familiar with the interview schedule we have provided which 
you will use to collect the required information for this Project.

The Interview Schedule 

Instructions: Read out the instructions before starting the questions.

Introduction: I am a student of Class XII. We are conducting interviews 
with the public regarding their views about persons with 
disability. Please assist by answering the questions below:

1. Have you met or heard about anyone with a special need or disability? 
Yes or No? If Yes, who and where? Describe the problems.

2. Can you describe what you felt when you met or saw this person?

3. What did you first notice about the person?

4. What do you think were the abilities the person had?

A Note to the Teacher

Conduct a guided discussion in the class on:

I a) Interviewing

 b) Recording the answers given by interviewees

 c) Why was this activity done in your neighbourhood?

 d) Activities towards disability

II Report from the students should have:

 a) answers to interview

 b) concluding points

 (i) Diet

 (ii) Clothing

( iii) Activities

 (iv) Physical needs

 (v) Psychological needs

Procedure

Identify a child (11–18 years) or an older person who has a disability. 
Ensure that the child/adult is willing to be a participant and can answer 
your questions; alternatively his/her caregiver/family member can answer 
on his/her behalf.

Develop a set of questions in the form of an interview schedule that can 
elicit information in the areas listed above.

Note: Include questions, and ask them in a manner that you do not 
make the child/adult feel awkward, excluded or being labelled.

Conclusion

Draw up a brief profile of the child/adult, focussing on how he/she is 
similar to children/people who do not have a disability.

A Note for the Teacher

This project is expected to develop in students the ability to frame 
relevant questions, plan and conduct an interview and also write up 
a case profile.

by the teacher in this process. Then they decide as to how they will 
deliver the message. Once the plan is finalised, the group works on 
the message and develops the final product.
