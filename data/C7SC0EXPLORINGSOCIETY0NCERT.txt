To us, by its very geography, the country [India] appears to
be quite distinct from other countries, and that itself gives
it a certain national character.

In 1984, Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian astronaut to go into
space, spoke with the then Prime Minister of India, Indira
Gandhi. When she asked him, “How does India look from
space?”, he replied, “Sāre jahān se achchha” — better than the
whole world. (This is the title of a well-known poem of the early
20th century.)

LET’S EXPLORE
Look at the map of India at the end of this book. What are
you able to observe? Recall your lesson on different types
of landforms — mountains, plains and plateaus. Which
landforms can you identify on the map? What do the different
colours on the map mean? (Hint: The legend on the map shows
the heights of each area.)

India is the seventh-largest country in the world, and a part of
Asia. Along with its neighbours — Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal,
Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar — it forms the region known
as the Indian Subcontinent (subcontinent, since it is part of
the continent of Asia). Often, for the purpose of discussion, we
refer to five regions — the great mountain zone, the plains of the
Ganga and the Indus, the desert region, the southern peninsula,
and the islands. In this chapter, we will ‘fly’ over these zones,
providing you with a bird’s-eye view of these features and
offering glimpses of what things look like in close-up at some of
these places. It would be difficult to go into all the details at this
stage since, as you will soon see, India is large and diverse.
The Himalayan Mountain range stands as a natural barrier in
the north, while the Thar Desert and the Arabian Sea mark its
western limits. To the south, the Indian Ocean and to the east,
the Bay of Bengal form a natural boundary. These geographical
features create a separation between India and the rest of the
continent and have played a crucial role in shaping India’s
climate, culture, and history.

Do you recall your lesson on latitudes and longitudes?
Look at the map. Can you read, approximately, the latitude
and longitude where India lies?

Identify the above features on India’s physical map.

Let us now journey together from the Himalayas to the islands
in the Indian Ocean, and onward to the east of India. The diverse
colours on the map already give us a sense of the geographical
diversity. Familiarise yourself with the legend on the map. The
different colours indicate the altitudes.

The Himalayas

Look at the length of the Himalayan Range on the map. It is like
a massive wall. From the legend, can you guess the altitude at
different points of the Himalayas?

LET’S REMEMBER
The Himalayas seem to touch the sky. In fact, many of its peaks
are over 8000 metres in height and are together called the
‘Eight Thousanders’. This mountain range stretches across six
countries in Asia: India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, Pakistan, and
Afghanistan. Can you name the highest mountain in the world?
In the summer, the snow on the mountains melts and feeds
major rivers, such as the Ganga, Indus, and Brahmaputra. These
rivers and their tributaries provide water for drinking, farming,
and industrial use, connecting with the lives of hundreds of
millions of people. Hence, the Himalayas are sometimes called
the ‘Water Tower of Asia’. The Himalayas are also important to
many cultures and belief systems. The mountains themselves
are considered sacred, and temples and monasteries have been
built within them, attracting monks and spiritual seekers from
around the world who come to pray and meditate.

How the Himalayas were formed ...
an interesting story
A long, long time ago, India was part of a much
bigger landmass called ‘Gondwana’, where its
neighbour was Africa! At some point, it broke
away and slowly started moving north. About
50 million years ago, it reached the landmass
of Eurasia and collided with it. As India pushed
against Eurasia, the land between them
crumpled and rose up — just like how a carpet
wrinkles when you push it. That’s how the
mighty Himalayan mountains were formed!

to Eurasia

DON’T MISS OUT
The word ‘Himalaya’ is a combination of two Sanskrit
words — hima, meaning ‘snow’, and ālaya, meaning ‘abode’ or
‘dwelling’ — thus, ‘abode of snow’.

India and the World: Land and the People
1 –Geographical Diversity of India

Amazingly, India is still pushing into Asia
today, very slowly — about five centimetres
each year, which is much slower than the rate
at which your hair grows. This means the
Himalayas are still growing taller, just a tiny bit
each year — about five millimetres, but over a
millennium, that adds up to five metres!

The Himalayas are broadly categorised into three main ranges:



The Himadri (the Greater Himalayas) are the highest and
most rugged part of the range, home to towering peaks like
Mount Everest and Kanchenjunga. This region remains
snow-covered throughout the year. Life here is tough, and
there are not many human settlements.



The Himachal (the Lower Himalayas) lie south of the
Greater Himalayas and have a more moderate climate,
allowing rich biodiversity and human habitation. Popular
hill stations, such as Nainital (Uttarakhand), Darjeeling
(West Bengal), Shimla (Himachal Pradesh), and Mussoorie
(Uttarakhand), are located in this region.



The Shivalik Hills (the Outer Himalayas) form the
outermost and lowest range, consisting of rolling hills and
dense forests. These foothills are rich in wildlife, serving as
a transition zone between the Himalayas and the Gangetic
Plains (also called the Northern Plains).

The cold desert of India

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

The word ‘desert’ immediately evokes an image of a hot place.
However, there are also cold deserts, and we have one in India.
Ladakh is a cold desert where winter temperatures drop below
–30°C. There is very little rainfall, and the landscape is rugged,
with rocky terrain, deep
valleys, and lakes such as
Pangong Tso (tso means lake).

Chapter 1.indd 8

Fig. 1.8. Moonland, Ladakh

The terrain here resembles
that of the moon; hence, it is
called ‘moonland’. Geologists
explain the formation of this
terrain, as we saw earlier, by
the fact that the mountains
were ‘folded’ when the
Indian landmass collided
with Eurasia. This folded
portion was part of an ocean,
and so the rocks in this area

Fig. 1.9. Yaks are very important for the lives of people in the Himalayas. They

are made largely of sand and clay. Wind and rain have eroded
the mountains into the shapes you see in the photograph.

The Gangetic Plains
As we move southwards from the Himalayas, we reach the
vast and fertile Gangetic Plains. These plains have been an
important part of the history and civilisation of India. These
plains are nourished by mighty rivers originating from the
Himalayas, providing a vital lifeline: water. The Ganga, Indus,
and Brahmaputra river systems, along with their extensive
network of tributaries, enrich the soil with minerals, making the
region highly fertile and ideal for agriculture. The rivers bring
with them minerals that enrich the soil, enabling abundant
agriculture. The rivers are also a source for generating electricity.
A large proportion of India’s population lives in these plains.

Despite the harsh conditions, Ladakh is home to unique
wildlife like snow leopards, ibex, and Tibetan antelopes. The
Ladakhi people lead a simple life. The region is known for its

The flat land of the Northern Plains has allowed for the
development of an elaborate transportation network. Road and
railway networks facilitate the movement of people and goods
over long distances. As you will see in the Tapestry of the Past
chapters, the Ganga, the Brahmaputra and other rivers have
been used for millennia for travel and trade.

The Great Indian Desert or Thar Desert

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

If we move westward on the map, you will notice a yellowish
area. This area is the Thar Desert. What do you see? A vast stretch
of golden dunes, rugged terrain, and a wide-open sky?

LET’S EXPLORE
What is the shape of a sand dune? While mountains are
made of rock and their shape is fixed, why do you think sand
dunes also have a similar shape, even though they are made
of sand?

Fig. 1.22. Jaisalmer, the ‘Golden City’, located in the middle of the Thar desert in
India. The Jaisalmer fort is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Sand dunes are formed when the wind shifts and shapes the
sand into hill-like formations. Sometimes these rise as high as
150 metres.
The Thar is a vast arid region. Most of it lies within India,
spanning the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, and Haryana.
The desert acts as a natural barrier due to the harsh conditions
that deter human and animal movement — including very high
daytime temperatures and cold nights, as well as a lack of access
to water.

Chapter 1.indd 14

Water is scarce in the desert. Women often need to travel
long distances every day to fetch water for their families. So,
the traditional method for cleaning utensils is to scour them
with sand until they are clean. A little water can be used for a
light rinse. The water used for rinsing is reused for purposes
like watering a plant. So, the next time you leave the tap
running, remember the people of the Thar Desert. Rajasthan
is also famous for its ingenious water conservation methods,
including taanka or kunds. These are special water collection
systems that store rainwater, often for drinking purposes.

The Aravalli Hills
LET’S EXPLORE
Let’s go back to the map. Trace your path slowly from the
Thar Desert towards the east. Do you see the Aravalli Hills?
The Aravallis are among the oldest mountains in the world,
some 2.5 billion years old! The range has many peaks and ridges.
Although its highest peak, Mount Abu, towers at over 1700 m,
most of its hills are between 300 and 900 metres high. Isn’t it
fascinating that a drive of about 4 and a half hours can take us

from Mount Abu in the Aravallis to Jodhpur in the Thar Desert,
a drive into a completely different geography?

LET’S EXPLORE
Look at the political map in the textbook and identify the states
that the range spans. Did you see Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana
and Gujarat?

The Aravallis, rich in minerals
like marble, granite, zinc, and
copper, have supported mining and
construction activities for centuries.
In fact, evidence from its ancient
mines at Zawar has shown that over
eight centuries ago, Indians were
the first in the world to master the
delicate process of extraction of zinc.
Historic forts, such as Chittorgarh,
Kumbhalgarh, and Ranthambore, are
located here.

The Aravallis play a vital role in shaping the geography and
climate of northwestern India. One of its most important
functions is acting as a natural barrier, preventing the Thar
Desert from expanding further eastward. You will read more

The Peninsular Plateau
LET’S REMEMBER
A plateau is a landform that rises up from the surrounding
land and has a more or less flat surface; some of its sides are
often steep slopes.
India has several plateaus; the most important one is the
triangular peninsular area in the middle and south of the
country.
Peninsula:
A peninsula
is a piece of
land that is
surrounded
by water on
three sides.

It is also a very old land formation! Since this region is a peninsula,
surrounded by water on all three sides by the Arabian Sea, the Bay
of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean, it is called a peninsular plateau.
The plateau is bordered by two mountain ranges, the Western
Ghats and Eastern Ghats. The Western Ghats are taller and run
along the western coast like a wall, with many beautiful waterfalls
flowing down their steep sides during the monsoon season.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

DON’T MISS OUT
The Western Ghats have been declared a UNESCO World
Heritage Site. They are home to many rivers and have a rich
biodiversity. The northern portion of the Western Ghats are
also known as the Sahyadri Hills.
The Eastern Ghats are lower and broken into smaller hills
along the eastern coast. Between these mountain ranges lies the
Deccan Plateau, a vast area of flat highlands.
Rivers like the Godavari, Krishna, and Kaveri flow across the
plateau from west to east. These rivers are important for farming
and provide water to millions of people.

LET’S EXPLORE
Look at the physical map of India given at the end of the
book. Notice the direction of the flow of the rivers.

Fig. 1.27. Dense forests of Chhattisgarh, home to many tribal communities

This plateau is rich in minerals, forests, and fertile land,
making it vital for India’s economy. It tilts a little to the east, so
a few of the rivers in this region flow towards the Bay of Bengal.
East-flowing rivers like the Godavari, Krishna, and Mahanadi
originate here, providing water for farming, industries, and
hydroelectric power. There are west-flowing rivers (Narmada,
Tapti) too, which drain into the Arabian Sea.
Dense forests on the plateau are home to tribal communities,
including the Santhal, Gond, Baiga, Bhil, and Korku. These tribes
have distinct languages, traditions, and ways of life closely
connected to Nature.

Tribal communities are largely spread over the states of
Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Madhya Pradesh,
Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Gujarat. Examine
the physical and political maps at the end of this book to locate
the states and connect them to their location on the physical
map.
Plateaus are home to many beautiful waterfalls in India,
as rivers flow over their uneven and rocky surfaces. These
waterfalls not only attract tourists but also help in hydroelectric
power generation and provide water for irrigation.

multiple streams near the coast? Discuss with your teacher
in class to find out!

The West Coast of India
The West Coast of India stretches from Gujarat to Kerala, passing
through Maharashtra, Goa, and Karnataka. Most rivers here
originate in the Western Ghats, flow swiftly, and form estuaries.
The coastline is shaped by alluvial deposits from short rivers
and features coves, creeks, and estuaries, with the Narmada and
Tapti estuaries being the largest.

Chapter 1.indd 20

The East Coast lies between the Eastern
Ghats and the Bay of Bengal, stretching
from the Ganga delta to Kanyakumari.
It has wide plains and major river
deltas, including Mahanadi, Godavari,
Krishna, and Kaveri. Important water
bodies like Chilika Lake and Pulicat
Lake (a lagoon, which is a body of water
separated from larger bodies of water
by a natural barrier) are found here.
Deltas are landforms formed at the
mouth of a river when it deposits
sediments into a larger body of water,

Coast of India.
such as an ocean, a lake, or another
river. Over time, these sediments build up, forming a triangular
or fan-shaped area. The Godavari, Krishna, Kaveri and Mahanadi
rivers create fertile deltas, making the land ideal for farming.

Indian Islands
The Indian Islands refer to the group of islands scattered across
the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, and the Bay of Bengal,
which form part of India’s territory. India has two major island

groups — Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea and the Andaman
and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. These islands have
unique wildlife, beautiful beaches, coral reefs, and volcanoes.
Several ancient tribes made these islands their home tens of
thousands of years ago.

Lakshadweep islands
Lakshadweep is an archipelago (a group of islands) located in
the Arabian Sea, close to the Malabar coast of Kerala. It is made
up of 36 islands made of coral. Not all islands are inhabited by
people. India controls a vast marine area, allowing for fishing,
resource exploration, and environmental protection.

Before we move on …
Æ

India gives its name to the subcontinent it is a part of.

Æ

It has many diverse geographical features, ranging from
the snowy Himalayas to the heat of the Thar Desert. The
plains are watered by a large number of rivers. There is also
a peninsular plateau with the Arabian Sea on the west and
the Bay of Bengal in the east.

Æ

These diverse geographic features have created a variety
of conditions with respect to soil, flora, fauna, life and
economic opportunities, and honed a rich culture.

Weather and its Elements
You wake up one winter morning and shiver. You reach for
thick clothes to keep yourself warm. In the summer, you choose
clothes that keep you cool and comfortable. You are responding
to your body’s signals; your body is sensing the weather.

What is weather?

28

Chapter 2.indd 28

Weather is a state of
the Earth’s atmosphere
at a particular time and
Stratosphere
place. But what is an
Ozone Layer
Tropopause
atmosphere? In simple
terms, it is the layer of
Troposphere
gases that surround
some planets — in the
case of our Earth, we
call these gases ‘air’. The
Earth’s atmosphere may
Fig. 2.2
be compared to a cake
with several layers. The layer closest to the surface of the Earth is
called the ‘troposphere’, and that is where all land-based plants
and animals (including humans!) live and breathe. It is also
where almost all weather phenomena, which we will explore in
this chapter, take place. The troposphere extends to a height of
6 to 18 kilometres from the ground; it is less thick at the poles
(where the cold air contracts) and thicker in the tropical zone
(where the warmer air expands). You will study more about the
other layers in your Science classes.
We use many words to describe the weather — hot, cold, rainy,
cloudy, humid, snowy, windy, and so on. They describe the
different ways in which we experience the elements of weather.

LET’S EXPLORE
What are some of the words in your local language that you
use to describe the weather? Hot, cold, warm, chilly, crisp,
pleasant, and so on, are commonly used terms in English.

08-04-2025 12:42:20

The elements of weather are:




Temperature: How hot or cold the atmosphere is.



Atmospheric Pressure: The weight of the air above us, felt
on the Earth’s surface.



Wind: The movement of air, including its speed
and direction.



Precipitation: Any form of water, such as rain, snow, sleet
or hail, that falls from the sky.

Humidity: The amount of water vapour in the air.

THINK ABOUT IT

Sleet:
Frozen or partly
frozen rain.
Hail:
Small, hard
balls of ice that
fall from the
sky like rain.
Water vapour:
Water vapour
is water in
gaseous
instead of
liquid form.

Let us imagine that Krishnan from Chennai is speaking with
Amir in Kashmir. Krishnan tells Amir that it has become
chilly in Chennai after it rained the previous night. Amir asks
him how cold it is. How will Krishnan explain to Amir how
cold it is? After all, what is cold for Krishnan may be quite
pleasant for Amir!
As you can see, it would be difficult for Krishnan to convey his
sense of chillness to Amir unless there is a commonly agreed way
to measure the temperature. It is the same with other elements
of the weather. In this chapter, we will learn how we measure
the weather using common standards.

What do you think could be some other reasons to measure
the weather more precisely? (Hint: Think how knowing the
weather a few hours or a few days in advance would help you
plan some activities.)
From early times, humans have closely observed Nature and
learnt to read her signals to forecast the weather. Observing birds
flying low, ants carrying eggs, squirrels gathering nuts, frogs
croaking loudly, or even the opening and closing of pine cones,
provided valuable information about coming rain or storms. This
knowledge has been passed down from generation to generation.
Even today, in many parts of India, people use traditional ways
to predict the weather, especially the arrival of the monsoon.

LET’S EXPLORE
Talk to elders in your neighbourhood and ask them how they
predict the weather. What signs do they observe? Document
any sayings in your regional language that refer to weather
prediction.
In the last few centuries, scientists have worked out methods to
measure and monitor the elements of the weather with great
precision. Based on those inputs, meteorologists try to predict
how the weather will behave in a particular region after a few
hours or a few days, or even a few weeks. How do they do it? Do
they just look up at the sky and guess? No, they’ve got some cool
gadgets, a few of which we will now look at.

Weather Instruments
a) Temperature
LET’S REMEMBER
In your Grade 6 Science textbook, Curiosity, you read about
different types of thermometers used for measuring the
temperature — the clinical thermometer and the laboratory
thermometer. You also learnt about temperature scales.
One of them is the Celsius scale; another is the Fahrenheit
scale. If, for instance, we have a cool temperature of 15
degrees Celsius (noted as 15°C), it is the same as 59 degrees
Fahrenheit (noted as 59°F).

There are several types of thermometers. Some simply measure

minimum temperatures during a day. Thermometers often use a
coloured liquid which expands when the temperature increases.
However, more and more, digital thermometers are preferred as
they are more precise and can record more data.
Indeed, temperature recordings can be used to collect some
useful statistics, including:



Range of temperature or the maximum temperature minus
the minimum temperature during a particular period of
time (usually 24 hours).



Mean daily temperature or the maximum temperature
plus the minimum temperature of the day divided by two.

a little cold, he and Amir would have a measure they
could understand. What do you think Amir’s reaction to
Krishnan’s statement might be?

If the news says that a particular
place received 30 mm of rainfall in
a day, what does it mean? How is
rainfall measured?
The amount of rainfall is measured
with the help of an instrument called
a rain gauge (Fig. 2.6). When it rains,
the water falls into a funnel and is
collected in a cylinder. A scale is
attached to the cylinder to measure
the depth of rainwater collected.
For example, when the height of the
water collected is 5 mm, we say that
the area received 5 mm of rainfall.

08-04-2025 12:42:27

LET’S EXPLORE
Make a rain gauge as shown in the diagram above. Place the
rain gauge in an open area, away from objects that might
obstruct rain. Ensure that the rain gauge is on a flat surface
and will not tilt or topple with the wind. Using the measuring
scale, record the amount of rainwater collected at the same
time every day, for a month. (If there is snow, allow it to
melt before taking the measurement.) Calculate the average
rainfall for every week in that month and comment on the
variation from week to week.

c) Atmospheric pressure
Our bodies are quite aware of temperature and rainfall. But you
may also have experienced that the weather sometimes feels
‘heavy’, as before a thunderstorm. This is related to atmospheric
pressure, which is the pressure exerted by the weight of the air
above and around us.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

The atmospheric pressure is higher near the sea coast and
lower as we go higher up into the mountains. When you climb a
mountain, the air gets thinner than in the plain below. As a result,
the air pressure is lower, and there is less oxygen available for

34

your lungs to take in. With less oxygen getting into your blood,
your body has to work harder to keep you moving! That’s why
people sometimes feel breathless, dizzy or tired at high altitudes.
This does not mean that the atmospheric pressure is always high
in the plains below or on the coast. In fact, it sometimes drops
dramatically, resulting in what meteorologists call a ‘depression’
or ‘low-pressure system’, which can sometimes develop into a
storm or even a cyclone.

THINK ABOUT IT
Why do you think it would be important to measure
atmospheric pressure? Who are the people most likely to use
such measurements?

THINK ABOUT IT
​ eople who journey to places
P
at a high altitude are advised
to make pauses on the way to
allow the body to acclimatise.
Our army personnel serve
in high-altitude places like
Khardung la in Ladakh, which
is over 5600 metres above sea
level. It is hard to imagine
how they live and work in
places where the oxygen level
is so low — the atmospheric
pressure there is generally
about 650 millibars!

India and the World: Land and the People

The instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure is called
a barometer. As with thermometers, there are several types
of barometers. The unit they display is generally the millibar
(abbreviated as mb). The normal atmospheric pressure at the
sea coast is around 1013 mb; a pressure below 1000 mb indicates
a depression.

35

Chapter 2.indd 35

08-04-2025 12:42:30

d) Wind
Wind is the movement of air from areas of high pressure to
areas of low pressure. Speed and direction are two important
factors when we describe the wind.

THINK ABOUT IT

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

Have you seen seeds like these flying in the wind? What
would happen to the seeds if there was no wind?

36

Chapter 2.indd 36

Fig. 2.9

The wind is an important element of the weather. Its direction
and speed help in weather forecasting. Besides, air pilots
and sailors need to be aware of wind data, as the wind has a
great influence on flying or sailing. Farmers also use the wind
direction to predict where rain might come from. Also, a greater
wind speed will cause the soil to dry faster.
So, how do we measure this direction and speed? A wind vane
(or weather vane) has a rotating arm with a pointer at one end
and a tail at the other. When the wind blows, the tail is pushed,
and the pointer turns in the direction of the wind. It responds
even to a light breeze.

08-04-2025 12:42:33

Fig. 2.10. Left: Wind vane on the tarmac. Right: Anemometer

This wind vane on the tarmac is called a ‘wind sock’. It gives
pilots an indication of the direction of the wind during take-off
and landing. Similar socks are used in industries that release
ash or gases.
The simplest instrument to measure the wind direction and
speed is the anemometer. It has three or four metal cups that
rotate on a vertical shaft when the wind blows — the stronger
the wind, the faster the rotation. A meter attached at the bottom
counts how many times the anemometer spins in a certain
period of time and calculates the wind speed in kilometres per
hour (km/h).
Humidity is the last element of the weather on our list. It refers
to the amount of water vapour present in the air. It also depends
on factors like temperature, wind, pressure and location.

LET’S EXPLORE
Where do you think humidity is likely to be more, Kochi or
Jaipur? You might guess that Kochi has higher humidity than
Jaipur because it is located near the sea. But how will we know
for sure? If we had to compare the humidity level between
Kochi and Mangaluru, how would we do it? Discuss with your
classmates.

e) Humidity

37

08-04-2025 12:42:33

We can answer these questions more precisely by learning how
to measure humidity.
Before we move forward, we need to remember our Science
lesson from Grade 6 about the states of water. This will help us
to understand how humidity is measured.

LET’S REMEMBER
Æ

When water evaporates, it causes a cooling effect.

Æ

If the amount of water in the air is already high (more
humidity), water evaporates slowly. That is typically the
case on a rainy day.

Humidity of the air is measured as relative humidity: air that
would contain absolutely no water vapour (which is impossible
in natural conditions) is rated at 0%, while air saturated with
water vapour will have a humidity of 100%. In practice, dry
weather has a relative humidity range between 20% and 40%,
while humid weather usually falls between 60% and 80% relative
humidity.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

THINK ABOUT IT
If the humidity in Delhi is at 52% while in Kochi it is 84%, in
which of the two places are wet clothes likely to dry faster?
And where are you likely to sweat more, assuming the
temperature is the same in both places?
But how do we measure such numbers? This is done through an
instrument called a hygrometer. Again, there are several types
of hygrometers, depending on the principle they are based on.
The measurement of humidity is of great importance in many
industrial processes, such as food processing. Museums also
monitor humidity as they need to maintain a dry environment
to preserve their exhibit.

38

Weather Stations
As you can see, we need several
instruments to measure the weather at
a particular place and time. A weather
station brings all these instruments
together, making it easy to measure
and track the weather. Readings of all
the measurements are taken at regular
intervals, which helps in mapping and
forecasting the weather.

An automated weather station

Fig. 2.11

An Automated Weather Station (AWS) is a self-operating
system that uses various sensors to measure and record weather
data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction,
precipitation, and atmospheric pressure. Such stations are
widely used in fields like agriculture, aviation, navigation,
environmental monitoring, and so on, providing accurate
and timely weather information without the need for human
intervention.

In 2023, the National Disaster
Management Authority set
up an AWS at a glacial lake of
Sikkim at an altitude of more
than 4800 metres above sea
level. The AWS provides early
information about upcoming
weather conditions.

Accurate predictions help us to be ready for such events. They
also enable local governments to mobilise resources and prepare
for any disasters. For example, if stormy weather is expected at
sea, fishermen are warned about venturing out in their boats, or
an entire coastal area might have to be evacuated if a cyclone is
expected.

fires are spreading.

Weather, Seasons and the Climate
‘Climate’ is a word people use in everyday conversations. But,
quite often, what they really mean is ‘weather’, and not ‘climate’.
What’s the difference? ‘Weather’ is what we experience every
hour or day: it might be raining, or there could be bright
sunshine, a lot of wind, etc. The weather keeps changing. Climate,
on the other hand, is the pattern of weather an area or a region
experiences over a long period of time — several decades at
least. This pattern varies from region to region.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

Before we come to the various types of climates, let us briefly stop
to introduce seasons. Seasons occur as the Earth revolves around
the Sun. Each season lasts for a few months and recurs every
year. As we know, there are several seasons in the year — spring,
summer, monsoon, autumn and winter — that occur in a cycle.
Are seasons related to the weather or to the climate? The answer
is: to both.

46

Chapter 3.indd 46

The weather changes with the season, that is, it can be dry and
hot in the summer months, or humid and rainy during the
monsoon. Further, the pattern of seasons in a region is closely
connected with the climate. There are four main seasons across
most regions of the world — spring, summer, autumn and winter.
However, India receives rainfall during a specific period of the
year — the ‘rainy season’ or monsoon — along with the other
four.

Fig. 3.2

Traditionally, in many parts of India, the year is divided into six
seasons or ṛitus — vasanta (spring), grīṣhma (summer), varṣhā
(rainy season), śharad (autumn), hemanta (pre-winter), śhiśhir
(winter). Specific rituals and festivals are associated with these
six ṛitus, such as Vasanta Pañchamī or Śharad Pūrṇima.

08-04-2025 12:45:33

If we observe the world around us, we will notice that human,
plant and animal life are in rhythm with the ṛitus or seasons.
The crops we grow, the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and so
on, change with the season. Depending on the region, some trees
and shrubs bloom with the onset of vasanta or spring, in some
places they shed their leaves or change their colour as śharad or
autumn approaches and some animals develop thick fur in the
cold winter months.

Discuss in groups of three or four and find out whether
there are specific events connected to the seasons in your
region. Collect information about them — songs, feasts
with specific types of food, practices in different seasons,
etc. Document these and share your discoveries with your

Do you know which trees in your area change colours
before the onset of winter? Are there trees that shed their
leaves around this time? Why do you think this happens?
Find out and document the local names of these trees.

Usually, the climate remains stable over long periods of time.
However, scientists have been recording changes in the climates
of the world in the recent decades. Studies show that many of
these changes have been caused by human actions.
Let us recapitulate:



Weather is what we experience from day to day — windy,
rainy, hot, dry, etc.



Seasons recur every year and the weather of a place is
different in every season.



Climate is the long-term pattern in a particular region. There
are many types of climates in the world. We will now survey
the main types found in India.

Types of Climates in India

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

We have often seen how India is a land of diversity. This is
equally true of its climate:

48

Chapter 3.indd 48



In the north, the Himalayan mountains have an alpine
climate with cold, snowy winters and cool summers (the
word ‘alpine’ comes from the Alps, a mountain range of
Europe). That’s probably where you will see the thickest
clothing in India!



Lower in the Himalayas, and in many hilly areas of India,
the climate is often said to be temperate, as the winters are
moderately cold and the summers not too hot. That is where
we find many ‘hill stations’, much frequented by people
seeking relief from the heat in the plains below.

Fig. 3.3



In the northern plains, the climate is
subtropical, with very hot summers
and cold winters. This is where most
of India’s wheat is grown.



In the west, the Thar Desert has an
arid climate featuring extremely
hot days, cool nights, and very little
rainfall. People there have had to
develop unique ways to collect and
save water.



The western coastal strip receives heavy rainfall during
monsoon months, creating a tropical wet climate, which is
favourable to the growing of rice and spices.



The central Deccan Plateau has a semi-arid climate with hot
summers, mild winters and moderate rainfall during the
rainy season.



Eastern India and the southern peninsula experience a
tropical climate with a mild winter and distinct wet and dry
periods controlled by monsoon winds (more on them soon).

Note: You will understand later the meaning of the terms
‘tropical’ and ‘subtropical’, which are related to two special
parallels of latitude called the ‘tropics’.

Factors Determining the Climate
What creates those different climates? There are many factors at
work. Some are general ones — on the scale of the planet — while
others are regional or even local. Let’s examine a few.

a) Latitude
LET’S REMEMBER

Places near the Equator,
that is, at low latitudes,
are warmer, while those
near the poles (high
Solar radiation
latitudes) are colder.
This happens due to the
angle at which the sun’s
rays hit a particular
area. At the Equator,
Atmosphere
the rays are nearly
perpendicular, and so all
At the equator exposure to the sun’s rays is

concentrated, but near the poles it is dispersed
on a smaller area of the
over a wide area
Fig. 3.4
Earth’s surface. In the
polar regions, the rays are inclined or oblique, and the energy
is distributed over a larger surface. Moreover, they have to pass
through more of the Earth’s atmosphere, as the diagram shows,
which further dissipates their energy. As a result, the polar
regions receive less heat than the equatorial zone. We can see
this in India too: Kanniyakumari and the Nicobar Islands being
close to the Equator are warm or hot almost throughout the year,
whereas places in the north, such as Srinagar, are much cooler.

Chapter 3.indd 49

India and the World: Land and the People
3 – Climates of India

We studied about latitudes in Grade 6. Do you remember that
latitudes measure the distance from the Equator, increasing
as we move away from it (either northward or southward)?
While the climate around the Equator is extremely hot, as
the latitude increases it becomes temperate and then cold or
frigid. Why is this so?

49

08-04-2025 12:45:35

b) Altitude
We mentioned hill stations above, which are popular tourist
centres because of their cooler climate. India has many
including Munnar, Theni, Udhagamandalam (Ooty), Madikeri,
Mahabaleshwar, Mount Abu, Shimla, Nainital, Darjeeling,
Tawang, Shillong, etc. We know they are located at a higher
altitude than the plains below, but how does that explain their
cooler temperature? You will later learn the full answer in your
Science classes.
To keep things simple for now, the temperature decreases as the
altitude increases because:

2.

The atmospheric pressure, and therefore the air density,
decreases as the altitude increases (as we saw in the chapter
‘Understanding the Weather’), and as the air gets less dense,
it gets cooler.
The sun heats the surface of the Earth, and so the farther away
from the surface, the less hot the air will be. The Himalayas
are so high that many peaks maintain a temperature below
water’s freezing point, keeping them covered in snow.

08-04-2025 12:45:37

LET’S EXPLORE
Udhagamandalam (Ooty) and Coimbatore are almost at the
same latitude. The range of summer temperatures in Ooty is
10–25° while that in Coimbatore is 25 –38°. Why do you think
there is such a difference in temperature between these two
places?

c) Proximity to the sea

result is that those

regions tend to be more temperate. As you move inland from
the coast, the temperatures get more extreme — summer
temperatures will be higher and winter temperatures lower. For
instance, Mumbai and Nagpur are located at a similar latitude,
but Mumbai, being near the sea, has cooler summers (around
32°C) and milder winters (around 18°C), while Nagpur, away
from the coast, experiences up to 44°C in summer and about
10°C in winter. As you can see, Mumbai’s range of temperature
(i.e. the difference between the maximum and the minimum) is
about 14°C while the range at Nagpur reaches 34°C.

d) Winds
Wind can move masses of warmer or cooler air. States like
Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh often receive
winds blowing from the west. Having travelled over the deserts
of Arabia to Afghanistan, they bring dry and hot air that causes
severe heat waves in summer. In winter cold winds from across
the Himalayas creep into the Himalayan foothills, resulting in
cold waves.

in contrast, winds
coming from the sea

result in rainfall.

LET’S REMEMBER
Topography:
The totality
of the
physical
surface
features of
an area. This
may include
mountains,
hills, valleys,
slopes,
coasts, etc.

In your Grade 6 Science textbook ‘Curiosity’ you studied
the water cycle! “The water from the ocean and the Earth’s
surface evaporates into the atmosphere as vapour and
returns as rain, hail or snow….”

e) Topography
Finally, the topography of a region also plays an important
role in determining its climate. For instance, the Himalayas
and the Karakoram ranges protect, to some extent, the Indian

52

Chapter 3.indd 52

08-04-2025 12:45:41

subcontinent from the winds of the cold deserts of Central Asia.
The nearly flat topography of the Thar desert, on the other
hand, has nothing to protect it from hot and dry winds. In the
next section, we will see the role of the Western Ghats in India’s
southwest monsoon.
Putting it all together...
The climate of any region is determined collectively by all the
above factors. Describing the climate involves a description of
the patterns of temperature, precipitation (rain or snowfall,
occurrence of fog or mist) and wind conditions in a region over
three decades or more.
A microclimate is a climate localised in a small area, which
differs from the climate in the surrounding region. It has a

unique pattern of temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc., in a
small geographical area.
For instance, enclosed valleys and some forests have microclimates of their own. So do ‘urban heat islands’, that is, some
cities that have a large number of buildings and other concrete
structures and very little vegetation; all this traps the heat and
they are often much warmer than the surrounding region.
Microclimates can influence the local flora and fauna, the crops
grown, and impact human health and well-being.

The Monsoons
The monsoon season is central to life in India. During the
monsoon months, the rivers fill up, the soil is soaked with
water, crops grow and life thrives. Strictly speaking, the word
‘monsoon’, which comes from the Arabic word mausim, meaning
‘season’, refers to seasonal winds over a large area of the Indian
Ocean and surrounding regions, including Australia, Africa and
South Asia.
There is a yearly pattern to the monsoons. Their mechanism
is complex, but based on the simple fact that land heats up
or cools down faster than the ocean. Monsoons bring out the
fundamental relationship between temperature, pressure and
wind movement.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

A. Summer

54

Chapter 3.indd 54

To put it simply, as summer begins, the Asian landmass heats
up, creating a powerful low-pressure system over it. Since air
always flows from high pressure to low pressure, winds are
drawn from the cooler, high-pressure ocean towards the hot
land. These ocean winds carry moisture that condenses over
the warmer land and falls in the form of heavy monsoon rains.
(That is why ‘monsoon’ commonly refers to the seasonal rains
rather than the winds.)
B. Winter

northeast monsoon

The pattern reverses in winter,
when the landmass cools down
more rapidly than the ocean. Now the land has a high-pressure
system while the ocean remains warmer with relatively
lower pressure. This causes the winds to blow in the opposite
direction — from the land towards the ocean — bringing dry
conditions to much of Asia.

08-04-2025 12:45:41

Coming to India, the monsoon rains typically advance from
the southern tip of India in early June, moving northward over
several weeks until they cover the entire subcontinent by midJuly. It is not a smooth progression, though the Western Ghats
(remember our brief survey of topography) act as a natural
barrier; their western slopes receive much rainfall, while
the Deccan plateau to the east receive less, and often with
interruptions. This is commonly called the summer or southwest
monsoon (‘southwest’ reflecting the direction the winds come
from).
As winter approaches, the winds reverse and blow from the
land to the ocean, as we just saw. These are dry winds that bring
cold weather to south India, but a part of them, passing over the
Bay of Bengal, collect some moisture and bring rainfall to parts
of east and south India. This is called the winter or northeast
monsoon.

LET’S EXPLORE
Since the ability to predict the monsoon rainfall has been
an important aspect of life in India, our ancestors observed
Nature around them carefully. They developed local
traditional knowledge through their experience. This
traditional knowledge is an important heritage we must
preserve. For example, fishermen on the Konkan coast
predict the onset of the monsoon when fishes that normally
stay under water are seen at the surface; in parts of southern
India monsoon is said to arrive within 50 days after the Golden
Shower tree (Cassia fistula) blossoms. Some communities also
believe that when crows build their nests high on tree-tops, it
indicates less rainfall, whereas if the nests are lower, rainfall
is likely to be heavy. Make a list of such local knowledge about
rain, fog, snow or hail in your area.

Climate and our Lives

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

Our lives are deeply connected with the climate and dependent
on it. The impact of climate is visible in local cultures for
instance, and India has many festivals associated with seasons
and agricultural activities.

56

Chapter 3.indd 56

LET’S EXPLORE
Reach out to your grandparents or elders in your
neighbourhood. Ask them about the traditional festivals
and dances they remember from their childhood and youth,
especially those related to agriculture and rain. What rituals
did they participate in? Then organise a cultural fest with
your friends. You can showcase some of the dances, songs
and activities your elders shared with you. Whether it is a
dance, harvest ritual, or a simple story about a prayer to rain
gods, try to bring these traditions to life for your classmates.
The climate also has a direct impact on the economy. For instance,
you may have heard the phrase ‘monsoon failure’, which refers

to poor rainfall during the monsoon season; in such a case, the
agriculture suffers, people (women, generally) have to walk
long distances in search of water, and agricultural labourers are
likely to migrate to the cities; food (grains, vegetables and fruits,
to begin with) becomes costlier, fuelling inflation. Industrial
activity also often depends on a predictable weather and the
availability of water. The world over, we can easily detect such
connections between the climate and socioeconomic conditions.
Those conditions get especially strained when climate disasters
strike.

Climates and Disasters
India’s diverse weather patterns can bring about extreme
conditions such as cyclones, floods, landslides and other such
climate-related disasters. These events affect people’s lives,
disrupt agriculture, damage infrastructure and disturb local
economies.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

a) Cyclones

58

Chapter 3.indd 58

Every year, the Indian coastline, especially the eastern coast,
witness several cyclones. In past years, some of them have been
highly destructive, resulting in the loss of human and animal
life, damaging property and infrastructure, uprooting trees
and causing soil erosion. The India Meteorological Department
(IMD) keeps track of coming cyclones and provides information
on their formation, evolution, place of landing, etc.

DON’T MISS OUT

Fig. 3.12

The National Disaster Response Force
(NDRF) is specially trained to respond
to natural as well as human-made
disasters. NDRF battalions are located
at 12 different locations in India. The
NDRF has played a key role in rescue
and evacuation during disasters like
cyclones, landslides and floods.

08-04-2025 12:45:46

How are cyclones formed? We saw that in some special
situations, the atmospheric pressure near the sea becomes
lower than the surrounding areas, creating a low-pressure
system. This is an invitation to the air from surrounding areas
to come into the low-pressure area, and the air from the sea
moves in, bringing with it moisture and rain. When the lowpressure system is intense and the wind speeds are high, this
may result in a cyclone.
As winds collect moisture, they form clouds and rotate inwards
towards the centre of the depression. This centre, which is
cloudless, is called ‘the eye of the cyclone’.

What are clouds? White lumps in the sky, you might say.
But what are they made of? The answer is simple — water.
But not just any water; clouds are masses of water droplets,
ice crystals, or a mixture of both, that are suspended in the
atmosphere.

b) Floods

60

Chapter 3.indd 60

A flood occurs when water overflows into normally dry land.
This could be due to heavy rainfall generating huge run-off water
that the land cannot absorb, or due to excessive accumulation of
water in bodies like rivers and lakes, until the water overflows
or their banks are breached. Floods occur frequently during the
monsoons. States such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Kerala, Andhra
Pradesh and Assam are particularly vulnerable to floods.

LET’S EXPLORE
Have you seen or read about floods? Look at the physical
map of India. Discuss in pairs why you think floods occur in
the areas mentioned above.
In the Himalayan regions, on the other hand, floods occur when
glacial lakes overflow. Glacial lakes form a barrier of rocks and
ice to hold their water, which often comes from melting glaciers.
If the glaciers melt too fast (as is increasingly the case) or if there
is too much rainfall, the build-up of pressure can cause the water

Cyclone
Forest Fire

Flood

Fig. 3.15

to break through the barrier — this is called a glacial burst and
it often has devastating consequences for people and property.

In 2013, Uttarakhand experienced a sudden glacial burst
caused by continuous heavy rain over several days. Many
landslides followed. Areas around one of India’s important
sacred sites, the Kedarnath temple, were completely
destroyed. Several villages were washed away in the floods,
along with many roads and bridges. Altogether about 6,000
people, many of them pilgrims, lost their lives.
Many cities experience flooding when there is heavy rainfall.
This may be due to an overburdened drainage system or poorly
planned construction encroaching on the waterways and
blocking the flow of water. Besides, urban surfaces of concrete
or asphalt do not allow water to be absorbed by the earth.

c) Landslides
A landslide is the sudden collapse of rock, soil, or debris, often
triggered by heavy rain, earthquakes or volcanic activity.
Landslides are common in hilly and mountainous regions such
as Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal
Pradesh, as well as the Western Ghats and hilly regions. These
events often occur during the monsoon.
In those regions, the chances of landslides have increased due
to human activities such as the cutting down of forests, building
infrastructure without following approved methods and the
construction of too many buildings that block the natural flow
of water.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

d) Forest fires
Forest fires are uncontrolled fires that spread rapidly across
vegetation, often fuelled by dry climatic conditions, droughts
or high winds. Human carelessness is another frequent cause.
Forest fires are common in states with large forested or grassland
areas such as Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh
and Chhattisgarh, as well as mountain ranges such as the
Western Ghats. Apart from destroying large areas of forest, fires
harm wildlife, degrade the ecosystem, spoil the air quality and
displace local communities. The consequences are therefore
both environmental and economic.

Climate Change

India and the World: Land and the People
3 – Climates of India

Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the
climate. This may be on the scale of the planet or on a regional
scale, and it involves shifts in temperature, precipitation and
weather events. In past millennia (we can go back millions of
years, in fact), natural processes drove climate change. Since the
19th century, however, climate change has been largely driven
by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels,
deforestation, environmentally harmful industrial practices, and
production and patterns of excessive or wasteful consumption.

64

Chapter 3.indd 64

Why does the burning of fossil fuels affect the climate? In the
Earth’s natural carbon cycle, carbon dioxide (CO2) and other
gases are released gradually into the atmosphere and trap heat
from the Sun. This natural ‘greenhouse effect’ warms Earth
enough to support life. However, human activities like industry,
transportation, and agriculture have released enormous
amounts of these ‘greenhouse gases’ in just a few centuries. This
sudden increase traps extra heat, causing rapid global warming
and disrupting the climate patterns that plants, animals, and
human societies have adapted to over thousands of years.
In India, rising temperatures are perceptible in many regions.
Early in 2025, for instance, the country’s average temperature
was 1 to 3°C above normal, as a result of which the winter
was much shorter and milder than usual. This affects not only
agricultural production but also many small-scale industries.
This is only one example showing how a warmer planet will
present us with increasing challenges.
Understanding the relationship between the causes of climate
change and disasters can help us to prepare better for these
challenges. It also supports the need for more environmentfriendly practices and building resilience and adaptation in
communities. Governments worldwide, including India’s,
attempt to promote measures of climate mitigation, such as
cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions, planting trees,
boosting renewable energy and improving energy efficiency,
promoting sustainable lifestyles, etc. But these often clash with a
desire for economic growth and increased consumption.

Before we move on ...

Let us recall that in the early 2nd millennium BCE (that is,
over a few centuries after 2000 BCE), the Indus / Harappan /
Sindhu-Sarasvatī civilisation, which we called India’s
‘First Urbanisation’, disintegrated. Some of its cities were
abandoned; in others, some people continued living
there, but reverting to a rural or village lifestyle. They
had to, since all the components of the Harappan urban
order had disappeared: elaborate structures, both private
and public; crowded streets and busy markets; different
communities with specialised occupations (metalsmiths,
potters, builders, weavers, craftspeople, and so on); a
writing system; a sanitation system; the presence of an
administration; and, behind it all, a larger state structure
with a ruling class at the head. And for a whole millennium,
urban life remained absent from India, though there may
have been a few towns here and there in north India.

Indeed, there were important regional cultures, which we
need not study here.
Then, in the 1st millennium BCE, a vibrant new phase of
urbanisation began in the Ganga plains, parts of the Indus
(or Sindhu) basin and neighbouring regions, gradually
spreading to other parts of the Subcontinent. How do we
know this? Mainly from two sources: (1) archaeological
excavations that have confirmed the existence of those
ancient urban centres, and (2) ancient literature describing
them — late Vedic, Buddhist and Jain literatures are full of
references to these new urban centres.
This new phase is often called India’s ‘Second
Urbanisation’ — which, incidentally, has continued right
up to today! Let us see how this phase emerged.

Janapadas and Mahājanapadas

The janapadas grew as trade networks expanded and
connected them. By the 8th or 7th centuries BCE, some
of those early states had merged together; the resulting
bigger units were known as mahājanapadas. Although
the texts have different lists of them, the more frequent
list gives the names of 16 mahājanapadas, extending from
Gandhāra in the northwest to Anga in the east and to
Aśhmaka in central India, close to the Godavari River (see
map). There may have been a few more, along with some
smaller janapadas continuing independently.

Chapter 4.indd 69

Tapestry of the Past
4 – New Beginnings: Cities and States

Towards the end of the 2nd millennium BCE, regional
cultures gradually reorganised themselves in north India.
As people formed clans or groups, probably sharing a
common language and common customs, each clan came
to be associated with a territory or janapada led by a
rājā or ruler. (‘Janapada’ is a Sanskrit word which means
‘where the people (jana) have set foot (pada),’ that is, have
settled down.)

THINK ABOUT IT
Notice how many of the mahājanapadas are concentrated in
the Ganga plains. There are several possible reasons for this,
including the growth of agriculture in the fertile Ganga plains,
the availability of iron ore in the mountains and hills (see
below about iron), and the formation of new trade networks.

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ The most powerful of these new states were Magadha,
Kosala, Vatsa and Avanti. Looking at the map, can you
identify their capitals? Also, how many can you match
with Indian cities of today?

Æ Compare this map with the map of the regions mentioned
in the Mahābhārata (see Fig. 5.4 in the chapter ‘India, That
Is Bharat’ in Grade 6) and list the names common to both
maps. What do you think this implies?

The map (Fig. 4.3) shows the mahājanapadas’ capitals. Most
were fairly large well-fortified cities, with a moat running
outside the fortifications as further defence. Often, the
gateways through the rampart walls would be deliberately
kept narrow, so guards may control the movement of people
and goods entering or leaving the city. It is fascinating to
note that most of those ancient capitals continue to be living
cities today — ‘modern’ cities that are often 2,500 years old!

Early Democratic Traditions
Each janapada had an assembly or council, called sabhā
or samiti, where matters concerning the clan would be
discussed. (Remember, from the chapter on ‘India’s Cultural
Roots’, that the words sabhā and samiti first appear in the
Vedas, India’s most ancient texts.) We may assume that
most of the members were elders in the clan. The rājā
was not expected to rule independently or arbitrarily;

a good ruler was supposed to take the advice from those
assemblies, apart from the ministers and administrators.
Indeed, according to some texts, an incompetent ruler
could be removed by the assembly. Of course, while such
mentions are significant, it does not mean that this was an
established law; let us remember that the data we have for
such remote periods is incomplete.
In their political systems, the mahājanapadas expanded
the basic principles of the janapadas. Some were, in effect,
monarchies, in the sense that the rājā was the ultimate
authority, supported by ministers and an assembly of

elders. His position was hereditary, in the sense that a rājā
would usually be the son of the previous one. The king
would collect taxes or revenue, maintain law and order,
get impressive fortifications built around their capital, and
maintain an army to defend the territory or wage war with
neighbouring ones, as the case may be. Magadha (located
in part of today’s Bihar), Kosala (in part of today’s Uttar
Pradesh) and Avanti (in part of today’s Madhya Pradesh)
were among the most powerful such states.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

However, at least two mahājanapadas, Vajji (or Vṛijji) and
the neighbouring Malla, had a different system: the sabhā
or samiti had more power and took important decisions
through discussion, and, if necessary, through vote.
Surprisingly, this included the selection of the rājā! This
means that those mahājanapadas, which were called gaṇas
or sanghas, were not monarchies — their functioning might
be called democratic, since members of the assembly were
the ones to select the ruler and take major decisions. In fact,

scholars have often called them ‘early republics’, as they
are indeed one of the earliest such systems in the world.

More Innovations

Urbanisation does not happen without technologies. Let us
remember that the Harappan civilisation mastered copper
and bronze metallurgy. Now, in this Second Urbanisation,
a major shift in technology involved iron metallurgy. In
several regions of India, the techniques of extracting and
shaping iron were actually perfected from the early 2nd
millennium BCE, but it took a few centuries for iron to
become a part of daily life. By the late 2nd millennium BCE,
iron tools had become widespread, facilitating agriculture
on a bigger scale. Iron also made better weapons than
bronze, lighter and sharper — swords, spears, arrows,
shields, etc. As it happens, there is some evidence of warfare
between neighbouring mahājanapadas — how frequent or
how intense it was, of course, is impossible to tell. Such
military campaigns, but occasionally alliances too, gave
rise to new kingdoms and empires, which we will turn to
later in our journey.
Another innovation was the first use of coins in India,
made necessary by growing trade. Very soon, coins were
exchanged across different regions and even with other
parts of the world. The first Indian coins were made of

Chapter 4.indd 73

The age of the janapadas and mahājanapadas was an age of
profound change, which would impact Indian civilisation
until present times. In the chapter ‘India’s Cultural Roots’
in Grade 6, we saw the emergence of several new schools
of thought — late Vedic, Buddhist, Jain in particular, and
their respective literatures. Those schools disseminated
their teachings and literature through scholars, monks
and nuns travelling across India or people undertaking
pilgrimages. Indian art also underwent a renewal; it will
blossom in the age of empires.

silver, a soft metal into which symbols could be
‘punched’; they are called ‘punch-marked coins’.
Later, coins of copper, gold and other metals were
also made. Generally, a mahājanapada issued its
own coins, but coins from neighbouring regions
were used as well as exchanged in trade.

The Varṇa–Jāti System
We saw earlier how human societies grew more complex
with the rise of civilisation. Whenever this happens, a
society organises itself in several groups based on class,
occupation or some other criteria. For instance, there
could be different groups concerned with governance,
administration, religion, education, trade, town-planning,
farming, crafts, arts and all kinds of other professions.

Æ Why should a complex society divide itself into such
groups? Think about several possible factors why this
happens.
Æ List other such professions you expect in a complex
society of the 1st millennium BCE.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

In an ideal society, all those groups would complement each
other and work in harmony. But most of the time, these
divisions also lead to inequalities: some groups acquire
more wealth, power or influence than others. In other
words, while equality is an ideal that human societies have
often aspired to, very few, if any, have ever achieved it.
In India, the society was organised in a two-fold system.
One category was the jāti, a group or community of people
with a specific professional occupation closely tied to their
livelihood. The skills that defined a particular jāti — for
instance, skill in agriculture, metallurgy, commerce or
any craft — was generally transmitted from generation to
generation. Often, a jāti would get further subdivided into
sub-jātis, each of which developed customs and traditions
of its own, for instance concerning marriage, rituals or food
habits.
Along with the jāti, there is another category, that of varṇa,
a concept that emerged from Vedic texts. There were four
varṇas: Brahmins were engaged in preserving and spreading
knowledge, and in the performance of rituals; Kshatriyas
were expected to defend the society and the land, and to
engage in warfare if necessary; Vaishyas were supposed to
increase the society’s wealth through occupations of trade,
business or agriculture; finally, Shudras were the artisans,
craftspeople, workers or servants.

76

DON’T MISS OUT
You may have heard the English word ‘caste’. It comes from a
Portuguese word, casta, as Portuguese travellers to India in the
16th century CE tried to make sense of Indian society. While a
few scholars consider ‘caste’ to refer to varṇas, most take it to
apply to jātis; yet others consider ‘caste’ to refer to the whole
varṇa–jāti system.

The varṇa-jāti system has had a deep impact on Indian
society, and generations of scholars have studied its
countless aspects. There is a broad agreement that the
system was significantly different (more flexible, in
particular) in earlier periods and became more rigid with
the passage of time, in particular during the British rule
in India. Let us also keep in mind that while varṇa-jāti has
been an important mechanism at work in Indian society, it
is not the only one; there have been many others, some of
which we will explore later, especially in the theme ‘Our
Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions’.

Tapestry of the Past
4 – New Beginnings: Cities and States

There is historical evidence, both in texts and inscriptions,
that in the early period individuals and communities
changed their professional occupations if circumstances
demanded. For instance, a long drought or some natural
calamity could force a community of farmers to migrate
to a city and take up other occupations, or some Brahmins
would turn to trade or even military activities. This complex
system structured Indian society, organised its activities,
including economic ones, and therefore gave it some
stability. In time, however, the system became rigid and led
to inequalities and discrimination towards the lower jātis
or some communities excluded from the varṇa-jāti system.
This process will be studied in a higher grade.

Inequalities within society can exist in many forms. Have you
encountered any incident where you or anyone you know
might have been made to feel different from others? Do you
think equality is desirable in a society? If so, why? Have you
come across people or initiatives that lessened inequalities?

Developments Elsewhere in India

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

In this 1st millennium BCE, important communication
routes opened up for purposes of trade, pilgrimage, military
campaigns, etc. Two routes became widely used and are
often mentioned in the literature: the Uttarapatha and the
Dakṣhiṇapatha. The first connected the northwest regions
to the Ganga plains, all the way to eastern India; the second
started from Kauśhāmbī (near Prayagraj), then a capital of

one of the mahājanapadas, and crossed the Vindhya Range
of hills to proceed all the way south. We will return to these
routes when we explore the formation of empires in India.
Many lateral roads also connected with other parts of India,
especially the important ports on the western and eastern
coasts, which were vibrant centres of trade. In the eastern
region, major cities emerged, such as Śhiśhupalgarh (today
Sisupalgarh, part of Bhubaneswar), which was the capital
of the Kalinga region and followed a strict square ground
plan, with imposing fortifications and broad streets.
In the Subcontinent’s southern regions, cities began
emerging from about 400 BCE, although recent excavations
claim to find some signs of commercial activities
going further back. Around this time, three kingdoms
emerged — the Cholas, the Cheras and the Pānḍyas.

Apart from archaeological evidence, the most ancient
Tamil literature mentions those kingdoms and several of
their kings.
Because the southern regions are rich in resources such as
precious and semiprecious stones, gold, and spices, they
profitably traded not only with the rest of India but also
with kingdoms and empires overseas.
By 300 or 200 BCE, almost the entire Subcontinent, including
regions in the Northeast, was one vibrant interconnected
land; goods and culture travelled from region to region,
and often beyond India to parts of Central and Southeast
Asia.
About the same time, the mahājanapadas ceased to exist,
leaving the place to fresh developments that were going to
reshape India.

The 16 mahājanapadas were the first organised states
of the 1st millennium BCE; they witnessed the Second
Urbanisation of India, which spread in all directions from
the Ganga region, all the way to south India. By 300 BCE or
so, the mahājanapadas ceased to exist.

In the same period, a vast network of roads connected
north and south, east and west, and eventually all regions
of the Subcontinent. People, goods, ideas and teachings
travelled along all those roads.

Landing on the outskirts of the great city, a little dizzy, they saw a
girl talking to a person on horseback dressed in strange clothes.
As he left, she turned to them, and they asked her for her name.
“My name is Ira, daughter of Kanhadas, the ironsmith. Welcome
to Pāṭaliputra!”
“Glad to meet you, Ira. Our names are Bhavisha and Dhruv.”
“Sshh! Keep your voices down! Do you see those soldiers marching
past? They’re heading to battle against a neighbouring kingdom
that has been troubling us. Our king avoids war when he can, but
he also protects his people when needed. My father helped forge
many of the swords they carry, and my uncle is one of the soldiers
in the group. I just came to see him off… I don’t know when he’ll
return.”

“What kind of bridge is this?”
asked Bhavisha. “And is it a
river below?”
“This bridge keeps us safe,”

explained
Ira.
“It’s
lifted
whenever there is a danger of attack on the city. And no, it’s not
a river, it’s a moat; once the drawbridge is lifted, it makes it more
difficult to approach the fortifications. Can you see those hills and
forests in the distance? They provide us with timber, herbs, and
many other valuable resources. Elephants for the army are also
captured from the forest and trained for the army.”
“What is the opening in that hill?” asked Dhruv.
“It’s a cave. Our king is getting it carved out for a community of
monks. I hope we can visit it when it’s finished!”

08-04-2025 12:48:25

“You must visit our main market before you leave! Our king
welcomes travellers from all over, so you’ll get silk from China,
spices and gems from the south, fine clothes from different
regions—there’s nothing you won’t find in Pāṭaliputra!”
“What are those people over there doing?” asked Dhruv.
“Oh, these are street acrobats; they build human pyramids, sing
and dance, or act in short plays to entertain people. Sometimes,
they perform in front of the king!”
“Your king sounds very powerful,” remarked Bhavisha. “Does he
rule the region around Pāṭaliputra?”
“Much more than that!” answered Ira. “He rules over a vast land,
far, far beyond this city. His authority extends over many villages,
towns and kingdoms. My uncle told me that it takes close to two
months on horseback to reach the borders of the territory!”
“That sounds bigger than just a kingdom… What do you call it?”
“It is called an Empire,” Ira stated with evident pride.

What is an Empire?
The word ‘empire’ comes from the Latin ‘imperium’, which
means ‘supreme power’. Simply put, an empire is a collection
of smaller kingdoms or territories over which a powerful ruler
or group of rulers exert power, often after waging war against
the smaller kingdoms. The smaller territories still had their own
rulers, but they were all tributaries to the emperor, who ruled
the whole territory from a capital, usually a major centre of
economic and administrative power.
In ancient Sanskrit texts, words commonly used for ‘emperor’
made this clear; they included samrāj, meaning ‘the lord of all’
or ‘supreme ruler’; adhirāja or ‘overlord’; and rājādhirāja or
‘king of kings’.

Tributary:
A tributary,
in our case,
is a ruler
or a state
that has
submitted to
an emperor
and pays
tribute—
that is,
money, gold
(or other
precious
metals),
grain,
livestock,
elephants
or other
valuable
goods
produced
in their
kingdom and
is given to
the emperor
as a sign of
submission,
loyalty or
respect. A
synonym for
‘tributary’ is
‘vassal’, and
another way
to express
this is to
say that the
tributary
or vassal
kingdoms
accepted the
emperor’s
overlordship.

for a while, declined, and disappeared. In fact, the last empire
that ruled the Subcontinent existed less than a century ago! But
now is not the time to tell that story; we start at the other end
of time, so we may understand how empires functioned in the
distant past and how they deeply impacted India’s evolution at
all levels — political, economic, social, and cultural.

Looking at the many challenges involved in managing
an empire, why should a king be so keen to expand his
kingdom into an empire and become an emperor? Here
are a few possible answers; see if you can think of a few
more:
 An ambition to ‘rule the entire world’, a metaphor
for controlling large territories and ensuring that
they would be remembered for posterity;


A wish to bring large areas under control and gain
access to their resources to build economic and
military strength;



A desire for great wealth for himself and for the
empire.

LET’S EXPLORE
Warfare apart, what other methods do you think the rulers
might have used to expand their empires? Pen your ideas and
share them with your class.

Trade, trade routes and guilds
Conducting military campaigns, especially in distant lands, is
not as simple as it might seem. Maintaining an army is a costly
affair: soldiers need to be fed, clothed, equipped with weapons,
and paid; elephants and horses need to be cared for; roads or
ships have to be built, and so on. All this requires considerable
economic power, control over the workforce, and access
to resources.

Returning to the case of ancient India, what would have been the
traded goods? There is plenty of evidence on this, at least, both
from the literature and archaeological excavations — textiles,
spices, agricultural produce, luxury items such as gems and
handicraft products, and various animals were among the main
items of trade. All this brisk trade was not limited to India; many
Indian goods travelled towards distant countries by land or sea.
More often than not, traders were not just isolated individuals
carrying out their own business. They soon understood
the benefits of joining forces and creating guilds (śhrenīs).
Guilds were powerful associations of traders, craftsmen,
moneylenders or agriculturists. As far as evidence shows,
a guild had a head (who was usually elected) and executive

We can now understand that economic activity — especially
production and trade — is one of the keys to maintaining an
empire and ensuring people’s welfare and quality of life, which
a good ruler should be concerned with. Therefore, establishing
and controlling trade routes all over the empire’s territory
and beyond is of great importance. That way, the goods traded
will grow in quantity and variety, and more trade means more
income for the producers and increased tax collections for
the ruler.

and information on markets, supply and demand, workforce,
etc., was to everyone’s benefit. Second, as an ancient text put
it, “Cultivators, traders, herdsmen, moneylenders, and artisans
have authority to lay down rules for their respective classes”;
in other words, guilds had the autonomy to create their own
internal rules, and the king was not to interfere with them (and
why should he, if trade flourished?).
Guilds spread over large parts of India and endured for centuries.
Even after they ceased to exist formally, their spirit continued
to influence India’s trade and business activities, sometimes
even to this day. The institution of guilds provides an excellent
example of the self-organising abilities of Indian society. The
ancient village unit, with its various committees and councils,
provides another. Indeed, an enlightened ruler would let people
organise themselves and refrain from interfering if the local
institutions worked satisfactorily.

The period between the 6th and the 4th century BCE was
one of profound change in north India. We briefly visited the
sixteen mahājanapadas earlier — those large kingdoms of north
and central India with their assembly system. One of them,
Magadha (modern-day south Bihar and some adjoining areas),
rose in importance and set the stage for the fusion of many
kingdoms into India’s first empire. Powerful early kings, such as
Ajātaśhatru, played a crucial role in establishing Magadha as a
dominant centre of power.

Magadha was located in the resource-rich Ganga plains, with
fertile land, abundant forests for timber, and elephants. Also,
remember how the use of iron transformed other technologies,
such as agriculture and warfare. Iron ore and other minerals
from the nearby hilly regions proved crucial for the expansion
of the kingdom. The use of iron ploughs to till the land increased
agricultural produce, and lighter and sharper iron weapons
strengthened the capabilities of the army.

Around the 5th century BCE, Mahāpadma Nanda rose to
prominence in Magadha and founded the Nanda dynasty. He
successfully unified many smaller kingdoms and extended
his empire across parts of eastern and northern India. As the
economy thrived, he began issuing coins, demonstrating his
economic power. We also learn from Greek accounts that the
Nanda dynasty maintained a large army.

king, Porus.

Alexander, a young and powerful Greek
king from Macedonia, campaigned
against the Persian Empire to avenge
earlier Persian invasions of Greece
(during which some Indian soldiers
from the Persian-ruled northwest of
India fought against Greeks!). Alexander
conquered the Persian Empire; the
influence of Greek culture spread. His
empire now spread over three continents,
one of the largest in world history.

The satraps were governors of provinces of Persian and
Greek empires who were left behind by the overlord (like
Alexander) to manage the far-off territories. These satraps
had significant power and freedom despite being mere
officials of the rulers. Can you guess how it was possible for
them to exercise such power?

THINK ABOUT IT
Why do you think Alexander wanted to rule over the entire
world? What would he have gained from it?

LET’S EXPLORE
When, after the battle, Alexander asked Porus how he wished
to be treated, Porus answered, “Like a King.” Alexander then
left Porus at the head of his kingdom, as satrap. With the help
of your teachers, find more details on the battle between Porus
and Alexander. Enact a play of this battle scene using your
imagination in addition to what you have discovered.

Back in Persia, Alexander faced rebellions and
political turmoil. After he fell ill and died in
Babylon at the age of 32, his immense empire
was soon divided between his generals and the
satraps, who created their own kingdoms.

Eager to reach the “end of the world”, Alexander pushed on
further east and brought his campaign to India, defeated Porus in
Punjab and, encountering fierce resistance from local tribes and
rulers, massacred the population of several cities. Greek records
mention that in a few battles, “women fought side by side with
their men.” Alexander himself was seriously wounded in a battle.
Tired and homesick, his soldiers lost the will to fight and refused
to move deeper into India, towards the Ganga River. Alexander
and part of his army retreated to Persia, but through the coastal
route in the south and Iran’s harsh desert regions, resulting in
heavy losses to his troops out of thirst, hunger and disease.

Alexander’s dialogue with the Gymnosophists

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

Alexander heard of a group of Indian sages whom the Greeks
called ‘Gymnosophists’ or ‘naked philosophers’ (probably
because they wore very little clothing), who were renowned for
their wisdom. Alexander challenged them with tricky questions
in the form of riddles, warning that he would put those who
gave wrong answers to death. However, the Gymnosophists
responded to his questions calmly and intelligently. Alexander
was impressed and, in the end, spared them all. Over the
centuries, different versions of this story have been told, making
it one of the most fascinating encounters in history!

98

Chapter 5.indd 98

Fig. 5.11. A Greek coin
probably showing
Alexander on horseback
attacking Porus on his
elephant.

According to one account, Alexander
asked, “Which is stronger, life or
death?” One of the sages replied, “Life,
because it endures while death does
not.” Alexander then asked, “How can
a man be most loved?” “If he is most
powerful and yet does not inspire
fear,” came the reply, perhaps as a
hint to the mighty ruler!
Historians view such exchanges as
a meeting of two great traditions —
Greek and Indian philosophies.

The Mighty Mauryas
After that brief sojourn to the northwest, let us return to
Magadha, where we witnessed the decline of the Nanda
empire. Around 321 BCE, just a few years after Alexander
left India with his army, a new dynasty and new empire
emerged: the Maurya Empire founded by Chandragupta
Maurya. It quickly absorbed the Nanda empire’s territories
and went on expanding beyond.
As per many accounts, Chandragupta managed this feat with the
help of an able mentor named Kauṭilya, who used his knowledge
of politics, governance and economics to create an empire that
remains one of the greatest in Indian history.

08-04-2025 12:48:39

The story of Kauṭilya
According to Buddhist texts, Kauṭilya—sometimes referred to as
Chāṇakya or Viṣhnugupta—was a teacher at the world-renowned
Takṣhaśhila (modern-day Taxila) university. His legendary tale
begins in the court of Dhana Nanda, who as we saw, had become
highly unpopular.

Observing this, Kauṭilya advised Dhana Nanda to change his
ways or witness the collapse of his empire. Angered, Dhana
Nanda insulted Kauṭilya and threw him out of his court. This led
to Kauṭilya’s vow to end the ‘evil Nanda’ rule.

The rise of Chandragupta Maurya
There are many stories about the origin and adventures of
Chandragupta Maurya, but their common theme is that he

08-04-2025 12:48:40

Fig. 5.14. Megasthenes in the court of Chandragupta Maurya
(A 20th-century painting by Asit Kumar Haldar)

overthrew the Nandas and took control of Magadha to establish
his rule, with Pāṭaliputra as his capital. Do you remember that
Magadha had many advantages because of its geography, an
established economic system and a flourishing trade? These,
combined with the advice of the master strategist, Kauṭilya,
helped Chandragupta Maurya gradually expand his empire.

After Chandragupta Maurya defeated the Greeks, he maintained
a diplomatic relationship with them and hosted in his court a
Greek historian and diplomat, Megasthenes, who wrote about
his travels in India in his book Indika — the first such written
account — unfortunately lost except for some excerpts quoted
by later Greek scholars.

Kauṭilya’s concept of a kingdom
Kauṭilya had a clear vision of how a kingdom (rājya) should
be established, managed and consolidated. In his famous
work Arthaśhāstra (literally, ‘the science of governance and
economics’), he listed directives in many areas like defence,

Chapter 5.indd 101

economics, administration, justice, urban planning, agriculture
and people’s welfare. One of his most important political concepts
is the saptānga (see fig 5.15) or the seven parts that constitute
a kingdom.
According to Kauṭilya, the saptānga together must create
a settled, well-protected, and prosperous kingdom to be
maintained both through warfare and through alliances for
peace, as the case may be. He emphasised the importance
of law and order in society, which necessitated a strong
administration. He also detailed many laws to deal with
corruption and specified punishments for any activities that
went against the wellbeing of the people.



Kauṭilya says, “A king shall increase his power by
promoting the welfare of his people, for power comes
from the countryside which is the source of all economic
activity. [The king] shall show special favours to those in
the countryside who do things which benefit the people,
such as building embankments or road bridges, beautifying
villages, or helping to protect them.”



Why do you think it was important to take special care of
the countryside? (Hint: Think back to what you have learnt
at the beginning of this chapter)

Kauṭilya’s central philosophy of governance is in tune with
Indian values: “In the happiness of his subjects lies the king’s
happiness; in their welfare his welfare. He shall not consider
as good only that which pleases him but treat as beneficial
to him whatever pleases his subjects.” In other words,
however powerful a king may be, he must give first place to the
people’s interests.

Another king of the Maurya
dynasty was Aśhoka (268–
232 BCE), Chandragupta’s
grandson, who came to
be credited with major
administrative and religious
achievements.
At the beginning of his
reign, Aśhoka was quite
ambitious. He had inherited
a vast empire but further
expanded it to cover almost
the entirety of the Indian
subcontinent, except for
the southernmost region,

path of peace and non-violence that the Buddha taught.

Aśhoka, in his edicts, tells the story of the Kalinga war. He
could have chosen not to mention it and maintain his image
as a peaceful, benevolent king for future generations. Why
do you think he admitted to this destructive war?
Embracing Buddhist teachings, Aśhoka sent emissaries to
Sri Lanka, Thailand, Central Asia and beyond to spread the
message of the Buddha far and wide.

104

Chapter 5.indd 104

08-04-2025 12:48:45

Historians have sometimes called Aśhoka
a ‘great communicator’ since he issued in
many parts of his empire edicts engraved on
rocks or pillars that contained his messages
for the people and encouraged them to
follow dharma. Most of these edicts were
inscribed in Prakrit, which was the popular
language in many parts of India and written
in the Brahmi script (Brahmi is the mother
of all regional scripts of India).

We have referred to the
Prakrit language written in
Brahmi script. What does
this mean? Very simply, a
language is what we speak,
while script is what we write
a language in. Can you think
of examples of this in our
everyday life?

In his edicts, Aśhoka called himself ‘Devanampiya Piyadasi’;
the first word means ‘Beloved of the Gods’; the second, ‘one
who regards others with kindness’. And indeed, the language
of the edicts makes it clear that he was interested in depicting
himself as a benevolent and compassionate ruler. Let us see a
few examples of this.

Although some southern kingdoms were not part of the Mauryan
kingdom, Aśhoka supported their overall wellbeing. He claimed
to provide medical care for people and animals even beyond his

empire, prohibited hunting and cruelty to animals, and ordered
medical treatment for them when necessary. If so, Aśhoka
was an early contributor to nature conservation and wildlife
preservation. He said he had established rest houses and wells
at regular intervals along the main roads of his empire and got
fruit and shade trees planted. He also claimed to encourage all
sects (the different schools of thought present in his time) to
accept each other’s best teachings and study them.
Although we need not take all of Aśhoka’s claims literally, it is
clear that in line with Kauṭilya’s philosophy of governance, he
paid attention to the welfare of his subjects and made efforts to
reach out to them.

You read about the word ‘dharma’ (dhamma in Prakrit) in
Grade 6. Its essence cannot be easily captured. In simple
terms, dharma means moral law or someone’s religious or
ethical duties towards family, community or country. At a
deeper level, however, dharma extends to living according
to the order of the universe or ṛitam. This includes doing
one’s duty truthfully, following rules of righteous conduct
and leading a life in harmony with the cosmic order.
Dharma is, therefore, duty, law, truth, order and ethics — all
of it together!

LET’S EXPLORE
Aśhoka details instructions on the conduct of his officials and
mentions ways to ensure that they practised fairness in one of
his edicts. Read the translation below and share your thoughts
on whether those ways would have been successful in helping
manage his empire and how.

[…] You are in charge of many thousands of living beings. You
should gain the affection of men. All men are my children,
and just as I desire for my children that they should obtain
welfare and happiness both in this world and the next, the
same do I desire for all men. […] You should strive to practice
impartiality. […] The root of all this is to be even-tempered
and not rash in your work. […] This inscription has been
engraved here in order that the city magistrates should at
all times see to it that men are never imprisoned or tortured
without good reason. […] And for this purpose, I shall send
out on tour every five years, an officer who is not severe or
harsh; who, having investigated this matter..., shall see that
they carry out my instructions.”

The Maurya empire continued for half a century after Aśhoka’s
death. However, his successors were unable to hold the empire
together, and many of the smaller kingdoms broke off and
became independent. Around 185 BCE, India started on another
phase of her journey. Bhavisha and Dhruv will join us on this
journey in the next chapter.

Life in the Mauryan period
Cities like Pāṭaliputra were bustling centres of governance and
commerce. They had palaces, public buildings, and well-planned
streets. With a well-organised taxation system and brisk trade,
the treasury remained strong, fuelling the empire’s growth
and prosperity. Officials of the administration of the empire,
merchants and artisans played key roles in the city life.

The Sohagaura copper
plate inscription, dating
back to the 4th–3rd
century BCE, is one of
India’s earliest known
administrative
records.
Discovered in Sohgaura,
Uttar Pradesh, it is written
Fig. 5.19
in Prakrit using the Brahmi script and is believed to have
been issued during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya. The
inscription mentions the establishment of a granary to store
grain as a precaution against famines, highlighting the state’s
efforts to ensure food security and support its people during
times of crisis.
Megasthenes’ account also throws some light on the society
of that time. A substantial proportion of the population was
engaged in agriculture, which was an important source of
revenue for the empire. Two crops were sown in a year, as rain
fell in both summer and winter. This ensured that famines were

08-04-2025 12:48:47

rare and people had ample food. Granaries were well stocked
for any eventualities. Even if war raged nearby, farmers were
protected from it, and agriculture was not disturbed.
Blacksmiths, potters, carpenters, jewellers and other artisans
lived in the cities. The cities were well-planned and had signage
on the streets. Communication happened through couriers who
carried messages from place to place. The houses were made of
wood and could be up to two storeys tall. The streets had vessels
of water stored at regular intervals in case of fire.
Later accounts describe the cotton dresses people wore — a
lower garment that reached below the knee halfway down to
the ankles and an upper garment that they threw over their
shoulders. Some wore leather shoes with designs and thick soles
to make them look taller.

This image may be familiar to some of you. Indeed, this
capital was chosen as India’s national emblem, to which was
added the Sanskrit motto satyameva jayate or “truth alone
triumphs” (see the national emblem on the left). Besides,
the dharmachakra is depicted at the centre of our national
flag, as you may also have noticed. The motto comes from
the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣhad; in full, it reads satyameva jayate
nānṛitam, that is, “truth alone triumphs, not falsehood”.

DON’T MISS OUT
The big, round hemispherical structure in the centre of the
stūpa is called the aṇḍa. It represents the universe and is often
built to house sacred relics. People walk around it in a circle
as a form of worship (pradakṣhiṇa).

The Fragile Nature of Empires
You will hear in higher grades about past mighty empires
elsewhere in the world, such as the Roman, the Persian, the
Ottoman, the Spanish, the Russian, the British empires, and so
on. All of them are long gone, but historians keep debating the
causes of their decline.

112

Chapter 5.indd 112

08-04-2025 12:48:51

One of those causes, as we saw, is the temptation for some of
the empire’s regions to try and become independent. This could
happen if, for example, the emperor needed more resources
for long military campaigns or in times of drought; local rulers
would be burdened with increasing demands for tribute,
leading to resentment. Or if a powerful emperor was followed
by one perceived to be weak, local kings or chieftains might
simply decide to take a chance and stop paying tribute. Also, the
larger an empire, the more difficult it is to hold it together, as
Alexander experienced; far-off territories are often the first to
split away from the empire. Finally, economic crises caused by
natural calamities (such as a long drought or floods) could also
shake an empire’s structure.
Empires are, therefore, something of a paradox. On the one hand,
they can bring about political unity, as the Mauryan empire
did to almost the entire Subcontinent, and reduce or eliminate
warfare among the smaller kingdoms — indeed, a well-managed
empire could lead to greater prosperity than smaller, warring
kingdoms. On the other hand, empires have almost always been
established through war and have maintained their existence

Before we move on …
Æ

An empire is a large territory made up of many smaller
kingdoms or territories. Emperors expanded their kingdoms
mostly to gain fame, amass power, including military power,
and control resources and economic life.

Æ

The first empires of India emerged in regions blessed
with abundant natural resources, rivers for irrigation and
transport, and the production of a variety of goods for trade.

Æ

Alexander’s campaign in northwest India had a limited
political impact but opened the door for Indo-Greek cultural
contacts.

Æ

The Mauryas created a vast empire with a legacy that lasted
centuries. Their legacy includes strengthening trade routes
and economic systems, extensive use of coins for trade,
well-designed urban settlements, and an elaborate system
of administration. They also promoted art and architecture.

Æ

Aśhoka was keen to advertise his achievements and project
the image of a benevolent ruler who encouraged his subjects
to follow dharma.

Bhavisha and Dhruv had recovered from their journey to
the Maurya empire and were itching for another adventure.
They decide to use Itihāsa again and landed in a new
historical period. They came across a collection of art pieces,
each one quite different from the other. (See Fig. 6.1.1) They
wondered —could these artefacts belong to multiple
kingdoms rather than just one? They guessed right. In this
chapter we will travel over a fairly long period. Here we go…

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

Very little is known about Aśhoka’s
successors to the throne. It is generally
accepted, however, that the last
Maurya emperor was assassinated
around 185 BCE by his commanderin-chief Puṣhyamitra Śhunga. This led
to a breakup of the empire — hardly
half a century after Aśhoka, as we
mentioned in the last chapter. Many
new kingdoms emerged across the
subcontinent, which, often, were
Fig. 6.1.2.
earlier tributary kingdoms under the
overlordship of the Maurya empire. The northwest region
became weak, exposing it to invasions from outside the
subcontinent.
This period is also known as the ‘age of reorganisation’ by
some scholars as the existing regions were being reorganised
into new kingdoms that were constantly competing to become
powerful. The map of India changed significantly in that age, as
did people’s lives.

LET’S EXPLORE
Create a timeline on a sheet of paper marking the period
from the first year of the 2nd century BCE and ending in the
last year of the 3rd century CE. How many years does this
period cover? As we progress through the chapter, mark the
key individuals, kingdoms and events on the timeline.

alliance : An

through a
marriage,
generally
between two
members of

In practice, this
would often
mean a king

marriage into the
royal family of
a neighbouring
kingdom, with
the intention
of cementing
an alliance
between the two
kingdoms.

LET’S EXPLORE
In the previous chapter, you studied the map of the Maurya
empire (see page 100). Above is a map of the post-Maurya
period. How many kingdoms can you count in the area that
were previously under the control of the Maurya empire?
The ‘new’ kingdoms now competed for territorial control.
Peaceful methods like matrimonial alliances between neighbouring kingdoms, or the use of force in warfare, were means of
gaining control. Remember that there was constant wrestling
for control over areas along the borders, as gaining control over
them was important to keep the kingdom safe from attacks.
Together with those political events, there was a burst in the
development of art, architecture and literature, and enriching
cultural exchanges. We will get a peek into this in the following
sections.

Surge of the Śhungas
Puṣhyamitra Śhunga founded the Śhunga dynasty, which
ruled over parts of north and central India. He performed
the aśhvamedha yajña, a Vedic ritual, to establish himself as a
most powerful ruler. Although his empire was smaller than the
previous Maurya Empire (compare their two maps), he kept it
safe from potential invaders and maintained friendly relations
with the Greeks, after some initial military campaign against
them. But, again, the empire did not last long after him — a
century later, it was gone.
The period witnessed the revival of Vedic rituals and practices,
but other schools of thought nevertheless continued to flourish.

Fig. 6.4. Scene from the Rāmāyaṇa in which King Rāma is seen performing
the aśhvamedha yajña (19th century painting, National Museum)

The aśhvamedha yajña was a Vedic ritual conducted by
many rulers to declare their position as the king. In this
ritual, a horse accompanied by soldiers was left to wander
freely. Any territory that the horse crossed unchallenged
was considered to become a part of the king’s empire. If
any ruler stopped the horse, it led to a battle to determine
supremacy.

philosophical and literary works. Do you recall some aspects
of the Yoga Sūtras in your Physical Education and Well-being

The Śhungas patronised literature, art and architecture. The
Bharhut Stūpa (in present-day Madhya Pradesh) presents us
with beautiful examples of Śhunga art. It was probably built
during the time of Ashoka, but the Śhungas added beautifully
carved railings and reliefs depicting stories from the Buddha’s
life. These are considered some of the earliest examples of
Buddhist art.

the clothes, the jewellery, and other objects of daily use.

The Sātavāhanas
From the limited evidence available, the Śhungas seem to have
waged wars with many of their neighbouring regions. This
may have included the Sātavāhanas, who ruled large parts of
the Deccan from the 2nd century BCE onward, to the south of
the Śhunga Empire. Sometimes referred to as ‘Andhras’, the
Sātavāhanas were a powerful dynasty and their empire largely
comprised of present-day Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and
Maharashtra, with different capital cities at different times — the
most famous were Amrāvatī and Pratiṣhṭhāna (Paithan). Trade
and commerce appear to have flourished in the Sātavāhana
kingdom.

08-04-2025 11:38:33

Coins issued by the Sātavāhana rulers
have been found in various regions
of India, from Gujarat to Andhra
Pradesh — India’s western and eastern
coasts. Indeed, many coins depicted
ships, suggesting that maritime trade
was an important part of economic life.
The type of ship depicted on the coin
above suggests advanced shipbuilding
and navigation technologies.

networks that reached as far as the
Roman Empire and included an exchange of goods like spices,
textiles, sandalwood, and luxury items like gold-plated pearls,
ivory, etc. Imports included glass and perfumed ointments. Tolls
and taxes on trade added revenue to the kingdom.

Tapestry of the Past

Economic prosperity and a relatively peaceful political period
facilitated the development of literature, art and culture, to
which the Sātavāhanas made significant contributions.

used for collection of tolls and taxes, and as resting places for traders.

Life under the Sātavāhanas
In the Sātavāhana tradition, princes were
often named after their mothers. Thus
Gautamīputra Sātakarṇi was named
after his mother, Gautamī Balaśhrī. She
was a powerful queen who donated
land to Buddhist monks and had an
important inscription carved in Nāśhik,
showing her influence in the kingdom.

Fig. 6.10. Coin of the Sātavāhanas with
an inscription in Brahmi script, ‘King
Lord Sātakarṇi, son of Gautamī’.

THINK ABOUT IT
What, according to you, could the tradition of using the
mother’s name at the beginning of a king’s name signify?

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

Another set of inscriptions found in the Naneghat caves near
Pune (Fig. 6.9) focuses on a Sātavāhana widow queen who,
remarkably, performed several Vedic rituals, including the
aśhvamedha yajña. The inscriptions mention Vedic gods like
Indra, Chandra, and Sūrya. We also get a glimpse of the queen’s
donations (dāna): land, cows, horses, elephants, silver coins, and
other items to priests, guests, workers, scholars, and monks.
These inscriptions are in the Brahmi script and include a
few numerals (that is, symbols for numbers) which, at times,
resemble today’s shapes, as shown below. This is one of the many
evidences showing that modern numerals ultimately originated
in India.

The Sātavāhanas were devout followers of Vāsudeva (another
name for Kṛiṣhṇa), although they also patronised other schools
of thought, which flourished during their rule. For instance,
Sātavāhana kings often granted tax-free agricultural land to
Vedic scholars, Jaina and Buddhist monks, helping them to
pursue their studies and practices.

Fig. 6.11. The Karla caves (near Lonavala
in present-day Maharashtra) to which the
Sātavāhanas contributed during their reign.
These caves were made for Buddhist monks.
Notice the magnificent pillars and the stone
replica of a stūpa in the centre — all of
it carved out of a rocky hillside!

Fig. 6.12. A yakṣha (a minor deity
associated with nature) from the
Pitalkhora caves, Maharashtra, carved
in the Sātavāhana period.

This sculpture of a yakṣha from Pitalkhora carries an
inscription on its hand, kanhadāsena hiramakarena kāṭa
meaning ‘made by Kanahadasa, a goldsmith’. Is it not
interesting to see that a goldsmith could also craft a sculpture
made of stone? What do you think this tells us about people’s
professions at the time?
In the 3rd century CE, the Sātavāhana Empire fragmented into
smaller independent kingdoms. Several factors contributed to
its disintegration, the most significant one being weak central

control and a gradual economic decline. Once again, this will
pave the way for regional powers to assert or reassert their
dominance and establish new kingdoms.

Coming of the Chedis
Let us go back a little. Do you remember the Kalinga war
mentioned in the previous chapter? After the decline of the
Maurya Empire, Kalinga rose as a prominent power under the
kings of the Chedi dynasty.
Khāravela, one of their main rulers, was a devoted follower
of Jain teachings; he was sometimes called bhikṣhu-rāja or
monk-king, although he respected all schools of thoughts. Near
Bhubaneswar, the famous Udayagiri-Khandagiri caves, likely
developed for Jain monks, feature intricate panels and statues,
and spacious rooms carved into the rock, showcasing the skill
of the craftsmen. The design and craftsmanship of these caves
make them notable examples of ‘rock-cut architecture’, a style of
architecture that we will turn to in higher classes.

08-04-2025 11:38:35

One of the caves prominently displays the Hāthīgumphā
inscription, written in Brahmi script, which records King
Khāravela’s accomplishments year after year, including his
victorious military campaigns and his benevolent works for the
welfare of his people. Khāravela also proudly declares that he
created a ‘council of ascetics and sages’ from a hundred regions
and is ‘accomplished in extraordinary virtues, respector of every
sect and repairer of every temple’. Once again, a ruler takes
pride in extending his protection to all schools of thought. This
is a fundamental part of what we may call the ‘Indian ethos’.

THINK ABOUT IT
Notice the regularity of the rock-cut chambers sculpted
nearly two millennia ago. How did artisans achieve such
precision with just a chisel and a hammer? Picture yourself
as a sculptor in that era, shaping stone into art with your own
hands. What tools would you use?

In India’s southern region, this period, between the 2nd or 3rd
century BCE and the 3rd century CE, saw the rise to prominence
of three powerful kingdoms — the Cheras, the Cholas and the
Pānḍyas — which often competed with each other for control
over the South, while also contributing to the region’s growth
in trade and culture. Let’s remember how Aśhoka’s empire
stopped at those south Indian kingdoms (which he mentions in
his edicts), which suggests that they remained independent even
at the height of Mauryan power. And although Khāravela claims
that he defeated an alliance of south Indian kings that threatened
his own territory, the location of that battle is unknown and he
does not seem to have invaded the southern region.

THINK ABOUT IT
In the map given on next page, you may notice different
symbols alongside the names of the kingdoms. What do
these symbols represent? Think about how they highlight the
unique identities of the kingdoms.

That period saw the advent of many poets whose works,
collectively known as ‘Sangam literature’, defined the entire
era: it came to be known as the ‘Sangam Age’. The word sangam
is derived from the Sanskrit sangha, which translates to
‘association’ and ‘coming together’ — in this context, referring
to an assembly of the poets. The Sangam literature, the oldest
in south India, consists of several collections or anthologies of
poems and is much consulted by historians who investigate
the society and culture of the times. Primarily, Sangam poetry
expresses with great skill and delicacy personal emotions such
as love or societal values like heroism and generosity.

The Cholas
The Sangams refer to three ‘crowned kings’ — the Cholas, Cheras
and Pānḍyas. The Cholas were a powerful dynasty that ruled
parts of south India from the 3rd century BCE to the 13th century
CE. The Chola king Karikāla is said to have defeated a combined
force of the Cheras and Pānḍyas and established his supremacy.

Silappadikāram: The Tale of the Anklet

Fig. 6.15. Statue of Kaṇṇagi, Chennai

To start anew, Kaṇṇagi gave Kovalan one of her anklets to sell;
however, he was falsely accused of theft and executed by the
Pānḍya king. Devastated, Kaṇṇagi proved his innocence by
revealing her second anklet. The king, realising his mistake,
died of shock. Kaṇṇagi then cursed Madurai, invoking the god
of fire who destroyed the city. She then walked further west to
the Chera kingdom, where she was honoured as a goddess. Even
today, Kaṇṇagi is worshipped in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
Silappadikāram’s exquisite poetry thus centres on the principles
of justice and the ruler’s dharma to protect it. It also takes us
through cities rich in traded goods, through three kingdoms,
and also through several schools of thought.

Karikāla undertook many projects for the benefit of the people.
Among them is the Kallaṇai or Grand Anicut, a complex water
diversion system located at a geographically strategic point
just downstream of the Srirangam island. It helped to divert
waters from the Kāveri to the central and southern parts of
the Kāveri delta. This enabled more land to be brought under
cultivation, earning this area the name ‘rice bowl of the South’.
Restored several times in the course of time, it is still in use and
helps millions of people in Tamil Nadu by providing water for
irrigation and thus supporting agriculture in the region.

The Cheras
Also known as the Keralaputra (sons of Kerala), the Cheras
ruled over the western parts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, with
their capital at Vanji, present-day Karur in Tamil Nadu. They
played an essential role in shaping the region’s cultural and
economic history, encouraging the growth of Tamil literature
and patronising Sangam poets.
The Cheras were known for their extensive trade connections
with the Roman Empire and West Asia, exporting many goods
from India to the outside world. The kingdom became a hub for
the export of spices, timber, ivory and pearls.

THINK ABOUT IT
Have you ever wondered how historians uncover the trade
relations between two distant kingdoms many centuries
ago? Let’s take a moment to brainstorm and discuss how this
information comes to light.
The Chera kings issued a number
of coins under their reign. Do you
notice the royal emblem of Cheras
on one such coin given below?
Fig. 6.18. Coins under Chera Kings

The Pānḍyas’ rule over parts of Tamil Nadu and the surrounding
regions, with their capital at present-day Madurai, goes back
several centuries BCE. Successive kings expanded the Pāndyan
kingdom. In his work Indika, Megasthenes mentions this
kingdom as a prosperous one, with a strong administration and
involved in active trade with distant powers like the Greeks
and Romans, apart from much internal trade (Khāravela, for
instance, states that he gets hundreds of pearls brought from the
Pānḍya kingdom). The Pānḍyas were also an important naval
power of the subcontinent. The later Pānḍyas also contributed
greatly to the art, architecture, and overall prosperity of the
region.

THINK ABOUT IT
The Pānḍyas were known for their pearls. Why do you think
pearls were an important article of trade during these times?
The Pānḍyas left many inscriptions in which their kings
asserted their great concern for their subjects’ welfare and their
encouragements to all schools of thought and belief.

Invasions of the Indo-Greeks

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

Having completed our brief journey
into south India, it is time to return
to the north, where a very different
kind of development is about to
occur. So far, we have only visited
a few native dynasties; yet the same
period also witnessed the arrival of
invaders who entered through the
northwest frontier and took control
of the northwestern, northern, and
central regions of the Subcontinent.

134

Chapter 6.indd 134

Let us first examine the legacy of
Alexander’s brief campaign in the
Indus plains. While retreating from
Fig. 6.19. The Heliodorus pillar near Vidisha the areas he had conquered, he left
satraps behind. Over time, these
regional rulers established their independent domains and
came to be known as ‘Indo-Greeks’.
After the decline of the Mauryas, the areas in the northwestern
regions (roughly present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan) were
an easy target for the Indo-Greeks. However, while they arrived
as conquerors, they were much influenced by the rich local
culture. This cultural interaction led to a blend of Greek and
Indian elements in governance, art, language, and daily life,
shaping the cultural landscape of the region.
The Heliodorus pillar, near Vidisha (Madhya Pradesh), is a
notable example of such connections. It is named after an Indo-

08-04-2025 11:38:39

Greek ambassador, who in his inscription praises Vāsudeva as
the ‘god of gods’. The inscription also states, “Three immortal
precepts (footsteps) [...] when practised lead to heaven: selfrestraint, charity, consciousness.”
During excavations in north India, archaeologists have found
many Indo-Greeks coins, which have provided most of the
information we have about these rulers. Those coins were made
of gold, silver, copper and nickel often portraying a king on one
side and Greek deities on the other. However, some coins, instead,
depicted Indian deities like Vāsudeva-Kṛiṣhṇa and Lakṣhmī.
The rule of the Indo-Greeks ended with the invasions of the
Indo-Scythians or Śhakas (see a little below).

LET’S EXPLORE
What do you think might have
been the meaning of having
deities like Vāsudeva-Kṛiṣhṇa
or Lakṣhmī on some Indo-Greek
coins?

Fig. 6.20. An Indo-Greek silver coin

The Śhakas (sometimes
called Indo-Scythians) also
invaded the northwest of
the Subcontinent and ruled
from the latter part of the
2nd century BCE to the 5th
century CE. Their kingdoms

was during this period that the Śhaka Samvat calendar was
developed. It is 78 years behind the Gregorian calendar
(except from January–March, when it is behind by 79 years).
It was adopted as the Indian National Calendar in 1957.

The Emergence of the Kuṣhāṇas
The Kuṣhāṇas, originally from central Asia, entered India
probably in the 2nd century CE. At its peak, their empire extended
from central Asia to large parts of northern India. Their rule
marked a period of extensive cultural intermixing and had a
profound impact on the history of the Indian subcontinent.
When he was not busy with his military campaigns, Kaṇiṣhka
encouraged art and culture, leading to the development of new
artistic styles.

LET’S EXPLORE
Carefully observe this massive statue (1.85 m
high) and notice the clothing, weapon, and
footwear. What does it tell us about this
figure?

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

Fig. 6.22. Headless statue
of King Kaṇiṣhka

This famous ‘headless’ statue is of King Kaṇiṣhka,
probably the most powerful ruler of the Kuṣhāṇa
dynasty. The Brahmi inscription on the statue
reads, ‘mahārāja rājadhirāja devaputra kaṇiṣhka’,
that is, ‘The great king, king of kings, son of God,
Kaṇiṣhka’.

LET’S EXPLORE
Observe the coins carefully. Who, besides the emperor,
appears on the coin?

Fig. 6.23. Coins of Kaṇiṣhka

136

Chapter 6.indd 136

08-04-2025 11:38:43

On the first coin, Kāṇiṣhka is shown holding a spear, titled
‘King of Kings’, while the other side features Buddha with the
inscription BOΔΔO (Buddha) in Greek script. On the second coin,
an emperor appears on one side, and Śhiva with the bull Nandi
on the other. Let’s reflect on the following:



Why would a powerful ruler feature Buddha and Śhiva on
his coins? What does it say about his values and priorities?



Can you find modern examples of such symbolic currency?

The Kuṣhāṇas held control over significant sections of the Silk
Route (on the next page), and during their reign, trade grew,
connecting India with other parts of Asia and the West.

The Gāndhāra style, which emerged in the
western regions of Punjab, blended GrecoRoman elements with Indian features. Most
sculptures and artefacts from this tradition
were crafted in intricate detail from greyblack schist stone. In particular, sculptors
produced many fine Buddha images with
realistic anatomy and flowing robes.

THINK ABOUT IT
Do you know where Gāndhāra is? Does it remind you of a
character from the epic Mahābhārata?

Tapestry of the Past
6 – The Age of Reorganisation

Continuing the trend set under the Indo-Greek rulers, Kuṣhāṇa
art and architecture, exemplified by the Gāndhāra and Mathurā
schools of art, are celebrated for their fusion of Indian and Greek
styles. The sculptures feature a variety of deities reflecting the
peaceful co-existence of various schools of thought. This era saw
the rise of representations of deities — like
Sūrya or the sun god — which looked more
similar to humans and the increase in the
development of religious art, laying the
groundwork for later temple architecture in
the subcontinent.

The Mathurā style developed in
the Mathura region of presentday Uttar Pradesh and is known
for its distinct Indian style.
Unlike the Gāndhāra style, it
primarily used red sandstone
for its sculptures and reflects
less influence from GrecoRoman aesthetics. This art form
is known for its depictions of
Indian deities, including Kubera,
Lakṣhmī, Śhiva, Buddha, yakṣhas
and yakṣhiṇīs and generally
produced fuller figures with
smooth modelling.

Now that you are familiar with the basic characteristics of
the Mathurā and Gāndhāra styles of art, study the pictures of
artefacts given in Fig. 6.27 on the right page and try to identify

Chapter 6.indd 140

Despite the political conflicts and power struggles, the period
saw remarkable cultural exchange and assimilation. This
shared heritage is evident in art and architecture, where styles
interacted, but with a dominance of Indian themes (especially
Hindu and Buddhist ones). It was also the age when Sanskrit
literature flourished, with, in particular, the composition of
major Indian texts such as the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyana
(refer to the chapter “Unity in Diversity, or ‘Many in the One’ ” in
your Grade 6 textbook).
Recognising these connections encourages us to view this
‘Tapestry of the Past’ not as confined to any one kingdom or
ruler, but as a dynamic process that works through interaction
and assimilation over time.

Before we move on …
Æ

The period after the disintegration of the Maurya empire
was characterised by the emergence of many big and small
kingdoms across the Subcontinent.

Æ

The internal conflicts were coupled with foreign invasions,
which together led to a period of reorganisation of political
powers.

08-04-2025 11:38:50

Æ

This period witnessed a dialogue of various cultures that
absorbed each other’s influence to create new styles of art,
architecture, coinage, etc., with ultimately a dominance of
Indian themes and flourishing Sanskrit literature.

Æ

This time was also marked by remarkable developments in
trade activities, both internal and external.

Dhruv: Do not worry, Bhavisha! Let us understand what is
happening, and we’ll remember it.
Bhavisha: Is there anything in this period that we can see back

08-04-2025 11:41:38

Tour Guide: The 6-tonne pillar was erected during the reign of
Chandragupta II, a ruler of the Gupta dynasty. It was probably
erected first in front of the Udayagiri caves (Madhya Pradesh) and
brought to Delhi a few centuries later. It was dedicated to Viṣhṇu,
and its inscriptions celebrate the king’s achievements.
Both: That is so fascinating! We would love to learn more about
this king and his empire.
Let us begin this exciting journey into the history of the Gupta
Empire!

DON’T MISS OUT
Picture leaving a bicycle out in the rain for just one year — it
would soon show signs of rust. Yet this ancient pillar, standing
under the open sky for centuries, remains unaltered. Scientists
have tried to uncover its secret, and they believe it is because a
unique thin layer, created by the special iron used and oxygen
from the air, forms on the surface of the iron, protecting it
from corrosion.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

A New Power Emerges
By the 3rd century CE, the Kuṣhāṇa Empire, which spread over
the north and northwest of the Subcontinent, started to weaken.
New kingdoms emerged, setting the stage for a fresh period of
consolidation, and the new actor on this stage was the Gupta
dynasty.
There are various theories on the origin of the Guptas. However,
it is widely believed that they emerged in a region near presentday Uttar Pradesh as regional rulers. Over time, they rose to
prominence and established a powerful empire. The Gupta
period is considered remarkable in Indian history and is
marked by significant developments in many areas. The fields of
art, architecture, literature and science flourished, particularly
during the time of Chandragupta II, and that legacy continues
even today.

The inscription on the iron pillar in Delhi speaks of a king named
‘Chandra’, who has been identified with Chandragupta II (not
to be confused with Chandragupta Maurya from the Maurya
dynasty, whom we met earlier). Chandragupta II, also known
as ‘Vikramāditya’, was one of the renowned rulers of the Gupta
dynasty. He was a devotee of Viṣhṇu and his mount (vāhana)
Garuḍa often appears on many inscriptions.

Have you noticed the ‘II’ in Chandragupta II’s name?
Historians added this number because there was another
‘Chandragupta’ before him — his grandfather! (This tradition
of naming the first son after his grandfather is followed by
some Indian families even today.) Chandragupta I, as he is
referred to, played a crucial role in the early expansion of the
Gupta Empire; he is remembered for his coins and strategic
alliances, which helped him consolidate his power and lay the
foundation for a strong empire.

Many defeated kings were
reinstated and offered tribute
to Samudragupta, while others,
fearing his might, submitted
without protest.

Harisena also wrote about how the

himself is portrayed as a veena

minted (Fig. 7.6).

LET’S REMEMBER
Ambitious kings sometimes performed the aśhvamedha yajn͂a
to build mighty empires and leave a legacy for the future.
Such a significant event was commemorated by minting
special coins like the one shown in Fig 7.7.

Some literary sources give us descriptive information about
rulers, kingdoms and the people. The Viṣhṇu Purāṇa, for
instance, specifies the key regions of the empire: “The Gupta
dynasty will rule over Anugaṅga (the middle-Gangetic basin),
Prayāga (present-day Prayagraj), Sāketa (Ayodhya), and Magadha
(approximately Bihar) and all the surrounding regions.” But at
its peak, the Gupta Empire covered a larger area than this — most
of present-day north and west India, along with parts of central
and east India.

LET’S EXPLORE

Imagine what it would have entailed to move a whole army of
soldiers, elephants, horses, cooks, and other support staff, as
well as the supplies to feed them all. Clearly, the tributary kings
must have been asked to provide for these.

LET’S EXPLORE
Take a political map of India and locate the present-day
states and Union territories where the Guptas ruled (see
Fig. 7.8). Mark these states on the map and count how many
you found. Then, compare your findings with your friends to
see if everyone got the same number or discovered something
different!

A Traveller’s Account of Indian Society in
the Gupta Age
Chinese traveller Faxian (pronounced as Fa-Shi-Anne) visited
India in the early 5th century CE. He set out on this long and
difficult pilgrimage to visit sacred Buddhist sites, learn from
renowned Indian scholars and collect manuscripts of Buddhist
texts so he could take them back to China. Faxian travelled
extensively across India, observing her culture, governance and
society, and recorded his experiences and observations for the
people of his homeland — and for us too — since his travelogue
has survived to this day!

The people are numerous and happy […] they have no need to
register households or attend to officials. […] Those who farm
royal land pay a portion of their grain. […] The king’s guards and
attendants have salaries […] The cities are the greatest in the
Middle Kingdom [i.e. the Gangetic plains], and the inhabitants
are rich, prosperous, and practice kindness and righteousness.
Heads of Vaishya families [i.e. merchants or traders] establish
houses for charity and medicines […] the poor, orphans and the
sick are cared for […] doctors provide treatment, and the needy
receive food and medicines. […] The city has many wealthy
Vaishya elders and foreign merchants, with beautiful homes
[…] The lanes are kept in good order.
– A Record of Buddhistic
Kingdoms (AD 399–414) (Translated by J. Legge)

LET’S EXPLORE
Read the excerpt from Faxian given above and identify the
key features of the society he describes. Write down your
observations and compare your notes with your friends — you
might be surprised to see how differently others interpret the
same text!

Tapestry of the Past

Below is an excerpt from his travelogue, where he records
his observations of the society in the Gupta era.

this case,

Excerpts from historical accounts like Faxian’s are valuable
sources, but they reflect only the writer’s perspective and focus
at one point in time and for a limited portion of the society
they describe. Let us not, however, forget that elsewhere in his
travelogue, Faxian also describes the harsh treatment of the
chanḍālas, who were regarded as outcastes and lived outside
the city limits.
Just as you may have perceived the excerpt from Faxian’s
travelogue differently from your friends, a group of historians
may examine the same source and draw varied interpretations
from it. Historians then look at more sources to corroborate their
understanding. This reminds us of the need to assess multiple
sources, perspectives and interpretations before drawing
conclusions.

Chapter 7.indd 154

Let us observe the map in Fig. 7.8. You will notice that many
kingdoms coexisted during the same period. Some of them may
have been at war with each other in their ambition to expand
their control. Recall what we saw earlier about Kauṭilya’s ideas
on ruling a kingdom. He advised rulers to form alliances (mitra)
as one of the components of the saptānga.
New kings … new titles
Inscriptions and coins provide valuable insights into the
titles adopted by Gupta rulers, such as ‘mahārājadhirāja’,
‘samrāṭ’, and ‘chakravartin’. These titles reflected their claim
to supreme authority and emphasised their superiority
over earlier rulers who used simpler titles like ‘rājan’ and
‘mahārāja’.
The Gupta rulers used various strategies, including military
conquests, diplomacy, and alliances, to expand and consolidate
their vast empire. The last method included matrimonial
alliances. A well-known example is that of Prabhāvatī Gupta,

daughter of Chandragupta II, who was married to a prince of
the Vākāṭaka kingdom — the Guptas’ neighbours to the south.
Tragically, the Vākāṭaka prince died early, making her the regent
ruler of the kingdom. During her reign, she ensured that the
ties between the Vākāṭakas and the Guptas remained strong.
One of her inscriptions describes her as a ‘mother of two kings’,
referring to her two sons who ascended the Vākāṭaka throne. As
a devotee of Viṣhṇu like her father, Prabhāvatī is also associated
with the construction of seven temples dedicated to this god and
his avatars. Some of these temples are in Ramagiri (Ramtek hill)
in present-day Maharashtra.

The Gupta Empire had a well-organised system of administration.
Instead of controlling everything from a central authority, they
divided the empire into provinces and granted land to local
rulers, priests and chieftains. These land grants were carefully
inscribed on copper plates to keep accurate records — many of
which have been discovered by archaeologists in recent times.
This system helped ensure proper tax collection and allowed the
Gupta rulers to govern efficiently while still giving local leaders
some control over their regions.

Thriving trade

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

The primary source of revenue of the Gupta’s was land tax.
Other sources included fines, taxes on mines, irrigation, trade and
crafts. This revenue was used for administration, maintaining
the army, building temples and infrastructure, and supporting
scholars and artists.

156

Chapter 7.indd 156

As we see once again, for such an empire to sustain itself, it had
to promote a vibrant internal and external trade. In the Gupta
era, India traded with the Mediterranean world, Southeast Asia
and China, exporting textiles, spices, ivory and gemstones. The
Indian Ocean trade network connected Indian ports to distant
markets. One significant stop on the way to the Mediterranean
markets was Socotra Island, strategically located in the Arabian
Sea. Archaeological evidence, such as pottery, inscriptions in
the Brahmi script, and designs such as a Buddhist stūpa, has
established the presence of Indian traders there over several
centuries, apart from traders from Egypt, Arabia, Rome and
Greece. This small island carries evidence of the rich cultural
exchanges that trade promoted in the Indian Ocean.

New Ideas and Wonders: The Classical Age
As we saw, Gupta rulers were devout followers of Viṣhṇu; this
is often reflected in their coins and inscriptions. However,
they also supported other traditions and schools of thought.
They patronised Buddhist institutions, including the renowned
Nālandā university and several other Buddhist vihāras
(monastery). Their approach was inclusive and open. We will
explore these institutions further in higher grades.

Indeed, the prolonged period of peace and stability during the
Gupta period promoted notable achievements in various fields,
leading some historians to label this period the ‘classical age’
of India. It was also the time when knowledge from previous
eras was consolidated and compiled into numerous texts.
Sanskrit literature flourished, with Kālidāsa’s works and many
major Purāṇas. Āryabhaṭa and Varāhamihira recorded major
advancements in mathematics and astronomy, while medical texts
compiled and refined medical theories and practices. Metallurgy
also progressed, as we saw with the rust-resistant Iron Pillar.
This stability strengthened the
economy, allowing the state to
support scholars, artists, and
scientists, leading to cultural
and intellectual growth.
Chandragupta II kept himself
surrounded by many learned
men, poets and artists, and his
patronage of such diverse talent
enriched his court greatly.
Let us take a look at some of
the remarkable figures of this
period.

Āryabhaṭa: He lived in Kusumapura (near present-day Patna), a
famous centre of learning, around 500 CE and authored a short
treatise of mathematics and astronomy called Āryabhaṭīya. He
gave formulas to calculate the motions of the Sun, the Moon and
the planets, and proposed that the Earth spins on its axis, which
explains the alternation of day and night. He gave the length
of a year as 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 30 seconds, just
a few minutes off from the modern value (365 days, 5 hours,
48 minutes, and 45 seconds). Āryabhaṭa also provided a fair
estimate of the size of the Earth and a correct explanation for
solar and lunar eclipses. His work became the foundation for
further scientific advances in India and beyond. In mathematics,
Āryabhaṭa described a number of techniques of calculation and
equation-solving, some of which you learn at school without
knowing that they were first formulated 1500 years ago!

Varāhamihira: He was a
mathematician, astronomer
and astrologer from the same

of learning and scholarship.
His
encyclopedic
work,
Bṛihat Samhitā, covered a
wide range of subjects from
astronomy and astrology
to

and even farming. His
ability to observe the world,

combine it with traditional
knowledge made him a
pioneer in science.

Āryabhaṭa and Varāhamihira—what would you ask them?
Divide the class into two groups and create a series of questions
for an interview with them.

Kālidāsa: Little is known about Kālidāsa’s life; legends
suggest that he was once ridiculed by others, which
motivated him to work hard and transform his life. He
is renowned for his contributions to Sanskrit literature
and exquisitely refined poetry. One of his celebrated
compositions is Meghadūtam, or ‘The Cloud Messenger’.
It tells the story of a yakṣha (minor deity), who, after
being banished from his home by his master, sends a
message to his beloved through a passing cloud. Apart
from the many emotions of love, the poem describes in
great detail the landscapes and weather of north India
on its journey to the beloved.

Did you know that Āyurveda got codified during the Gupta
period? This Indian traditional system of medicine has much
older roots, going back several centuries BCE. Texts like
the Charaka Saṃhitā and Suśhruta Saṃhitā, which laid the
foundation for Ayurvedic practices still in use today, were
compiled and given their final shape during the Gupta period.
They deal with a wide range of topics — the cataloguing and
diagnosing of diseases, their treatments, the importance of
diet in maintaining good health, the preparation of medicines,
and surgical techniques advanced for their time. Importantly,
Āyurveda emphasises holistic healing and a deep connection
between the mind, body, and nature.

The Quest for Beauty
The Gupta rulers created a supportive environment where
creativity and craftsmanship thrived; some of the iconic works
of history were produced during this time. Many key centres
of art emerged during these times, including Sārnāth (near
Varanasi in present-day Uttar Pradesh), known for its exquisite
sculptures of the Buddha, and the awe-inspiring Ajanta caves
(in present-day Maharashtra). The rock-cut caves and detailed
carvings of deities at Udayagiri (Madhya Pradesh) are another
example of this abundant artistic production. ‘Gupta art’, as it
is sometimes called, set high standards of aesthetics and beauty
that left a lasting impact. (See Figures 7.15 to 7.18)

The Decline of the Guptas
By the 6th century CE, the Gupta Empire began showing signs
of decline as the later rulers faced challenges from external
invasions. The fierce Hūṇa tribe from central Asia repeatedly
attacked the empire, weakening its control over north India. At
the same time, the rise of powerful regional rulers led to internal
conflicts. However, was this truly the end, or the beginning of a
period that marked a turning point in Indian history? We will
explore this question in the next part of this book.

Meanwhile in the South and Northeast ...

The Pallavas were also great patrons of art and architecture. Most
of them were devotees of Śhiva and are credited with constructing
magnificent temples and rock-cut caves, some of which we will
visit when we explore classical Indian architecture. The capital
of the Pallavas, Kānchipuram (in present-day Tamil Nadu), often
known as the ‘city of a thousand temples’, developed as one of
the major centres of learning in the south. The establishment of
ghaṭikās — centres of learning that emerged during the reign of
the Sātavāhanas — fostered an environment for education and
intellectual growth.
In the northeastern region, the Kāmarūpa kingdom, ruled by
the Varman dynasty, extended over the Brahmaputra valley
(broadly, present-day Assam) and northern parts of present-day
Bengal and Bangladesh. An ancient name for the Brahmaputra
valley of Assam is Prāgjyotiṣha, mentioned in the Rāmāyaṇa
and Mahābhārata; the latter text mentions Bhagadatta, king of

Tapestry of the Past
7 – The Gupta Era: An Age of Tireless Creativity

Let us go back to the map in Fig. 7.8. While the Guptas ruled in
the north, the Pallavas emerged as a powerful dynasty in the
south, gradually consolidating their power in parts of presentday Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.
Their origins are not clearly known, but they appear to have
been a tributary power under the Sātavāhanas, whom we
encountered in the previous chapter, and to have gained power
as the Sātavāhanas declined.

him among their ancestors. Be that as it may, the Kāmarūpa
kingdom was a prominent cultural and political centre; temples
and monasteries flourished as hubs of learning.
Both the Pallavas and Kāmarūpa are mentioned in the prayāga
praśhasti we saw earlier. During his southern campaigns,
Samudragupta defeated a Pallava ruler but did not take over
the region. Instead, he let the local kings, including the Pallavas,

08-04-2025 11:41:50

keep their thrones as long as they accepted his rule and paid
tribute. This helped maintain peaceful relations. Under similar
conditions, in the northeast, Samudragupta defeated the ruler of
Kāmarūpa but did not take direct control. By now, we have seen
this pattern recur quite a few times.
The Gupta period was a time of remarkable progress. Its influence
stretched far beyond the empire, shaping art, science, literature,
and governance for centuries. Advances in mathematics,
astronomy, medicine and metallurgy, among other fields, laid
the foundation for future scientific and technological growth,
while beautiful temples and Sanskrit literature continue to
inspire today. The Guptas created a stable and prosperous
society, setting a model for future rulers. Their legacy is still
alive in India’s culture, traditions, and way of life, marking this
era as one of the high points in Indian history.

Æ

The Gupta kings consolidated their power through military
campaigns, land grants and matrimonial alliances to ensure
stability in the empire.

Æ

The period saw remarkable contributions in the fields of
art, literature, science and mathematics.

Other than the Guptas, dynasties like Vākāṭakas, Pallavas,
and Varmans ruled in their respective regions, making this
period full of cultural and intellectual vibrancy.

What is ‘Sacredness’?
Sacredness can have many meanings. In the limited context of
this chapter, sacredness is finding something of deep religious or
spiritual significance, worthy of respect and reverence, holy or
divine. But what is this ‘something’? It can be a special location or
shrine that evokes such deep feelings, high thoughts or emotions.
It can also be, as we will see in this chapter, a journey of a special
kind (often called a ‘pilgrimage’), the route the journey takes, or
even the very land covered.
Sacredness, therefore, is not just connected with religion and
spirituality, but also with geography, all sorts of traditions, and, in
the case of India, with something more that we will discover soon.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

Let us focus on sacred places first. You will find that almost every
school of thought and religion in India has its own sacred places.

Pilgrimage:
A journey
to a sacred
place that is
significant
within a
religion
or belief
system.

Naturally, when we turn to religions that originated in India,
we find that they have many more sacred sites. In the case of
Buddhism, those are often places that were visited by the Buddha
or where his relics are kept. Among them is the Great Stūpa at
Sanchi (Madhya Pradesh), which is a relic stūpa (you saw this in
the chapter on ‘The Rise of Empires’), and the Mahabodhi Stūpa
in Bodh Gaya (Bihar), where, according to Buddhist tradition,
the Buddha attained enlightenment. They are important sites
for pilgrims; Bodh Gaya, for instance, receives more than four
million visitors every year.

Shrine:
A place
regarded
as holy
because
of its
associations
with
the divine, a
sacred relic,
or a spiritual
figure.

In Sikhism, takhts
are
seats
or
centres of spiritual
authority — for
example, the Takht
Sri Patna Sahib (in
Patna), the Akal Takht
(part of the Golden
Temple at Amritsar,
see Fig. 8.3), and Takht
Sri Keshgarh Sahib
(at Anandpur). Sikhs
aspire to undertake
Fig. 8.3
pilgrimages to these
places at least once in their lifetimes, as they are associated with
important Sikh Gurus and therefore have special significance. In
addition, Sikh tradition records pilgrimages conducted by several
Gurus, such as Guru Nanak, to places like Haridwar, Prayag,
Mathura, Varanasi, Ayodhya, Puri and many more, besides a few
Muslim shrines.

The places in these pictures are revered by followers of Islam,
Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism — religions that
originated outside India. People visit or congregate in these places
for prayer and worship. Followers from other faiths also visit
them, as can be seen at the Dargah Sharif of Ajmer (Rajasthan) or
the Velankanni Church in Tamil Nadu. People go on pilgrimages
to these shrines on special occasions.

Tīrtha:
Literally, a
place where
one can cross
a river or
other body
of water.
Symbolically,
it becomes a
place where
one can
cross from
the ordinary
worldly life
to a higher,
spiritual
life. Such
places are
held in high
reverence
and regarded
as sacred.

India has, for ages past, been a country of pilgrimages.
All over the country, you find these ancient places, from
Badrinath, Kedarnath and Amarnath, high up in the snowy
Himalayas down to Kanyakumari in the south. What has
drawn our people from the south to the north and from
the north to the south in these great pilgrimages? It is the
feeling of one country and one culture.
— Jawaharlal Nehru, 1961

Pilgrimages
Many Indians undertake tīrthayātrās or pilgrimages to various
sacred sites (tīrthas) during their lifetime. This ancient and
continuous tradition of pilgrimage is not just a physical journey
but also an inner journey that requires a specified code of
conduct.
For at least 3,000 years, and with no modern means of
transportation available, Indians have been crisscrossing the
Subcontinent, resulting in its entire geography being considered
sacred. We will return to this soon.

Here’s an excerpt from the writings of Dharampal, a historian
and thinker:
“I was travelling from Gwalior to Delhi … when I met a group of
people … about twelve of them, some three or four women and
seven or eight men ... They said that they had been on a pilgrimage,
three months long, up to Rameswaram, among other places. They
came from two different villages north of Lucknow. They had
various bundles of things and some earthen pots with them ... They
had taken all the necessities for their food—atta, ghee, sugar—
with them … I asked them, “You are going to Delhi now?” “Yes!”,
they replied. “You will stop in Delhi?” “No, we only have to change
trains there. We’re going to Haridwar! ... We don’t have time … We
have to go to Haridwar. And then we have to get back home.”

route the group must have taken from Rameswaram to
Haridwar. Why do you think the group was going straight
to Haridwar instead of stopping at Delhi?

Æ

In ancient times, when people were travelling from
Madurai in Tamil Nadu to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh,
what languages would they come across? How would they
communicate with people in those places? Where would
they stay? What food would they eat?

In the Jain tradition, the tīrthas are associated with places where
the Tīrthankaras attained liberation or where significant events
of their lives occurred. Trees, ponds, hills and mountains that the
Tīrthankaras visited or meditated at are also considered sacred.
Examples of such places include Mount Abu, Girnar and the
Śhatruñjaya hill in Saurashtra (Gujarat).
Another example is the pilgrimage to Sabarimala temple
(Kerala), dedicated to the deity Ayyappa, which draws over ten
million devotees every year. This hilltop shrine was traditionally
reached by an immensely
difficult trek through hills and
forests. Such a challenging
approach,
common
to
many hilltop or mountain
shrines all over the country,
symbolises the difficulties of
the inner path, with natural
landmarks along the route
being considered sacred.

More sacred sites
Hindu and many folk and tribal belief
systems go further. In Grade 6 we learnt
that in such belief systems, people regard
elements of Nature, such as mountains,
rivers, trees, plants and animals, and
sometimes stones too, as sacred. In
Hinduism, for instance, this includes
countless geographical sites or features
of Nature, such as specific mountains,
rivers and forests, which are regarded as
particularly divine and are worshipped
as deities; many rivers are regarded
as devīs, while some species of trees,
animals and plants are particularly holy.
This tradition comes from the perception
of a divine presence in all of Nature.
Ultimately, the whole of planet Earth is
considered sacred — she is Mother Earth
or Bhūdevī.

The Niyam Dongar hill in the Niyamgiri Range of Jharkhand
is sacred to the Dongria Khond tribe. They believe that the
hill is the abode of Niyam Raja, the supreme deity who
provides everything they need for sustenance. Cutting trees
here is prohibited and considered a sign of disrespect to the
deity.



In the early 2000s, the Government of Sikkim identified
several sacred mountains, caves, lakes, rocks and hot springs
that were to be protected against all forms of damage.



In the Nilgiris of Tamil Nadu, the Todas, a tribal community,
regard many mountain peaks as sacred and associate them
with their gods. To them, this sense of sacredness extends to
many plants (which often become part of their rituals), Shola
forests, wetlands, and even specific stones and individual
trees.

While visiting the major sacred places connected to their
respective faiths, pilgrims would naturally cover the geography
of India. They would come across diverse languages, customs,
clothing and foods along the way, but would notice the
commonalities too.

8 – How the Land Becomes Sacred

There is a story about the 51 Shakti pīṭhas. Shakti, the divine
mother in the form of Satī, and her consort, Śhiva, were insulted
by her father. An angry Satī immolated herself. Shiva was so
livid that he took her body and refused to allow the last rites.
Śhiva’s anger was dangerous for the world and the cosmos. So
Viṣhṇu used his chakra to cut up Satī’s body. The Shakti pīṭhas
are the places across the Subcontinent where the body parts of
the divine mother fell one by one. The symbol behind the story
is clear: the whole land becomes the body of the divine mother.

Why did people travel such long distances? Apart from religious
motivations, some, like merchants and traders, travelled to
exchange goods; others travelled to discuss, debate and popularise
their beliefs or to learn and study from eminent teachers in
different parts of the country. However, though they were
travelling for different purposes, their routes often converged.
Discussions and debates, sharing of goods, experiences, and
tales, enriched everyone. New ideas emerged, and old ones were
adapted. This complex process became a major factor in the
cultural integration of the Indian Subcontinent.

Sacred Ecology
Tīrthas are usually located on the banks of a river or a lake, in a
forest or on a mountain. As we saw above, the natural landscape
itself is thus seen or perceived as sacred space, or puṇyakṣhetra.
This perception has helped us to protect and preserve Nature,
since we are not distinct from her. So geography, culture and
spirituality fuse together in these kṣhetras.

Rivers and sangams (confluence of rivers)

Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Sarasvati, Narmada, Sindhu,
and Kaveri, may you manifest in this water.
Those rivers have been lifelines for the Indian civilisation. Their
sources, tributaries and the places they flow through are often
regarded as sacred too, and are visited by many pilgrims. In local
languages, these rivers are referred to with respect—for instance,
‘Ganga ji’ or ‘Yamuna ji’.

Rivers have been worshipped in India since Vedic times. The
nadīstuti sūkta of the Ṛigveda is a hymn (sūkta) in praise of (stuti)
rivers (nadī) that invokes 19 major rivers of ancient northwest
India. Even today, many rituals involving water invoke the
presence of some of the most important rivers of India:

Prayagraj hosts the Kumbh Mela every six years. Prayag is
located at the confluence of three rivers — Ganga, Yamuna
and the invisible Sarasvati. A few years ago, UNESCO listed
the Kumbh Mela as an ‘intangible heritage of the world’.

An estimated 660 million people participated in the
Kumbh Mela of 2025. What proportion of the population
of India is this?

Kumbh Mela

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

The Kumbh Mela originates in the legend of amṛita manthana.
The devas and asuras (i.e., more or less, gods and demons),
traditional enemies, for once joined forces in churning the
cosmic ocean to extract amṛita, the divine nectar that would give
them immortality. To prevent the asuras from getting the amṛita,
Viṣhṇu, in the form of Mohini, a beautiful lady, snatched the
pitcher or kumbha which contained the amṛita. In the process,
a few drops fell over four places — Haridwar, Prayagraj, Nashik,
and Ujjain. These are the places where the Kumbh Mela has been
held, and a dip in the rivers there during a prescribed period is
considered most auspicious.

All over the world, mountains are often associated with legends,
deities or heroes. Also mountains are seen as a symbolic gateway
from earth to heaven because of their height. That is why many
tīrthas and temples in India are located on hilltops, as the
physical journey to these peaks is seen as a symbolic journey
to reach the divine. People would undertake arduous walks
through mountain trails to those sites and shrines, which tested
not only their physical abilities but also their mental strength.
Today, such places are often accessible through roads and other
modes of transport.

Trees, Forests and Sacred Groves

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

In many parts of India, trees are adorned with offerings like
turmeric and kumkum. One species of fig tree commonly called
‘peepul’ (or ‘pipal’), ‘bo tree’ or ‘bodhi tree’ (aśhvattha in Sanskrit)
is sacred to Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism. In fact, its
botanical name is Ficus religiosa (literally, in Latin, the ‘religious’
or sacred fig tree).

178

Chapter 8.indd 178

Fig. 8.10. The tree in the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya is often cited as a direct
descendant of the original tree under which, according to Buddhist tradition, the
Buddha attained enlightenment — hence the names ‘bodhi tree’ and ‘Bodh Gaya’.

In Grade 6 we read about the two epics of India, the Mahābhārata
and Rāmāyaṇa. These texts have vivid descriptions of pilgrimages
undertaken and places visited, and of sacred rivers, forests and
mountains. In almost every region of India, numerous rural
and tribal traditions claim that the heroes of these texts passed
through their locality, with shrines often marking such passages.
Such legends allowed a wide diversity of communities to make
the two epics their own.

important part of India’s cultural geography for millennia.

THINK ABOUT IT

Over time, many rural and tribal communities across India
decided to protect and preserve some natural forests from
harmful activities such as hunting, tree felling or mining.
They saw those forests as the abodes of deities — for example,
Ryngkew or Basa in Meghalaya. Such special forests are called
‘sacred groves’ in English (see the table below for a few names
in regional languages) and, thanks to their sacred status, have
come to shelter great biodiversity of flora and fauna. Many
sacred groves are also home to small water bodies and thus help
in water conservation.
There were many thousands of sacred groves in India. Sadly,
these numbers have been shrinking as people have started
encroaching on them for various purposes, from agriculture to
industry. Still, sacred groves continue to be protected in many
regions of India.

Many parts of the peepul tree have medical uses: the leaves
are used to treat some skin ailments while the bark is useful
for stomach ailments. Since it stays green almost through the
year, it provides food and shelter to many types of birds and
other animals.

In Tamil Nadu, local chronicles highlight the relationship
between the deity of a sacred grove, Nature and humans. One
such chronicle in the Thanjavur District states that the groves’
deities protect fruit bats, which are regarded as sacred – spotting
one of them is considered auspicious. Besides, bats play a critical
role in the pollination of flowers and in the dispersal of seeds.
Sacred groves thus evolve a harmonious relationship between
the deity, the ecosystem, and humans.

From pilgrimage to trade

What routes did those traders use in ancient India? Revisit the
map of trade routes (Fig. 5.5) in the chapter ‘The Rise of Empires’.
Uttarapatha was a major trade route connecting the northwestern and eastern parts of the Subcontinent; the Dakṣhinapātha
went from Kaushāmbī through Ujjayinī (Ujjain) to Pratiṣhthāna
(Paithan). As you know, some of the goods traded along these
routes included precious stones like shells and pearls, coins, gold
and diamonds, as well as cotton, spices, and sandalwood.

Pilgrims encounter traders and
merchants along their journey. This
interaction benefits both groups.
Pilgrims need various items, which
traders can provide. As a result, the
pilgrimage routes and the trade routes
often overlap. Some traders might
also double as pilgrims, taking their
wares to distant towns and cities
while visiting sacred sites and shrines.

Sacred Geography beyond India
The concept and practice of sacred geography are not unique
to India. Ancient Greece had many sacred landmarks, from
mountains to sacred groves. The Native Americans used to
have a special bond with Nature, which they viewed as sacred.
The Maoris, the indigenous people of New Zealand, regard the
Taranaki Maunga mountain as their ancestor and therefore as
sacred; after many representations by the Maoris, a law recently
granted this mountain the rights and responsibilities of a human
being — an acknowledgement of the Maori worldview. The elders
of the community represent the voice of the mountain or river
threatened with destruction. This ensures that the sacred places
are not exploited and degenerated.

Fig. 8.18

Look carefully at these pictures of places and animals that are
considered sacred. The Yamuna in the north, the Mahanadi in
the east or the Kaveri in the south are all sacred rivers. How
come they have become so polluted? Are there sacred places
in your locality or region that have been similarly polluted
or degraded by human activity? Whose responsibility is it to
preserve the sanctity of our sacred places? Discuss in class.

08-04-2025 12:53:36

A harmonious relationship that once existed between people
and the sacred geography sustained Indian civilisation over
millennia, creating values that were shared all over the
Subcontinent. But today it is under great strain.
Sacred geography continues to be relevant today. When there
is a conflict in our relationship with Nature, when a river
is overexploited to the point of disappearance, or a sacred
mountain is challenged with competing ideas of development,
people have spoken up to protect their environment, their
deities and values. At a time when sustainability has become a
global issue, a worldview that embeds sacred geography has a
significant contribution to make.

Æ

All religions in India have their sacred places dotted over
the landscape. In Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, such
places are usually associated with some of the great figures
in these belief systems.

Æ

Hinduism has dense networks of pilgrimage sites, covering
the entire geography of India. The practice of pilgrimage
is interwoven with the lives of people, as it serves the
individual development and spiritual growth, but also the
socio-economic purposes of trade expansion and pan-Indian
cultural integration.

Æ

In many Hindu, tribal and folk traditions, the very land is
perceived as sacred.

Æ

Our sacred places are being polluted owing to widespread
neglect and a lack of concern. It is our duty to protect our
national heritage, as our Constitution also reminds us.

kin, not resources; or if the planet is our mother, not an
opportunity—then we will treat each other with greater
respect. Thus is the challenge, to look at the world from a
different perspective.”

Discuss in small groups. What do you think this statement
means? What implication does it have for our actions
with respect to the air, water, land, trees and mountains
around us?
2.

List the sacred sites in your region. Enquire into why
they are considered sacred. Are there stories connected
with these sacred places? Write a short essay of 150
words. (Hint: You could speak to elders in your family and
community, discuss with your teacher, read books and
articles, etc., to gather relevant information.)

and forests are considered sacred for the people? How do
they contribute to our lives?

includes:


maintaining law and order in society;



ensuring peace, stability, and security for the people;



managing relationships with other countries;



taking care of national defence;



delivering essential goods

What is Democracy?

THINK ABOUT IT

A school example
A school is full of activities and things that must be done. Many
day-to-day tasks need to be managed, and things need to be
organised. For example, there are timetables to be made and
followed, sports activities to be organised, food to be served
during lunch time (also called the mid-day-meal), utensils to be
cleaned, speakers to be decided for the morning assembly, and
activities to be arranged for ‘No Bag Days’. The list is very long
in terms of all that needs to be done in the school.
With so many things to be done, the Head Teacher realised that a
Student Committee should be appointed so that students can be
part of making the relevant rules to get all this done, then help in
implementation of the rules, and ensure that the rules are being
followed. The question before the Head Teacher was — who will
be part of the committee?
The Head Teacher discussed this in the assembly. She proposed
that it would be good if some students can take responsibility
for these tasks. A student committee should be formed. Hearing
this, the students got excited and started arguing.
Naghma: Students in Grade 12 are
the most senior; we will take care of
everything.
Shobha: But you will finish school in a
few months. The students in Grade 11
should take care of everything.
Gurpreet: If the students of only one
grade will take care of everything,
then how will they know about the
problems that other grades face?

Discuss with your
teacher in the
classroom and
make a list.

Governance and Democracy
9 – From the Rulers to the Ruled: Types of Government

As we studied in Grade 6, ‘democracy’ is best understood as ‘rule
of the people.’ This means that the source of power and authority
in a democracy are the people of the country. Let’s understand
this with the example of a school.

187

02-06-2025 09:59:48

In this exciting situation, the students finally came to three
options:
Representative:
A person who is
chosen to act or
make decisions
on behalf of
another person
or group of
people



Everyone in the school becomes part of the committee and
takes responsibility.



The Head Teacher chooses the students herself for the
committee.



The students choose their representatives through voting,
and the chosen representatives become the members of the
committee.

LET’S EXPLORE

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

Which of the three methods do you think is most effective?
Why?

188

Chapter 9.indd 188

The first method may seem appealing, but if every student in
the school is part of the committee, it will be difficult to reach
decisions and manage implementation effectively. In the second
method, since the Head Teacher selects the students for the
committee, many students will not have a role and won’t have
a way to ensure that their voices are heard regarding what
they need and want. However, in the third method, students
from each grade can choose one representative from among
themselves — someone they believe will effectively advocate
for their class’s needs. This representative will serve on the
committee, meaning that the student committee will consist of
representatives from each grade. This approach is a democratic
way to choose representatives and form a committee.

Functions of Government
Previously, we discussed the various roles that a government
plays in our lives, similar to the responsibilities of a student
committee in a school. Just like the school committee, a
government must create necessary rules, implement them,
and ensure that everyone follows these rules. These three
responsibilities are known as the functions of government.

08-04-2025 11:43:46

The creation of rules is called the legislative function; these
rules serve as the framework for running the country. The
implementation of these rules and the administration of the
country according to them is known as the executive function.
Finally, ensuring that the rules are followed is referred to as the
judicial function.
Democracy is defined as the ‘rule of the people’. This means
that, similar to the third method of electing representatives in a
school, in a democracy, the people select their representatives to
govern them. However, not every country uses the same method
for choosing these representatives. We will explore this topic in
more detail in the following sections.

What Makes Governments Different?
The government of any country evolves over time. Since countries
have their own history, culture, and aspirations, it is natural that
governments of different countries are different. Let’s look at
some aspects that can make one form of government different
from another. These differences will become clearer when we
look at various types of government later in the chapter.

Key differences between governments
Who gets to
decide that
‘this is the
government’?

190

Chapter 9.indd 190

What are
the different
parts of the
government
and what do
they do?

1.

Who gets to decide that ‘this is the government’?
This is the most basic difference across many types
of government. Who or what says that ‘this is the
government of our country’? That is, who or what gives
the government its authority and power? For example,
in a democracy like India, it is the people of the country
who decide and are the source of authority, while in a
theocracy, the source of authority is religious beliefs and
the head of a religious institution.

2.

How is the government formed? In a democracy, a
government is formed usually through some kind of
election. While in kingdoms which have kings or queens,
the kind that you have read about in other chapters,
usually someone from within the family continues to
rule and decide how the government will be set up.
There are other ways of forming a government, and even
in democracies there can be different kinds of elections.

3.

What are the different parts of the government and
what do they do? Any government has many parts
and systems, and these vary across different types
of government. For example, the three functions
of government referred to earlier — legislative,
executive, and judiciary — can be performed by totally
independent bodies or by the same body. The system to
decide how the government will work can be written
down in a book of fundamental rules of the country,
called the ‘constitution’, which is what happens in most

08-04-2025 11:43:47

democracies. Or it can be decided by the king or queen, as it
happens in ‘monarchies’ — governments of kings or queens.
4.

What is the government working for? What goals is it
trying to achieve? Governments are designed to work
towards certain values and ideals. Some governments,
like the government of India, are designed to work
towards equality and prosperity for all, while some other
governments may be designed only for the prosperity of
some families or groups.

What is the
government
working for?
What goals
is it trying to
achieve?

There are differences between different forms of government
based on these four major aspects, but there could be other
kind of differences. So, let us now look at some types or forms of
government.

Democratic Governments around
the World

Fundamental principles of democracy
Equality in a democracy means that every person has

the right to be treated equally. It also means that everyone
should have equal access to facilities like education and
health, and that everyone is equal before the law.
Freedom in democracy means that citizens have the right
to make their own choices and express their opinions.
Representative participation means that every person
has a right to choose and elect their representatives.
This is done through the process of elections. Elected
representatives become a part of the legislature.

Chapter 9.indd 191

Governance and Democracy
9 – From the Rulers to the Ruled: Types of Government

Democracy is the most popular form of government in the
modern world. In this part of the chapter, we will see that there
are different kinds of democratic governments. Before we
get into the differences, we should know that there are some
fundamental principles of any democracy.

191

08-04-2025 11:43:47

Universal adult franchise grants every citizen
(above a certain age) the right to vote to choose their
representative.
Fundamental rights of a citizen, such as — right to
equality, right to freedom of speech and expression,
and right against exploitation — are all provided and
protected in a democracy.
Independent judiciary ensures that every citizen’s
fundamental rights are protected, and that laws are
followed by the citizens and also by all the parts of the
government.
It is useful to remember that even these fundamental principles
have evolved over time. For example, India provided universal
adult franchise (meaning the right to vote in elections to all
adults) from the very beginning of the Indian republic in 1950;
on the other hand, in Switzerland, women got the right to vote
only in 1971.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

Clearly, the above principles are ideals; not all democracies are
able to put them in practice. But equally clearly, it is important
for the citizens to keep these ideals in front of them.

Different forms of democratic governments
Let us now understand the different forms of democratic
governments around the world.
1.

Direct democracy
This is a form of democracy where all the citizens of a
country are directly responsible for all the rules, regulations
and functions. They participate in all the decisions directly.
In contemporary times, some kinds of this form are
followed in a few countries, like Switzerland. The limitation
of this form of government is that it is very hard to carry
out in practice, particularly in larger countries — just as we
saw in our school story: if everyone becomes a part of the

192

Chapter 9.indd 192

08-04-2025 11:43:47

committee, then decision-making and working on all tasks
smoothly will be difficult.
2.

Representative democracy
This is the form of democratic government in which the
people elect their representatives through universal adult
franchise, just like in India. In this form of democracy, the
people do not directly govern, but the government is always
accountable to the people.

Elections are an integral part of representative democracy
through which people can express changes in their choices as
well. To accomplish this, elections happen in regular and fixed
intervals of time. In India we have general elections every five
years, while in the United States of America they occur every
four years.

Accountability:
Accountability
in democracy
means that the
government is
answerable to
the people who
have elected
them.

As we stated in the beginning, democracies have evolved
over time, and so have their characteristics. Even today,
there are a lot of differences in the functioning of these
democracies. It is useful to remember that when these
countries adopted democracies, they may not have had all
the principles of democracy as we understand them today.
For example, effective Universal Adult Suffrage in the UK
happened in 1928 and in the USA by 1965.

Most of the democracies today are
representative democracies. But every
democracy functions differently. Here are
the two forms of representative democracy.
a.

Fig. 9.5. Voting in India

Parliamentary democracy
In this form of government, the
members of the executive are also
part of the legislature. For example,
in India, the prime minister and the
council of ministers are also members
of the parliament.

The council of ministers are accountable to the legislature
and continue working as long as they have the confidence of
the legislature. In India, the council of ministers can continue
working while they have confidence of the Lok Sabha.
In this form of government, people elect the legislature
but not the executive. Selected members of the legislature
become ministers.

Chapter 9.indd 194

Presidential democracy
In this form of government, the executive works
independently of the legislature. The president is elected
by the people. The president does not need to have the
confidence of the legislature for his / her position.
In some countries like India, states within the country such
as Rajasthan or Kerala have their own governments, but they
are not completely independent. They are still governed by a
larger national government, the Union Government of India.

The different forms of democratic government have different
structures. You can understand the basic differences from the
table 9.1 on the facing page.

What do these terms mean?


Executive: The executive is the organ of the government
which is responsible for implementing the law. But the
process of its election is different in different countries.

Legislature: The legislature is the body of the government
which is responsible for making laws. It is known by different
names in different countries. In India, it is called Parliament;
in the USA, it is called Congress. In most democracies, it has
two houses, the Upper House and the Lower House.

Upper House and Lower House: In most countries, the
Lower House is elected by direct voting and is generally
more powerful than the Upper House, which is formed
either by election or nomination. These Houses are known
by different names in different countries. In India, the
Lower House is called the Lok Sabha, and the Upper House
is called the Rajya Sabha.



Separation of Power means that the three organs of the
government — Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary — work
independently and do not interfere in each other’s functions.

A Peek into History
Early republics
A republic is a form of government in which the head of state is
elected and is not a hereditary monarch.

Indeed, the voice of the common people has been valued and
upheld in India through the ages, even when the power was
in the hands of a king or queen. A remarkable example from
the Chola period is seen in the Uttaramerur inscriptions from
the 10th century CE in Tamil Nadu, which provide us with
details about the election of members to the village sabhā (local
administrative body). We learn about the election process,
including sealed ballot boxes, qualifications of members, their
duties, and also the conditions that could lead to their dismissal.

This was the case in at least two of India’s ancient
mahājanapadas, as you might recall from the chapter ‘New
Beginnings: Cities and States’. In the Vajji (or Vṛiji) mahājanapada,
the Lichchhavi clan, in particular, practised collective
decision-making, and leaders were chosen based on merit
rather than birth. Key positions were filled through elections,
and representatives from various clans met regularly to address
issues and develop solutions to ensure the people’s welfare. As a
result, such states have been called early republics.

For instance, members would be immediately removed if found
to have indulged in any corruption.
There were republics in other parts of the world too. In the 5th
and 4th centuries BCE, Rome and Greece had republics. In some
regions of Greece, free men could vote, but women, workers and
slaves could not. Other areas had a system where only a small,
privileged group could vote or make decisions.

Other Forms of Government
In the previous sections we saw that democracy is the most
popular form of government in today’s world, and that there are
different forms of democracy as well. Let us now look at other
forms of governments, and understand their basic structures.

1. Monarchy
As we saw in chapters of ‘Tapestry of the Past’, mahājanapadas
were headed by kings, who were guided by the sabhā or samiti and
were expected to take decisions and advice of these institutions
seriously. As empires were built and
expanded across India, kings began to
gain immense power. Yet, they relied on
a council of ministers and a network of
officials to help them govern the empire.
In many cases, the king also sought the
advice of learnt scholars on matters
related to dharma. Of course, there were
also examples of kings who used their
power to subjugate their people.
In some parts of the world, kings had all
the power; they made the laws, enforced
them, and also decided the punishments.
In some cases, they claimed to have
received divine power from God.
Fig. 9.7. Adoration of the pillar
of Sanchi Stūpa

However, in many parts of India, the
power of the raja was neither absolute
nor beyond question. The king was

08-04-2025 11:43:50

expected to make decisions while staying within the limits
of rājadharma; this meant ruling according to dharma and
ensuring the welfare of all people. This was an ideal that kings
did not necessarily achieve.

THINK ABOUT IT
What might happen if the king considered himself to have
divine powers? How would he rule over the people?

Fig. 9.8. A 17th-century Rajput miniature painting depicting
Bhīṣhma lying on a bed of arrows, teaching Yudhiṣṭhira while
Kṛiṣhṇa sits at the head, witnessing the moment.

In the Shānti Parva of the Mahābhārata, when Bhīṣhma,
the wise elder of the Kuru dynasty, lies on a bed of arrows
awaiting his death, he teaches Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest
Pāṇḍava, at great length on good governance, justice, and the
moral responsibilities of a raja. A raja is not just a ruler; the
welfare of his people is his highest priority. He must apply
the law without bias to ensure fairness and equality. He must
not get attached to power, as it fosters ego and corruption.
He must seek guidance from wise advisors to ensure just
and well-informed decisions. The raja must understand that
his authority is temporary and bound by dharma.

King Chandrāpīḍa wanted to build a temple to his deity,
but the hut of a stubborn cobbler stood in the way. When
the builders complained to the king that he did not even
allow them to take measurements, the king blamed them
for not asking the cobbler’s permission first. The king
received the cobbler, who explained that his humble hut
was like a mother to him and as precious to him as the
palace was to the king: “The misery people feel when
their homes are forcibly taken away can be described
only by a god who has fallen from his celestial car or
by a king who has lost his kingdom!” Nevertheless, the
cobbler expressed his readiness to let go of his hut if
only the king would come and respectfully ask for his
permission — which the king did, giving him adequate
money as compensation. “For those who desire
happiness, there should be no false pride,” concludes the
text, while the cobbler praised the king’s commitment
to dharma, even towards a lowly subject!

scholar Kalhaṇa (12th century CE)

Sovereign:
Sovereign indicates
that the source of
power of a country
is independent from
external influence.
Monarchs: Kings or
queens who inherit
their position from
their family, usually
passing it from
one generation to
the next within the
royal family.

2. Monarchies today
A monarchy is the type of government that is ruled by a
monarch. Kings and queens are called monarchs, who
exercise their sovereign power. Monarchies are usually
hereditary; typically, the eldest son of the ruling
monarch becomes the next king.
Today we have two types of monarchy:
a.

Absolute monarchy
In an absolute monarchy the monarch
has complete control in the making of laws,

200

Chapter 9.indd 200

08-04-2025 11:43:51

ensuring that they are followed and adjudicating when
they are not. Saudi Arabia is an example of an absolute
monarchy; here the king holds all power and governs
according to Islamic law. However, he appoints a council
that advises and assists him on governance; but he is not
bound by the council’s advice.
b.

Adjudicating:
Judging a case
when there is
a dispute

Constitutional monarchy
Let us consider an example of a different kind of monarchy.
The United Kingdom or Britain is also a monarchy. The
head of the state is the king or queen, but he or she has
only nominal power and the real power of the executive
is exercised by the prime minister. The legislative power is
exercised by the parliament.

Governance and Democracy
9 – From the Rulers to the Ruled: Types of Government

This means that all the laws are made by the elected
parliament, and executive power is exercised by the Council
of Ministers led by the prime minister. So while Britain has
a king, it really is, today, a parliamentary democracy. This
kind of monarchy is called a constitutional monarchy.

2. Theocracy
A theocracy is a form of government where the country is ruled
by the rules of religion and religious leaders.
Iran, whose full official name is ‘Islamic Republic of Iran’ has a
unique political system combining elements of both a theocratic
and democratic governance. Their constitution is based on the
fundamental principles of Islam, the country’s official religion.
The Supreme Leader, who has the ultimate authority over
the legislature, executive and judiciary, is selected by a group
of Islamic clerics and his term is for life. There are also an
elected president and a parliament that take care of everyday
governance. The intent of the republic is to establish a society
based on Islamic norms.
Other theocracies currently in existence include Afghanistan
and Vatican City.

3. Dictatorship

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

A dictatorship is a form of government in which one person,
or a small group possesses absolute power — they do not have
any limits imposed on them by a constitution or law. The 20th
century witnessed many examples of dictators who created
extremely difficult circumstances for the people; we will only
see two of them here.

202

Chapter 9.indd 202



Soon after Adolf Hitler was appointed
Chancellor of Germany in 1933, he
passed laws that gave him full power
and eliminated the opposition. He
was now a dictator. Convinced of the
superiority of his people, he believed
that Germany should rule the world
and dominate ‘inferior races’. He was
responsible for the killing of at least
Fig. 9.10. Caricature
six million Jews (this is known as the
of Adolf Hitler
‘Holocaust’) as well as hundreds of
thousands of Roma and other groups of people. In fact,
he was the cause for World War II in the years 1939–1945,

Idi Amin was a military dictator in
Uganda. He was directly responsible
for the merciless killing of thousands
of people. Many Indians whose
ancestors had migrated to Uganda a
few generations before were forced to
flee the country.

The Roma, or Romani people;
were originally nomads. Based
on their linguistic and cultural
characteristics, scholars have
determined that they originated
in India. They first settled in parts
of eastern Europe but have now
migrated to several countries of
the world.

Story of Shane
Shane lives in North Korea which has a set of defined rules
for his everyday living. He is currently serving in compulsory
military service in which he is expected to serve in the military
till the time government decides. There are also rules about
how his hair should be cut and the clothes he should wear.
He cannot access the global internet, and so is unaware of the
world outside his own country. The government watches his
every action closely and he is also expected to report about
anyone who tries breaking any of the defined rules. One day
he met a tourist who asked him, “Why do all of you have the
same haircut here?” To this Shane responded, “We all want to
explore new styles, but the government decides the way we
should keep our hair.”

4. Oligarchy

Political

The word ‘oligarchy’ is of Greek origin, where olígos means a few
and árkhō means to rule or command. It is a type of government
where a small, powerful group makes all the important decisions; usually they are wealthy families or influential people.
In some places in ancient Greece, aristocratic families ruled
as oligarchies. In modern times, political commentators have
observed that even some democracies show signs of oligarchy
when a small group of politicians and wealthy businesspeople
hold too much influence in governance.

Why Democracy Matters
These different types of governments show us that democracy
is not the only way in which countries are governed. But in
most countries, democracy is considered to be a better form
of government than others. Let us do a quick comparison to
understand this better.

Æ What do you find to be the most suitable form of
government?
You have read about different forms of government above and
how the form of government defines the lives of its citizens.
In the previous table, we could see that the representation of
people’s choices and rights varies across the different forms.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

In a genuine democracy, the people can lead their everyday lives
in the way they want. They can choose what to speak, what to
wear, what beliefs to follow, and how to express themselves. All
of this can be done in a democracy until and unless it harms
someone else’s rights.

206

Chapter 9.indd 206

In a democratic government, the people choose their
government. The government is accountable for protecting the
rights of its people and is responsible for providing basic needs
to its citizens. If the government does not perform its functions
properly, the people can change their representatives through
elections. This ensures that there is a constant check of what the
government does. Thus, the values and ideals of the government
in a democracy should focus on the well-being of all its people.
Our country is a democracy, and you can see many of the features
of a democracy in our lives every day. It is therefore no wonder
that more than half of the countries in the world have adopted
democracy and democratic forms of government.
It is important to keep in mind, however, that even democracies
have their problems. Issues such as corruption, wealth disparity,
excessive control by a few over democratic institutions, erosion
of the judiciary’s independence, manipulation of information

08-04-2025 11:43:55

channels, and several more, can cause hurdles in achieving the
ideals of democracy. What can we do as individuals, and as a
society, to remain vigilant and minimize these issues and hurdles?

Government plays an important role in running a country.
Different types of governments across the world have
different answers to the following questions: Who decides
“This is the government”? What are the parts of the
government and what do they do? Who or what is the
government working for? What values and ideals should
the government follow?
The most popular form of government in the world
today is democracy. Democratic governments across the
world have variations, including direct democracy and
representative democracy.
There are two types of representative
democracy — presidential and parliamentary democracy.
India is a parliamentary democracy.
Other types of government include monarchy, theocracy,
dictatorship and oligarchy.
Democracy matters, but there are serious challenges to
democracy that citizens need to remain vigilant about.

LET’S REMEMBER
Recall that in Grade 6, we saw the meaning of the word
‘constitution’ — a document that lays down the basic
principles and laws of a nation. In small groups of three, list
all the questions that come to your mind about a country’s
constitution.

210

Chapter 10.indd 210

08-04-2025 12:54:58

The Constitution of India is the document that many of the
important officials of our country pledge to uphold. The
president takes an oath to preserve, protect, and defend it. The
prime minister, council of ministers, and judges promise to
follow its provisions.

What Is a Constitution?
A simple answer is that it is a document that spells out a nation’s
basic principles and laws. It lays out:


the framework of the three organs of the government
(legislature, executive, and judiciary) and their roles and
responsibilities;



checks and balances amongst the three organs of government
to ensure fairness, responsibility and accountability;



the rights and duties of the citizens;



an outline of the long-term goals and aspirations of the
nation.

Why do we need a constitution?

Imagine that your school has reached the final tournament in
kabaddi at the state-level. The opponent is a strong team that
has won the tournament two years in a row. They are aiming
to win a third time, a hat-trick. The match is on, and a player
from your team has just got one of the players from the other
team ‘out’; then a dispute breaks out. The player from the other
team insists that she had already crossed into her team area
before your team player caught her. The referee has seen that
the player from the other team was indeed ‘out’. To settle the
dispute amicably, she pulls out a little official rulebook. The
team captains confer with the referee and look at the rules.
They then agree that the player was indeed ‘out’, and your
team has won the state-level trophy.

Discuss in your group what might have happened if there was
no official rulebook that the referee and the team captains
could refer to. What is required to ensure everyone agrees
to abide by the rulebook? What might happen if the team
captains did not agree to refer to the rulebook at all?
Think of a game that you play often and list the rules you
follow. Each group will then present their set of rules to the
rest of the class. Listen to each presentation, discuss the rules,
and work together to decide on a common set of rules for the
game. What challenges do you face in reaching a consensus
on rules that everyone agrees with?
What could be the ‘rulebook’ for a country? How would it be
made?
Our Constitution is something like a rulebook for the country.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

DON’T MISS OUT
Just as your textbook has many sections and chapters, the
Constitution of India has 25 parts and 12 schedules. Each
part has sections within it. It is the world’s largest written
constitution. When it came into effect, it had 22 Parts and 8
schedules. You don’t need to remember these numbers, but
can you guess why they have increased since 1950?
The basic rules and principles in a constitution determine what
kind of government will be there, how it will be formed, and
how it will function. This includes many principles we saw in
the previous chapter, such as how the legislature, executive
and judiciary are formed and how they work. A constitution
describes, for example, how laws are to be made and
implemented, who elects the executive, how the judiciary is
made, and what rights and duties individual citizens have.
Many constitutions, including the Indian Constitution, also state
the values and ideals the country is committed to — for instance,

212

Chapter 10.indd 212

08-04-2025 12:54:58

fact, it is these values and ideals that usually form the basis for
the laws and principles in a constitution.

also by wisdom, toleration, justice, and fairness to all;
and above all with a vision which may restore India to
her pristine glory, and give her a place of honour and
equality amongst the great nations of the world.
— Dr. Sachidananda Sinha,
President of the Constituent Assembly at the start of
the process of the writing of the Constitution
While India was struggling for independence from British
rule, it was necessary to start planning for how we would
govern ourselves. There were many important questions to be
answered in a large, culturally diverse and complex country like
India: What type of government should we have? What rules
and principles should guide us? Who should have the right to
vote? How should we decide on disputes?

To answer these and many other questions, a Constituent
Assembly was formed in 1946, initially with 389 members (later
reduced to 299 after the Partition of India), of which 15 were
women. These members represented India’s diverse regions,
professions, and social groups.

How was our Constitution developed?
The Indian Constitution was developed and written by the
Constituent Assembly over a period of almost three years. It
was formed on 9 December 1946, with its members elected by
the legislative assemblies of the provinces (whose members
had been, in turn, elected by the people). Dr. Rajendra Prasad
was the Chairman of the Constituent Assembly. The work was
completed on 26 November 1949, and the resulting document
was adopted as the Constitution of India on 26 January 1950,
which is why we celebrate this day annually as Republic Day.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

The initial text of the Constitution was prepared by a Drafting
Committee chaired by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, an eminent social
reformer and the first Law and Justice minister of independent
India (Fig. 10.3).

What Shaped and Influenced the Indian
Constitution?
While the Constitution was developed by the Constituent
Assembly, it had many influences. The experience, ideas and
ideals of the Indian freedom movement were a significant
influence. India’s civilisational heritage and culture also played
a key role. Useful learnings from constitutions of other countries
were also considered.

Many key ideals and values of the Indian freedom struggle
were enshrined in the Constitution. The Constitution was the
cornerstone for an independent India. A number of leaders of
India’s freedom movement were members of the Constituent
Assembly and, therefore, carried their experience and ideas
from the freedom struggle to the Constitution.
Some of these values and ideals are: equality of all, justice
for all, freedom, fraternity,
preservation of India’s cultural
heritage, and the idea of using
the Constitution as a tool for
and means of achieving these
values and ideals.
The experience and learnings
from the freedom struggle also
provided answers to many of
the ‘how’ and ‘what’ questions:

India’s civilisational heritage and history

216

Chapter 10.indd 216

LET’S REMEMBER
In the chapter on “Unity in Diversity, or ‘Many in the One’ ”
in Grade 6, we studied what makes India one country and the
underlying unity that embraces the diversity.
This idea of India being one country is embedded in the
Constitution.
Some fundamental principles are embedded in our
culture — acceptance of the idea that people could have different
points of view, Nature as sacred, the pursuit of learning and
knowledge, respect for women, the concepts of vasudhaiva
kutumbakam (“the world is one family”) and sarve bhavantu

08-04-2025 12:54:59

sukhinah (an invocation for the well-being of all creatures). All
these principles find a place in our Constitution though you
might find them expressed a little differently.

LET’S REMEMBER
Earlier, we described various types of governance systems that
we experimented within India — from the janapadas, sanghas,
rulers and their councils, Kauṭilya’s concept of saptānga,
rājadharma and so on. On the whole, there has been a great
emphasis on the duties and role of the people in governance.
It was, therefore, quite natural that the Constitution makers would
incorporate these ideas of our civilisational heritage into our
Constitution — ‘Fundamental Duties’, for instance, are part of it.

In addition, in the Indian tradition
of ā no bhadrāh kratavo yantu
viśhwatah — “Let noble thoughts
come to me from every side” — the
Constitution makers studied the
constitutions of France, USA,
UK, Ireland, Australia, and other
countries that have a democratic
system, to explore their usefulness
for our context. For example,
the ideals of ‘liberty, equality,
fraternity’ were adopted from
France’s
constitution
(which
enshrined them from the French
Revolution of 1789); the idea of the
Directive Principles of State Policy
(which we will study shortly) was Fig. 10.5. This ‘Declaration of the Rights of Man
inspired by the Irish Constitution; and of the Citizen’, which focused on equality,
liberty and justice for all, was formulated
and the American Constitution during the 1789 French Revolution. It helped the

Key Features of the Constitution of India
Before we get acquainted with the main features of the
Constitution, let us revisit some of the concepts we saw in Grade 6.

LET’S REMEMBER
Æ There are three organs of government — legislature,
executive and judiciary — and the ‘separation of powers’
is essential to their effective working.
Æ The legislature makes the laws.
Æ The law is implemented by the executive, which is headed
by the prime minister.
Æ The judiciary ensures that all laws made are in accordance
with the Constitution. It also decides whether a law has
been broken and what punishment is necessary.
Æ We have a three-tier system of government — central,
state and local (Panchayati raj system).

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

Æ Some functions and responsibilities are reserved for the
central government, and others are assigned to the state
government.

220

Chapter 10.indd 220

The Constitution addresses these points comprehensively.
It clearly defines the roles, functions, responsibilities, and
accountability measures for each organ of government. The
electoral system has been laid down to ensure that every eligible
citizen of the country is enabled to vote.
Other core aspects of the Constitution are the Fundamental
Duties, Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State
Policy. The infographic (Fig. 10.14) provides us with examples
of a few of the Fundamental Duties and Rights (which are listed
in full in the beginning of all NCERT textbooks). The Directive
Principles of State Policy (DPSP, as they are popularly called)
represent the essence of the social and economic vision that
the framers of the Constitution had for India. The examples we
present in the infographic illustrate the principles they wanted
governance to follow.

08-04-2025 12:55:02

DON’T MISS OUT
Directive Principles are goals that the government should try
to achieve. They reflect the direction they wished the country
take to make India better for all; for example, everybody in
the country must have a good standard of living. But if the
government does not make efforts to follow this, one cannot
go to a judge and complain about it. The DPSP are more like
guidelines than strict rules. Fundamental Rights, on the other
hand are promises that must be kept. If someone treats you
unfairly because of who you are, you can actually go to court
and the judge can help you.
The people who wrote our Constitution created this system on
purpose. They wanted some rights that could be demanded
immediately (Fundamental Rights) and some bigger goals
(Directive Principles) that might take time to achieve as our
country progressed.

LET’S EXPLORE

Sir, the women of India are happy to step into their rightful
heritage of complete equality with men in all spheres of
life and activity. I say so because I am convinced that
this is no new concept which has been postulated for
the purposes of this Constitution, but is an ideal that has
long been cherished by India, though social conditions
for some time had tragically debased it in practice. This
Constitution affirms that ideal and gives the solemn
assurance that the rights of women in law will be wholly
honoured in the Indian Republic.

The Constitution is a Living Document
Our Constitution makers realised that a need for new laws
and rules would emerge over time. For example, ‘Part IV-A:
Fundamental Duties’ was added in 1976. However, we must
remember that any changes (called ‘amendments’) to the
Constitution are rigorously debated in the Parliament before they
are accepted. Some require a debate in legislative assemblies as
well. Many times, opinions are sought from the general public.
Some changes can also be initiated by popular movements.

Æ

There was a time when people were not allowed to fly
the national flag at their homes. This changed in 2004
when a citizen felt it was his right to express pride in his
country and challenged the rule in court. The Supreme
Court agreed, saying that flying the flag is part of the
Fundamental Right to Freedom of Expression. We can
now fly the tricolour with pride, keeping in mind that it
should never be dishonoured.

Æ

We studied the Panchayati Raj System in Grade 6. This was
not a part of the original Constitution; it was integrated in
it in 1992 with the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act.

Æ

Can you find out the amendments made to the Constitution
in the past ten years?

The government also creates opportunities for people to
provide feedback on proposed laws or changes in rules. See the
highlighted portion on the next page.  

DON’T MISS OUT
The Indian Constitution is not just a legal document but also a
work of art. Calligrapher Prem Behari Narain Raizada wrote
its text by hand, while Nandalal Bose and his team illustrated
its pages with scenes from Indian history, from Mohenjo-daro
to the freedom movement (see Figs. 10.6 to 10.13).

The Constitution’s core values are the guiding principles for
policies and decision-making, which the government is expected
to follow. Citizens are also expected to practise them to the best
of their ability. These guiding values are present across the
Constitution, but their essence is written in the Preamble. So, let

System:

goods and

money.
Money:
the common
tool that
everybody

to make
or receive
payments in
exchange for
goods and
services.
Transaction:
a piece of
business
that is done
between
people,
especially an
act of buying
or selling.

People exchanged goods or services for other goods and
services. This system is called the barter system. How did
this work? Suppose you need a pencil and have an extra
eraser. Meanwhile, your classmate forgot to bring their
eraser but has an extra pencil. You could exchange your
extra eraser for the extra pencil that your classmate has.
Wouldn’t this satisfy your and the classmate’s needs? This
is how the barter system works.
Today, we use coins and notes to buy and sell things. People
also use their mobile phones and computers for such
transactions.
The barter system was the earliest form of exchange. There
is a lot of evidence of it from around the world. People
used commodities such as cowrie shells, salt, tea, tobacco,
cloth, cattle (cows, goats, horses, sheep), seeds, etc.

Why Do we Need Money?
LET’S EXPLORE
Imagine that you are a
farmer and that people
use a barter system where
you live. You need a whole
variety of things — a pair
of new shoes, a sweater,
and medicines for your
grandmother. But you only
have an ox that you can

For one, you would have to
find someone who needed an
ox. Now, swapping your ox for
a pair of shoes would hardly be a fair exchange! You may have
had to go through a series of exchanges — for example, find
someone to exchange your ox
for several bags of wheat. You
would then have to transport
all that wheat to several
places; first, find someone
willing to exchange a part of
the wheat for shoes, another
person for the sweater, and
yet another for the medicines.

spare. How would you be
able to exchange the ox for
all the different things you
need from different people or
places? What difficulties are
you likely to face?

231

Chapter 11.indd 231

08-04-2025 12:58:32

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

In each of these cases, a discussion would take place to arrive
at the fair amount of wheat that you could exchange for shoes
or for the sweater.

You would have to take the
leftover bags of wheat and find
a place to store them safely.
The next time you needed
something, you would have to
carry the bags of wheat with
you again!

THINK ABOUT IT
What are the different types of difficulties you encountered
in the situation above?

In the farmer’s story, imagine he finds someone who
is willing to trade a pair of new shoes, a sweater, and

232

Chapter 11.indd 232

08-04-2025 12:58:33

Just like the farmer, people who depended on the barter
system would face many problems in making an exchange
in their everyday lives. They would have to find someone
who wants the exact item that they want to give, and in
return are also able to offer exactly what the other party
wants. This scenario is called double coincidence of wants.
Even if there are two people who want each other’s goods
and are also willing to make an exchange, other issues
could arise — in what proportion should the two goods be
exchanged? In such cases, it becomes difficult to compare
the value of one good against another. If one of the people
feels that the exchange is disadvantageous, they would not
be interested in the exchange. This is because there is no
common standard measure of value.

Similarly, you cannot exchange only a part of the ox for
a sweater; this is the problem of divisibility. Taking the
ox everywhere is a problem and leads to the problem of
portability. You solved part of the problem by exchanging

Although
money
has
replaced
traditional
barter systems all around
the world, there are some
that still exist today! One
of them is the Junbeel
Mela (jun means moon
in Assamese and beel
means wetland), a threeFig. 11.3
day annual socio-cultural
fair at Junbeel in Morigaon district of Assam. Interestingly,
the mela begins with the Agni Puja or worship of fire, a
prayer for universal wellbeing.
Beginning in the 15th
century, the chiefs of
the Tiwa, Karbi, Khasi,
and
Jaintia
tribal
communities of Assam
and Meghalaya would
gather every year to
discuss political issues
and to maintain friendly
Fig. 11.4
relationships. Members of
these communities began to gather around this event and
soon it turned into a fair, where people would bring their
produce and began exchanging them among each other.

LET’S EXPLORE
The illustrations above show you some of the ways in which
people practise barter today. Have you observed similar
practices in your locality? What are the types of experiences
people have in this process?

Basic Functions of Money

236

Chapter 11.indd 236

It is said that “necessity is the mother of invention.” As the
types and numbers of things that were being exchanged
grew, and the distances across which barter was beginning
to take place became longer, it became clear that there was a
need for a different system. A common medium of exchange
would make trade easier and so,
money came into existence. As more
and more people began to use it for
transactions — buying and selling
goods and services — it became the
accepted method of payment.

Fig. 11.8

As we saw in the farmer’s story
above, he could not store the wheat
for long as it would rot or get eaten
by rats.

08-04-2025 12:58:36

If the farmer uses money instead of wheat as a medium of
exchange, he can keep the money for a longer time and use
it for making purchases later. So, money acts as a store of
value that can be used later. Isn’t it fascinating!
Money also serves as a common denomination that
measures the value of goods and services, and enables the
comparison of goods and services in terms of their prices.
For example, your parents pay money to the shopkeepers
in exchange for various products. This money is used by the
shopkeepers to pay salaries to their workers. The workers
use the same medium to buy everyday essentials and other
goods, pay their children’s school fees, etc.

Suppose you need to buy a book. You have ₹50 in your
pocket. You visit the bookshop in your neighbourhood
where the shopkeeper tells you that the book is worth ₹100.
What options do you have to buy the book today? Will you
request the shopkeeper to allow you to make the rest of the
payment later?

The fact that money is accepted as a way of making
deferred payments makes money a standard of deferred
payment.

The Journey of Money
LET’S EXPLORE
Look at the timeline given below. What are the changes in
money that you observe?

Coinage
As you can see from the timeline, coins were among the
earliest forms of money. During those times, rulers would
issue coins that were used by the citizens of their respective
kingdoms for transactions. So different kingdoms would
have their own coinage. The minting and issue of coins was
controlled entirely by the rulers. Over time, the coins of
powerful rulers were accepted across various kingdoms and
not just their own. This facilitated trade across geographies.

Alloy:
A metal
made by
combining
two or
more
metallic
elements.
This makes
the coin
strong.

The coins were made from precious metals like gold, silver,
and copper or their alloys. They were called kārṣhāpaṇas
or paṇas. They had symbols punched on them called rūpas.

Minting:
The process
of producing
coins. A mint
refers to a
manufacturing
facility that
produces coins
that are used
as a nation’s
currency.

Does this word sound familiar to a word we use for money
today in India?

DON’T MISS OUT
 Is it not interesting that variations of the word ‘paṇa’
continue to be used in Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam as
paṇaṁ and in Kannada as ‘haṇa’ for money?
 Alloys of silver and copper were used to mint coins. The
coins we use today are also alloys consisting largely of
iron. They contain other materials like chromium, silicon,
and carbon in precise proportions. You will learn more
about alloys in your science lessons.

In ancient times, the two sides of the coins — the head
(obverse) and the tail (reverse) — had different kinds of
symbols and motifs engraved on them. These included
nature motifs like animals, trees and hills, and those of
kings or queens, and deities.
For example, the coins of the Chalukyas had a Varaha image
(avatar of Viṣhṇu) on one side and decorated three-tiered
parasol on the other.

The use of coinage helped boost India’s maritime trade with
the world. For example, they were found in parts of Kerala
and Tamil Nadu. This throws light on the trading activities
of southern India with the rest of the world. Based on this
finding, scholars conclude that the trade was in favour of
India.

Organise yourselves into groups of five students each. Take
up a group project to collect old coins from family members,
neighbours, shopkeepers, and so on. Document their various
features — what are they made of, what is the year inscribed

sides of the coins. What can you guess from your observations?
How would you know if your guesses are true?

While the barter system used non-metallic money as
discussed above, coinage, that is metallic money, gave way
to other forms of money!

Paper Money
What do you think happened as coins began to be used for all
types of exchanges, whether to buy vegetables or to buy some
land? What problems could have come up?

As you may have imagined, it became difficult to carry
a large number of coins. Storing the coins also became a
problem. The search for a more suitable alternative ended

controls the issue of currency. It is not legal for anybody
other than the RBI to issue currency.

New Forms of Money
As time has progressed and technology has advanced, other
forms of money have come to be used today. Let’s look at
some of them.

Apart from tangible forms of money such as coins and
paper notes, money has taken intangible forms that we
cannot touch and feel. This is called digital money which is
in electronic form. Have you observed other people around
you making or receiving payments without using coins and
notes? Different payment methods like debit cards, credit
cards, net banking, UPI (Unified Payments Interface), etc.,
are also used for transactions. These mediums directly
transfer money from one person’s bank account into
another. You will learn more about the modern methods of
monetary transactions later.

What is a Market?
A place where people buy and sell goods is called a market.
It is also known as bazaar, haat (in Hindi), and mārukatté
(in Kannada). What is it called in your region? This can
be at a physical place or, as is becoming popular today,
online. Goods and services become available to individuals,
households, and businesses through markets. For a long
time, people have relied on markets to fulfil their needs
and wants for goods and services. In addition, markets
connect people, traditions, and ideas.
Let’s see an example of a market from 16th century India.

The Hampi Bazaar in Karnataka was one of the prosperous
markets in the Vijayanagara Empire which was the centre
of flourishing trade. The bazaar was located opposite the
Virupaksha temple. The sheer abundance and prosperity
of the city have been described in many foreign accounts.
The famous Portuguese traveller, Domingos Paes, called
Hampi “the best-provided city in the world” due to the
wide variety of products traded in the market— grains,
seeds, milk, oil, silk, animals like cows, rabbits, horses, and
even birds like quails and partridges. Another Portuguese
traveller, Fernao Nuniz, wrote about the bazaar, “There
were craftsmen, also, working in their streets, so that you

find all kinds of rubies and diamonds and pearls, with

there should be an abundance of everything therein.”

Certain features are required for places to be called
markets. As you observed in the figure 12.2 (on introductory
big spread page number 248) every market has a buyer
and a seller. They both need to agree on a price at which
the transaction would take place. Price is an important
feature in completing a transaction.

an acceptable price. What type of negotiation and bargaining
took place in your skit?

THINK ABOUT IT
Can you think of a type of market where negotiation is less
common and why?

Prices and Markets
What happens when there are many buyers and sellers in the
market? How do prices respond to how buyers and sellers
interact in the market?
In the figure given below, the seller wants to sell the guavas at
₹80 per kg. However, buyers may not be willing to buy at that
price. If a buyer finds the price very high, he will ask for a price
that he is willing to pay. The seller may not be willing to sell at the
price offered by the buyer because it would not be profitable for
him. The buyer and seller negotiate until a mutually agreeable
price is reached. The transaction can then be completed. If such
a point is not reached, i.e. the point where the buyer and the
seller agree on a price, the transaction may not take place.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

Let’s see some scenarios below to understand this.

Over time the price of guavas is fixed at one that is just

seller!

Learning from all three scenarios, the seller can assess
approximately what quantity of guavas are needed by the
buyers and offer that quantity in the market in future.
Over time, the amount of goods offered by the sellers and the
amount required by the buyers help determine the price of
the goods that is just right, high enough for the seller, and low
enough for the buyer.

A physical market is where buyers can meet the seller physically,
and purchase goods or services in exchange for money. This is
the most common type of market. It includes weekly markets and
haats where vendors sell vegetables, other essential items, and
handicraft items lined up on a cart. Local markets with shops
and buzzing with vendors selling street food, knick-knacks, and
so on are also physical markets. There are also multi-storey
buildings, i.e., malls in cities and towns spanning large areas
with stores inside.
Today buyers and sellers need not necessarily meet in person
to engage in a transaction. They can transact from a convenient
location even thousands of kilometres away from each other.
They can use shopping applications (apps) or
websites on a phone or a computer. These apps
or websites are created by businesses that make
available a wide variety of goods and services. We
will read about how this works in a section below.
One can buy goods ranging from books, clothes,
furniture, and grocery items to electronic items
like TVs, mobile phones, and laptops, and get
them delivered to their doorstep. Manufacturers
can also buy components online to be used as
inputs for production of goods. Apart from goods, one
can also avail of services like online classes without having
to step outside the home. Payments for such services can also
be made online.



What do you think are the pros and cons of online and
physical shopping respectively? Explore this question from
the point of view of both, sellers and buyers.



Some services require in-person contact like tailoring and
cannot be provided online. Can you suggest other services
where physical markets are needed?

There are other types of markets that do not transact goods and
services. One of them is the share or stock market.
Ask your family members, teachers, or members in your
community about it. We will explore these concepts later in the
year.

Domestic and international markets
A market where goods and services are bought and sold within
the geographical boundaries of the country is called a domestic
market. For example, to print this book, paper was procured
from big paper mills located all over India. The transaction
between the buyer and the seller took place within the country.
International markets exist outside a nation’s boundary; the
sellers in one country export their products to another country,
or the buyers in one country import products produced in
another country. Thus, trade occurs across borders of countries.

Consumer

In the case of physical markets,
wholesalers buy goods in large
quantities from the producer or
manufacturer of the product.
For example, grains, vegetables,
and fruits are bought by
wholesalers directly from the
farms. The produce is then
stored in large warehouses
called godowns. In the case of
perishables, the warehouses

like chemicals, electronic items and components, construction
materials, automotive parts, etc.

The wholesalers supply goods to the shops and stores located
near households. These shopkeepers are called retailers. They
sell goods to final consumers like us. Unlike wholesalers,
retailers sell in smaller quantities, and the products are meant
for consumption rather than resale. Retail stores also exist for
services like salons, movie theatres, and restaurants. Retailers

Fig. 12.17. Johari Bazaar, Jaipur (gems and jewellery)

help increase the availability of goods and services to households.
In some cases, it may be difficult for wholesalers to reach a
large number of retailers because of distances and terrains.
Distributors help to bridge this gap. Do you remember the
middlemen for milk in the AMUL story from Grade 6?

However, the distribution channel is different in the case of
online markets. Here manufacturers send bulk quantities
of their products to the warehouse of the business that sells
through online apps. Consumers buy the product from the
online option (website or mobile application). These businesses
are called aggregators. The aggregator then packs the products
and delivers them to the online buyer.

Let’s explore the chain of supply
in physical markets for the textile
market in Surat, Gujarat — Asia’s
oldest textile market, and the city
famously known as a textile hub.

260

Chapter 12.indd 260

The Surat textile market consists
of thousands of factories manufacturing cotton and synthetic
textiles. In the case of cotton
textiles, raw cotton is received here
through cotton mandī s from nearby
states like Maharashtra, as well as
from other parts of Gujarat. It is
transformed into finished fabric or
garments after processing at various
stages — weaving on power looms,
dyeing in processing units and so on.
The product moves from one stage
to another through markets — for
woven fabric, for dyed fabric, and
for finished products (sarees, or
ready-made garments, for example).

Fig. 12.22.

4/8/2025 11:21:58 AM

The finished product from the fabric is traded by the
manufacturing units in the wholesale market. The wholesalers
are an important channel of supply as they oversee the
distribution of products to small shopkeepers and big retail
stores across the country and internationally. They also assess
how much product is required by retailers. This helps maintain
the stock of products with the manufacturers and ensures an
uninterrupted supply of products to the end consumers.

Æ Apart from textiles, Surat is home to the largest diamond
industry in the world. Approximately 1.5 million artisans
are involved in activities like cutting and polishing
diamonds on a gigantic scale. Trade flourished here from
the 16th century onwards. The city’s location on the west
coast led to the setting up of ports and road networks that
continue to be important today. Communities of expert
artisans and skilled persons have lived here for centuries;
their skills have been passed on over generations making
it a flourishing city.

The Role of Markets in People’s Lives
As we can see from the sections above, markets play an important
role in the economic life of the people. It facilitates transactions
between producers and consumers. It helps individuals,
households and businesses access goods and services that they
need and cannot produce themselves.

THINK ABOUT IT
We have discussed different dimensions of markets. Can we
imagine what life might be like without markets? What would
happen if farmers did not bring rice, wheat, dal, vegetables
and fruits to the market? What would happen if the producers
of cloth in Surat could not procure inputs like cotton from
markets?
In this section, we will explore a few other dimensions of the
role of markets.
Aakriti is a professional artist who creates oil paintings on
canvas. Her paintings are appreciated, but she finds it difficult to
find buyers. She is worried about where to sell the paintings and
what price she should offer them for. Unlike the case of guavas,
there are fewer local buyers and sellers for artwork.
Can you think of other products which do not have a ready
market? How does it affect those willing to buy or sell? What
are the different ways in which artists can find buyers for their
work today?

LET’S EXPLORE
Consumers prefer to buy refrigerators that use less
electricity. When a large number of consumers begin to ask
for refrigerators that use less electricity, what do you think
happens in the network you saw in Fig. 12.11?

How markets benefit society

263

Chapter 12.indd 263

4/8/2025 11:21:58 AM

The producers get an indication as to what consumers would
buy. They produce refrigerators which use less electricity. This
benefits society through the production of energy-efficient
refrigerators.
Although buying and selling is an economic activity that
involves monetary exchange, interactions in the markets often
move beyond just enquiring about the product or service or
negotiations between parties.
Often, a relationship develops between buyers and sellers
that continues even across generations. Some families have
long-lasting trusted relationships with their tailor, jeweller, and
doctor over decades. Many families in India maintain an account
with the local grocer that is settled at the end of the month.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1

So, while the primary role of the market is to promote economic
activities, it also has non-economic significance in many
people’s lives.

Mother’s Market, Ima Keithal in the Meitei language of
Manipur, is a unique market in Imphal. About 3000 women
own and run all the shops in this market. They sell vegetables,
clothes including traditional Manipuri attire, hand-loom and
handicrafts, local produce, and daily essentials that people in
the city and the surrounding areas require. On one hand, the
market provides employment, becoming an important source of
income for thousands of families; on the other hand, the market
is a melting pot of cultures. People from different communities
come together to exchange ideas and enjoy shared traditions.

There are many traditions followed
even today that go beyond just buying
and selling. In south India, the sellers
of haldi and kumkum (turmeric and
vermilion) give a small quantity of
haldi and kumkum separately, at no
charge, as a mark of auspiciousness
and good wishes to the buyer.

Have you observed any such practices in your community or
neighbourhood? Describe the practice as a drawing or in a
short paragraph.

Government’s Role in the Market

Controlling prices for protecting buyers
and sellers
The government controls the prices of certain goods. For
example, it sets the maximum price that the seller can charge.
Several essential goods and services, such as lifesaving drugs,
have an upper limit on their prices. Another instance is where
the government sets the minimum price at which essential
agricultural products like wheat, paddy and maize can be sold.
This ensures that farmers do not incur losses. The government
also sets minimum wages for work done by employees so that
employers make fair payments to them.

Economic Life Around Us
12 – Understanding Markets

Markets function through interactions of demand from buyers
and supply by sellers. However, there are some situations in
which this may not work very well. The government plays
a crucial role in such situations. It monitors the interaction
between consumers and producers, and fair determination
of price.

265

4/8/2025 11:22:01 AM

However, the government needs to carefully implement such
price limits. If the price is too low, producers would not have
any motivation to produce. If the prices are too high, consumers
would be disadvantaged.

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ Onions are an important part of the cuisine in most parts
of India. In some seasons, the supply of onions comes
down in the market. What do you think happens to the
price of onions when this happens?
Æ What will happen if the people supplying onions do not
bring the required quantities to the market? What do you
think the government should do in this situation?

Ensuring quality and safety standards

266

Chapter 12.indd 266

The government has a role in ensuring the welfare of consumers
and protecting them from unfair practices. The government
ensures that manufacturers follow the required quality and
safety standards while producing goods and delivering services.
For instance, pharmaceutical companies manufacture medicines
for treating diseases. The government sets procedures for
approvals of medicines and conducts sample testing to check if
the produced drug meets standards of quality. These regulations
ensure the quality and safety of the drugs so that there is no risk
to the consumers’ health.

Mitigating the external effects of markets
Markets sometimes have significant effects beyond the selling
and buying. For example, the markets for certain goods require
production in factories that could pollute the environment.
The government plays a crucial role in understanding and
controlling such effects of markets. For example, what happens
when the manufacturing of certain items, like single-use plastics,
pollutes the environment and poses health risks to consumers?
In such cases, the government intervenes by implementing strict
regulations to mitigate these negative effects.

4/8/2025 11:22:01 AM

Similarly, the government puts in place systems to monitor the
weights and measures of the packaged products to check the net
quantity contained in the package.

THINK ABOUT IT
The practice of rulers protecting consumers is not a
phenomenon of modern India. Kauṭilya’s Arthaśhāstra
includes instructions for the traders trading in clarified butter
(ghee). It mentions that buyers shall be given 1 / 50 part more as
mānasrāva to compensate for the reduction in quantity owing
to (the ghee)…sticking to the measuring can.
Governments make rules to ensure markets work fairly and
consumers are not exploited. However, too many rules can make
it difficult for markets to function properly.

Providing public goods

THINK ABOUT IT


What are the other areas where you can see the government
being involved in the markets?

Are there areas where government intervention needs to
be reduced? Discuss with family or relatives.

How can consumers assess the quality of
products and services?
Markets enable access to a wide variety of goods and services to
consumers. How will consumers decide what they would like to
buy?

Producers make and sell goods and services to be able to make
a profit. However, there are some goods and services that
producers do not expect to make a profit on; for example, public
parks, roads, policing, and so on. In addition, you read about
the rights that citizens have to certain welfare provisions in a
previous chapter. So, the government provides these public
goods and services.

Did you notice the FSSAI logo?
FSSAI means Food Safety & Standards Authority
of India and its symbol on the food packets and
cartons indicates that food has been tested by
the government and is safe to consume.
Government agencies provide such certifications that help
buyers to assess product quality. Their presence on the product
or its package confirms that the product fulfills the minimum
quality standards.



Just like FSSAI, there is Indian Standards
Institution (ISI) Mark issued by the Bureau of
India Standards (BIS). This symbol is generally
present on electrical appliances, construction
materials, automotive tires, paper, etc. This
ensures quality and that the product is safe to use.



Similarly, AGMARK (Ag for agriculture) is the certification
mark for agricultural products like vegetables, fruits,
cereals, pulses, spices, honey, etc.



Electronics items like TVs, laptops, air
conditioners, etc. have BEE STAR rating. BEE
stands for Bureau of Energy Efficiency. These
ratings are printed on the product package as
stars. Higher stars indicate that the appliance
uses less energy and electricity. This is good for consumers
as the electricity bill would be lesser and good for the
environment as well.

LET’S EXPLORE
Check out the BEE Star labels on the electronic devices in your
home and make a chart of all the devices in an increasing order
of their energy efficiency.
On the other hand, purchase decisions of buyers are influenced
by the reputation of the product. This is built through word
of mouth. Have your family members bought some product
because their friends or relatives suggested it to them?

Markets facilitate exchange between buyers and sellers at a
mutually agreed price which is determined by the demand
from buyers and supply by sellers.

Æ

Markets have a chain of participants like manufacturers,
wholesalers, distributors and retailers that enables supply
of goods to the final consumers.

The government plays a regulatory role in the markets
to promote quality standards for products and services
and fair practices in the market. However, consumers can
also assess the quality of products and services through
certification marks on the products from government

Look at the real life situation that a retail seller of vegetables
encountered: A family came to shop for vegetables. The
price of beans that the seller on the cart was offering was
₹30 / kg. The lady started to bargain with the seller to bring
the price down to ₹25 / kg. The seller protested and refused
to sell at that price saying he would make a loss at that price.
The lady walks away. The family then goes to a super bazaar
nearby. They buy vegetables in the super bazaar where they
pay ₹40 / kg for the beans that is neatly packed in a plastic
bag. What are the reasons that the family does this? Are
there factors that affect buying and selling which are not
