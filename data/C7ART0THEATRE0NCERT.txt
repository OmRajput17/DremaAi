UNDERSTANDING EMOTIONS
Emotions have always played a very important role in our lives. Since
time immemorial, we have tried to understand the depth of what, why
and how emotions exist in our lives.
As this Sanskrit line from Bharata’s Natyashastra says —

एवंं रसााश्र्च भाावााश्र्च नााटकेे स्मृृताःः ।
  ा सि द्धि मुुत्ताामााम्् ।। 125 ।।
य एवमेेताान्् जाानााति  स गच्छेेेत्मा
Evam Rasāśca Bhāvāśca Nāțake Smṛtāḥ
Ya Evametān Jānāti Sa Gacchet Siddhimuttamām
— Natyashastra, Bharata Muni (Ch. VII)
In the performance of a play, feelings, sentiments, mood,
thoughts and state of mind need to be created. Only when
one knows this well, the play will attain success.

You will learn
 Emotions in different intensities.
 Lokadharmi and Natyadharmi — realistic and stylised.
 Representation in ancient architecture.

It implies emotions are the most important thing
to connect not just for the audience, but people in
general. It is, therefore, crucial to understand how
emotions work in order to make the right connections
and live a positive life. Let us do a quick recap of what
we have learnt so far.

In the previous year, we
discussed about the concept of —



Experiencing two or more
emotions in a situation.



Your feelings being different
from your friends, in the same
situation.



Navarasa — Indian view on
emotions.



Tragedy-Comedy — Greek
view on emotions.



Game of Hot Seat — Combines
storytelling and emotional
expression.

Based on the concepts we already discussed, we
shall now go deeper into understanding and expressing
emotions. As we have already learnt, Bharata Muni
researched and analysed to conclude that there are
eight predominant emotional experiences, and the
ninth was added later making it the Navarasa. With
our own little research and understanding, we can
add to this knowledge. Sounds exciting?

Here is an example to demonstrate this —

Rasa — Roudra (Anger)
Different levels
Mild Anger

Very Angry

Rage

To start with, let us pick one Rasa.
Now, list (or draw) different levels of that Rasa
(emotion)

Here we are looking
at different levels
of intensity of
each emotion. To
understand this better,
let us play a game
that will let you think
about each emotion, as
you have fun with your
friends.

Intensity is the
measurable
quality or degree
of a property or
condition.

ACTIVITY 1.1: EMOTIONAL CORNERS
Every corner of the room is assigned different
emotions and anyone who stands in that corner
has to express that emotion — in speech, facial
expression and body language. Placards or posters
are placed at different places to identify emotions.
It starts with all children standing at the centre of
the room. Play a trial round to understand better.

Since, we are all familiar with the various emotions,
let us start working on specific details of each emotion.
Just like the example given on page 6 — where anger
has been shown in three levels — pick another emotion,
discuss in class about its various levels and make
placards accordingly. You can even add a fourth level if
you can identify it. Here is another example —

Now we come to the actual part!

Now, with new names to the corners, everyone can
stand in the centre and play the game using speech,
action and expression. Repeat the same for each emotion.
You can try doing it without voice. It will help in
focusing on expression and body language. You can
skip action to focus only on voice and expression. All
variations with all emotions can be explored in class.

EMOTION: HAPPINESS

Note to the Teacher: It is important to have a discussion
among the children regarding the levels of each emotion.
The children have to think and arrive at different levels
each time. It may not be the same for every batch or class.
Each group of children can arrive at different names and
levels. There is no correct or wrong answer here.
The teacher is advised not to give the names of
variable intensities to children, but only help and
support them in arriving at the final names
of levels.

ADVANCED
Now that you all have mastered the names and varying intensities of each
emotion, let’s try putting it in the form of a story. Now, the corners will
only have names of levels. It could be the level of any emotion depending
on the situation of the story.
Example: Once upon a time there was a queen who ruled over a huge
province in India. She fought many battles and protected her people
bravely (calls out Veera rasa, L3. The rest of the children go to
L3 and emote it). One day, two children came
to her and said they can defeat her easily
(calls out — Adbhuta rasa, L2. The children go
to L2 and emote it). She laughs and agrees to the
challenge (Hasya rasa, L1).
And so, it goes on. Everyone can take
turns in narrating stories. They can either
be given time to prepare or have them say
it spontaneously. They can also narrate
popular stories of the Panchatantra
or Puranas.
Note to the Teacher: It is highly beneficial to ask each child to write the three or four
levels of emotion as they perceive. Each child would have their own experience
that would determine this. It is important to have every child think on their
own (for better self-awareness) and actively participate in the group (for peer
validation). Emphasising the importance of voice and volume to convey
emotions will help in better communication, and enable children with
visual impairment to connect better.

others intently, before doing this exercise. You can
also include actions (body language) and sound

What are these styles of expression? Is acting and
performance also categorised into different styles?
What is it based on? Read on, to get all your answers.

STYLES OF ACTING

< Japan in
South-East Asia

Acting has been explored by many experts and artists,
across the world for many centuries. The style of
performance usually depends on their local culture.
But there are few styles that go beyond this and are
universally followed, even to this day. Some of the
ancient cultures that created their own styles are
mentioned on the right.
In the pictures on the right, do you see the variety in
the styles of presentation? Each one looks completely
different from the other. You see variety in costume,
properties, music, dialogues and even the kind of
stories they tell. With so much variety, how do we find
styles that can be applied universally, no matter where
it is performed? This is achieved by creating styles that
are more natural and closer to real life. Brecht style and
method acting are some examples.
Now, look at the these pictures and try to identify the
country or the culture. It is difficult, right? It could be any
part of the world, but mostly set in the present context.
So, these styles are very different when compared to
the previous set of culture-based style. These styles are
based on techniques of acting and direction that can be
applied to any script or story. You will learn in detail
about these styles in the upcoming grades.

years ago we still use it today as it is still relevant!
The level of detail and expertise in his work
Natyashastra is astonishing.
The two styles as defined by Bharata Muni are
Natya Dharmi and Loka Dharmi.

Do we have names for these? Who gave them their
names?

Natya Dharmi — bigger, exaggerated movement,
over-the-top expressions, loud voice, elaborate
bright costume and make up, lots of jewellery, and
accessories

As we studied in Grade 6, more than 2500 years
ago, Bharata Muni, a great sage from India studied,
researched and analysed the performing arts and
defined all these elements. Though it was written 2500

Loka Dharmi — perform like in real life. Actions,
expressions, costume are all natural and resemble
reality. It appears like the situation is naturally
happening on stage and not acting.

Identify Which of These is Natural (Loka Dharmi) and Which of
These is Exaggerated (Natya Dharmi)

Here is the
actual stanza from
the Natyashastra
that talks about
natural
and
stylised acting.

लोोकधर्मीी नााट्यधर्मीी धर्मीीति  तुु द्वि वि धाःः  स्मृृतःः ।

Meaning: Practice

This activity is done in order to get familiar with
the two styles of acting. Keep a few chits prepared
with simple actions written on each one.

Example: Walking on the road with many
potholes, taking a gift out of the bag, eating your
favourite chocolate.

where you have seen
stylised acting (movies,

BASIC
A set of folded chits are kept on a table. Each child picks up one chit. Reads
the action written on it. The child gets to choose if it wants to do the action
in a natural style or stylised. All children get a chance to try realistic acting,
stylised acting or both!

ADVANCED
Another set of chits is kept alongside this set of actions. It has ‘realistic’,
‘stylised’ and ‘both’ written in them. The children pick one chit each from
the two bundles and follow what is written. They can try multiple times
with different combinations each time.

As we discuss the representation of stylised art forms, the
first thing that comes to one’s mind is the rich and beautiful
sculptures and carvings we see on the walls of ancient buildings,
including temples. Can you recall some of the artistic carvings
that you have seen recently?
Name of the building
Location
Name one unique thing you remember about the art works
This brings us to the next part of exploring emotions.

ANCIENT ARCHITECTURE
The uniqueness of Indian culture is that — though such heritage
sculptures are ancient, but they are still relevant and apply to
everyday life.
Indian architecture, with its breathtaking sculptures, serves
as a timeless gallery of human emotion, depicting the essence
of Navarasas in stone. Every part of the country has these
sculptures in different styles that also represent the dynasty
and its history. Each building, temple and sculpture has a
unique story to tell. The sculptures depicting emotions have
stories that have more emotions hidden within them. Here are
some of them.

A sculpture of a young boy — Saḷa, fighting
a lion. What emotion does it evoke?
Bravery and courage, Veera rasa.
This is from the Chennakeshava Temple,
Belur, Karnataka. The Hoysḷa dynasty
that ruled the place got the name from
this — Hoy-Saḷa, meaning, kill the
lion, Saḷa! (1006 – 1346 CE).

A sculpture of Dvarapalaka (guardian
of the entrance). The emotion it
evokes — fear. Does it not look scary?
This sculpture in Bhayanaka rasa is
meant to scare off the negative
forces.
You can see more such
sculptures at the Brihadeeshwara
temple, Tanjavur, Tamil Nadu. This
was built by the Chola Dynasty
(815 – 1280 CE).

DO YOU

cement or soil
were used
to keep the stones
of the temple together. It does
not even have the conventional
foundation under the ground, like
most modern buildings. Yet, not
only is this temple one of the tallest
of its kind, it has also stood strong
against earthquakes and storms for
over a 1000 years!

This is an interesting sculpture with three emotions
in one. This is the Trimurti in the Elephanta
Caves in Maharashtra. It has three faces of
Shiva, each depicting a different emotion and a
meaning — creation, sustenance and destruction.
This was built during the Rashtrakuta Dynasty
(755 – 975 CE).

ACTIVITY 1.3: FIND A PICTURE!

DEDICATION OF A LIFETIME!

Find a picture of a temple sculpture that you
have seen and paste it in the box below.

If you notice the time period, all these sculptures that
are artistically perfect have survived for hundreds
of years, while today’s buildings might not last a few
decades. What is the difference? The time and effort
put by every individual artist involved in making
these sculptures was wholehearted, as they believed
this was God’s work. Even a minor scratch or a glitch
was considered bad as nothing could go wrong in
God’s work. That was the level of dedication. It was
never considered as just a ‘job’ for which a salary was
paid, as it is the case today.

Write about the emotion in the sculpture and
the story behind it.

Here is an interesting story that tells us about the
level of dedication the artists had. It is believed to
be true.
Master craftsman Jakaṇachārī, was ordered by the
Hoysaḷa King, Nṛipa Haya to build a grand temple.
His dedication to work was such that he left home
and immersed himself in making sculptures. It is said
that he chose each stone after a blessing from God.
He had stayed away from home for so many years
that he didn’t know anything about his family. One
day, a young artist joined his team and immediately
spotted a major flaw in one of the stone statues. A

flaw by Jakaṇachārī was
unheard of as he was a
perfectionist. But a test was
conducted and a cavity was
found in the navel part of the
sculpture, where a frog was
living! This was a huge blow
on the great artist’s work. As
promised, he cut off his hands
as he considered himself
incapable of the God’s work
he was assigned. It was later
discovered that the young
boy was none other than the
artist’s son Daṅkaṇāchāri!
Hearing this, Jakaṇachārī
felt proud and thankful for
such a blessing of a dedicated
expert son. He later took over
to complete the temple work. It is also said that God blessed him to
regain his hands and the father-son duo completed the temple in
Belur, Karnataka. We still look up to these works in awe. Do you think
any of today’s buildings match the kind of detailing and artistic work
done in those days?
It was all possible only through the dedication, commitment and
persistence of thousands of artists.

KEY TAKEAWAYS — LESSONS FOR LIFE
Theatre and Life
Have you noticed how different people express emotions in different ways? While
some may smile when they are nervous, others may become silent when sad.
Theatre helps us understand these emotions and their ways of expression. This
in turn helps in building better emotional understanding of others or empathy.


As you play games like ‘Emotional Corners’ or ‘Hot Seat’ (in Grade 6), you learn
that there is no ‘correct’ way to feel or express yourself. As you observe others
in the game, you notice that different people not only express differently, but
also perceive and experience situations differently! Your ability to understand
and accept this will make you emotionally strong.



These activities in theatre also help you understand that all emotions are
equal. The stories you choose have situations of both humour and joy, as well
as anger or jealousy. This is true in real life also. As the ancient scriptures and
sculptures point out, it is important that we accept all emotions, and express
them freely, without inhibitions. Just as theatre activities do not expect you
to show only comic situations and leave out the unhappy ones, in life too, you
must be able to experience, share and express all emotions equally. But, as in
theatre, it is important not to over-do anything.

Theatre is not just about acting on stage. It is about feeling, growing and
connecting with people in better ways. This is called emotional intelligence. Just
like theatre, life is full of surprises. But with empathy, confidence and an open
heart, you are ready to face anything!

Speech — MIME

“Mime as an art form speaks the universal language of silence. It can
make the invisible become visible and make silence the most powerful
and loudest form of communication.”
— Marcel Marceau (a well-known French mime artist)
Imagine a situation where you are at an important
event and nobody is allowed to talk. You suddenly
remember that you had kept your umbrella
outside as you were waiting for your friend,
before the event began. But forgot to bring it inside
with you. You are in the middle of the hall and cannot
walk outside. You have to tell your friend sitting near
the entrance door to go out and bring it in for you. How
would you communicate it?
Sit in pairs in the class and communicate this to each
other. You can take turns doing this. If possible, you can
also continue the conversation, for example, the friend
replies by saying it is not possible to walk out. You request
again, saying it is important — and so on. But all in silence!
What did you just do? Communicate using actions
and expressions. Right? You just did a mime bit, that was

Here are some basic terms that you might be

Body Language

Technique-based terms
Mime: A form of acting that uses
no words or sound. Could be a part
of a bigger play with dialogues.
The person performing this is
also called a ‘mime’.
Pantomime: A
theatrical performance
that involves multiple
actors and music. The
show involves acting,
mostly in comedy.

Interactive: Incorporating
audience participation to make
them ‘a part of the illusion’ for
more impact.
So let us jump right in and try doing some
mime.

21 | SAY MORE WITHOUT SPEECH – MIME

22 | KRITI

ACTIVITY 2.1: INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITY
Since mime is all about
performing without using
a specific set or props, first
you have to learn how to
create an imaginary world
and convince the audience
of its existence. Think of
an object that you use
every day, say your pencil
box. Now pretend you are
holding it in your hand. You
have to remember the size
and shape of it as you ‘mime’
its presence in your hand.
Now, try and enact how
you would hold the pencil
box as if it is filled with iron
(same size and shape). Now,
imagine it is fully empty.
How would you show these
changes? Try different
options to experience an
object without touching it.

Now, before we actually begin mime work, here
are some basic tips to help you.
1. DO NOT become the object, Use the object
This is a common mistake made while showing an
object. You have to show how you hold the object and
not make your hand into the object. Here are some
examples —
Show a pair of
scissors

Correct

Wrong

Holding a gun

Correct

Wrong

2. Establish the space (size) and
weight of the object
To make imaginary objects more believable, a mime
has to ensure that the
actions are in line with
the quality of object they
are handling. A cricket
ball, a basketball, a
balloon — the size, weight
and the experience of
each one is very different
from the other.
Try doing actions of holding
each one separately. With this
in mind, let us play a fun game
to learn this better.

If you just pointed two fingers and moved them
like a pair of scissors moved, then it is a mistake. If
we can modify our fingers to create a gun, then how
would we show a larger object? Say, a train or a car
or a fridge? Hence, the first rule of mime is to use the
object.

23 | SAY MORE WITHOUT SPEECH – MIME

24 | KRITI

ACTIVITY 2.2: TEAM ACTIVITY (FULL CLASS)
All of you sit in a circle. One of you volunteers to start with an imaginary
object. The first person imagines an object, does an action to clearly
depict it in terms of its shape, size and weight. The object is then passed
on to the next one. Next person receives it, does another action to add to
the understanding of the object and passes it on.
Nobody can use sound or speech. Nobody must announce the name
of the object. It is upto the understanding of the students and each one’s
ability to communicate.
Basic — Everyday objects like pen, a pair of scissors or a watch can
be shown. When the object is received, each one of you does a unique
action that is n o t done before and then passes it on.
Advanced — This also has everyone
passing the object. But the object
changes slightly with time. So,
the action done by the first
person would not be the
same for the last person.
For example, a huge ice
cube (melts with time) or
a handful of sand (keeps
reducing in quantity as it
slips through the fingers).

THREE PILLARS OF
A MIME SHOW
Any successful mime show must
have the following three aspects.
Remember, all these have to be
practiced both individually and
as a group.

1.

Imagination

For a mime show, along with
working on your body language
and expressions, the most crucial
one is imagination. While the
first two are entirely about the
performer and their effort,
imagination
involves
both
performer and the audience.

Unless
the
audience
participates in the imagination
of the objects, situations and
the environment of the story,
it cannot be a successful show.
This ‘give and take’ between the
audience and actor — making the
show unique and enjoyable — is
facilitated by imagination!

is specifically important when
performances are held for a
large audience. This is similar
to the Natyadharmi style of
acting, from Chapter 1, which
includes dramatic and stylised
techniques like slow motion,
repetition, and over expression
to bring about this impact.

2. Exaggeration

3. Costume and Make up

This is the technique of making
movement,
actions
and
expressions larger than life.
Since mime relies on silent
communication,
it
becomes
important to ensure subtle details
are visible and understood. This

Unlike drama or dance, costume
and make up in mime do not
directly depict the character. It
is primarily neutral, with subtle
differences to show variation in
character.

25 | SAY MORE WITHOUT SPEECH – MIME

26 | KRITI

Costume — shirt and pant is fully
black
(if the backdrop is white) or a mix of black and white
in the form of stripes on shirt or accessories like
gloves, socks or suspenders.
Make up — highlighted facial features with
contrasting colours of white, black and red is the main
feature of make up. This is to ensure good visibility
and exaggeration of expressions.
Character — specific
present in make up.

indications

are

subtly

people who could be from any society, from any part
of the world. It can even break gender stereotypes,
for example, a scene with mining underground or
building construction could have women carrying
loads of weight, as the costume they wear is the same
in mime.
Mime is also used as a powerful tool to help people
come out of their trauma or get over bad experiences,
as it gives them the freedom to express and share
without the fear of being judged.

MIME — A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
FOR EQUALITY
The most striking quality of mime is — no speech.
This breaks all barriers of language across the world.
Emotions are universal. So the situations depicted in
mime from any state in the country or any country
in the world are understood by any person from any
corner of the world. Is it not amazing?
The next quality that stands out in mime is — black
and white costumes, and a common white make up
for all. This has a powerful quality of eliminating
the bias that comes with stereotypes of people based
on the clothes they wear. It is pure story telling by

A pantomime performance

ACTIVITY 2.3 : GROUP MIME
The class is divided into groups of 5 – 10. You will be given a
scene to enact. You can use all the properties and sets that are
necessary for the scene. Enact it like a regular play by your
group.
Now, your team has to mark the set placements in your
minds and remove the chairs, tables, etc. You now enact the
whole scene without any sets. The props (held in your hand
like walking stick, bow and arrow, etc.) can still be used. Once
you are familiar with the sets, the props are also removed.
Enact the whole scene without any sets or props.
Practise — perform your daily routine
from when you wake up in the morning
till you get to bed at night, in mime. Try
and remember the minor details and depict
it in your actions.
Music — you can have background
music to suit the situation of your act.
But make sure it is instrumental music
with no lyrics or speech.
Note to the Teacher: The scene they pick for enactment can be their own

STAGE TECHNICALS 2
i. BACKSTAGE WORK — THE
INVISIBLE PILLAR OF THEATRE
A tree in full bloom with flowers and fruits is such
a beautiful sight to watch!
But what is the source of its beauty? Its strong
and healthy roots.
A beautifully constructed ancient temple that
tells us many stories of the past, is a matter of
pride. What is its strength?
Its strong and deep underground foundation.
What do you understand from these examples?
Anything that is interesting, meaningful and
successful to the people, needs a strong support
system.

This is the work of backstage crew for any
performance. It is a team of people who take up
different responsibilities and work hard to ensure
the performance runs smoothly, without any glitches. While most
people think that theatre is mainly about acting on stage, it is a
lesser-known fact that those working backstage are equally, if not
more important.

You will learn
 Backstage and its importance.
 Life skills from
theatre — problem solving,
discipline and integrity.
 Script writing — character
work and scene division.

With so much importance being given to backstage
work, you must be wondering, what is backstage? Is it
the physical space that extends behind the performing
area? Why is it so important?

It is important not because of the physical space,
but because of the work that happens and the people
involved. Notice all the effort and hard work of the
backstage team as the actors perform on stage.

31 | Let’s Design — Stage Technicals 2

32 | KRITI

Backstage work involves the following aspects —

1.

Set and Properties



Changing the stage set
according to the scenes being
performed.
Keeping all the hand props
ready for the actors to
pick up.
Making sure the stage is
free of objects that may
obstruct the actors.
Support during the scene, in case something goes
wrong or something is forgotten by the actor.







2. Costume and Make up


Getting the actors ready with
character related costume
and make up.



Helping with quick
changes between scenes.



Support with minor
tear and damage in
costumes.

3. Music


Working with the actors and tech team to get
the right cues for sound tracks.



Working on music and
sound effects that suit the
performance.



Sometimes cover-up onstage
glitches with appropriate
sound or music.

4. Lighting


Plan lights and know your
cues well.



Timing lights and supporting
the actors during unexpected
issues.

If you noticed, all the above points are about
things done during the show. Though the major
backstage responsibility is during the show, there
is a lot of planning and preparation that happens
before and after the show. Planning after the show?

With the above understanding of the kind of work
that happens backstage, how many people do you
think are required for each department? And how
many people would be working backstage for a play
that may have about 8 – 10 actors? At least 15 – 18
people! (sometimes more).

With so many people and
teams working together for
one show, what would
be the most important
aspect to make sure all
of it functions well?

Planning, Management and Discipline
There are many life skills that can be acquired by doing theatre
and more specifically backstage work.
Team Work and Leadership
All departments to work in coordination
and mutual understanding with each other.
A problem with one could affect the whole
show.
Human resource

Communication
Constant sharing of ideas and issues between
teams is crucial for a show. If one team is
unaware of what the other team is facing,
coordination would be affected which would
in turn affect the performance.

Having the right kind of people to take
up different responsibilities is of prime
importance. Ensuring all are comfortable
in their work also helps in maintaining high
quality of work.

Resource Management

Time management

Sales and Marketing

This is a must for every member — be it actors
or backstage. It is spoken of in detail in the
section given in the next page.

With all the hard work being put in by the
teams, is it not important to have a good
audience to watch it?

Making sure the materials for making set,
props and costumes are procured on time,
ensuring they are stored safely and keeping a
check on finances and budget.

Discipline and commitment

V Rama Murthy was a backstage
professional well-known across
the country for his work in
lighting, sound, stage design,
mime and music. He not only
produced many plays and mime
shows, but also trained many
people/backstage crew, who are
successfully employed in theatre
till today!

This is a quality that every member has to develop to
be able to successfully perform as a team. Qualities
like —


Attending all rehearsals and preparation sessions
without giving excuses.



Doing your assignments and preparation as per
the director’s instructions.



Arriving on time and not making the team wait
for you.



Making sure you are present for all repeat shows
and their rehearsals.



Volunteering for additional help during free
time, sharing resources like costumes and props.

With all the elements of backstage discussed
above, do some of the points sound similar to what
your teachers and parents constantly tell you to
follow in school or at home? It is true that most of
these qualities are applicable in your daily life too.
But the only difference is, theatre lets you have fun as
you learn these skills.

Tapas Sen was an expert
lighting designer between
1940 and 2006. He was like
a magician with lights, in
an era when sophisticated
equipment was not available.
Apart from the numerous
plays he designed lights for
in India, he was invited to
design lights for new year celebrations of the year
2000 at the Eiffel tower, Paris. He designed lights for
numerous shows across the world.

Let us make a list of things that you think you
can use outside of theatre also. First two have been
given as examples —

Theatre skills in my life

uniform and stationary.
2. Practise (study) regularly so you are confident
during performance (exams). Saving everything
for the last minute will not help.

You are free to add to this list in your notebook.

History of Backstage
Backstage work for plays is as ancient as theatre,
this is because, any performance at any point in
history, needs a strong support system working
behind it. Infact, the oldest treatise on performing
arts — the Natyashastra, written more than 2500
years ago, has an extremely detailed description
and step-by-step set of instructions of all that
has to be followed in a preparation for the show.
History of backstage is called Poorvaranga Vidhi, it
elaborates on everything from setting up the musical

instruments, sets and properties to invoking the
blessings of Gods to have an uninterrupted show.

Three bells in theatre
Any professional theatre performance has three
bells at different intervals. Each one has a different
meaning. This is not just for the cast and crew, but
for the audience as well! Here is what they mean:
First Bell — An indication for the audience
to maintain silence, as the play would start
soon. By this time, the sets and props related
to the first scene are placed on stage.
Second Bell — Now, the actors are on
stage and in position. Everyone back stage
also gets in position. This is an indication
that the stage mics have been switched
on. The announcement is made (name of the play,
playwright, director and special mentions). A strict
ban on flash photography and usage of phones
during the play are also announced.
Third Bell — The show begins!
The show is like the final exam for the
team, after so many rehearsals.
Can you identify the three steps that you would
follow, to make sure you avoid stress before exams
and do well?

There are also detailed descriptions of the structure
of Natya Gruha — the place where performances were
held and Nepathya the backstage or the entire space
around the stage except the audience. The discipline
and procedures followed here are called Nepathya
Vidhi. It had Mahavarinis (big elephant-shaped pillars)
at the corners of the stage where artists would keep the
sets and properties ready for entry and exits. Today
we have the concept of side wings that do a similar
job. Usually theatres have three wings creating three
pathways for entry and exit on both sides of the stage.
The importance of backstage work is summarised
in the below stanza from the Naṭyashastra — Chapter
5 Poorvaranga.

The Greek Theatre too had such arrangements,
specially since the performance space was open-air.
The place where the actors got ready with
costumes and masks were behind the performing
area, covered by green vineyards, trees and bushes.
This is why it was called the Green Room. This is used
by performers across the world to this day! The place
where make up and costume changes
are done are still called Green
Rooms, though there is nothing
green about it anymore.

KNOW?

38 | KRITI

Here are some scenarios that can happen
anytime in a theatre performance. Put
yourself in the situation and write down
the solution. You can also come up with
more than one solution.
But keep in mind the time required for planning
and the actual time available. What is also important
is the money involved. For instance, you may not
be able to buy an entire new set, as it could get very
expensive.

Scenario 1
It is 11 in the morning and the show is scheduled
for the same evening. The team has just arrived at
the venue for a quick rehearsal. After that they start
getting ready for the show. During the rehearsal the
main actor falls down accidentally and injures his
leg. The injury, as the doctor says, is quite serious and
the actor will not be able to walk easily.
You also notice that the costume worn
by the actor is also torn. It is not possible
to get a different costume as that specific
colour and style was made-to-order.
It has an important reference in the
play. The same costume has also been
included in the posters for publicity.

The show begins in 5 hours.
What will you do?

Scenario 2
You are preparing for a show
based on a magical bracelet.
The entire story revolves
around it. It is a specially
made bracelet not available
in shops. It is show day.
Everyone is prepared and
excited, when the props in
charge comes running
to say the bracelet
has been stolen!
What will you do
then?
Make something that looks
like the stolen bracelet (the
original took 5 days to make),
change the script or manage
with lighting and dialogue
to suit the situation? Look
for the thief ? Find a solution
individually or discuss as a
team.

II. SCRIPT WRITING
‘WRITE RIGHT’

1.

“Without the script, a play is like a ship without
compass. A script anchors the story to the
vision.”
With such a major role, it is of utmost
importance to understand the details to make
sure you have the right script to work on your
play.
You have so far learnt the following —


Difference between a story and a script.



Three parts of a story:
Beginning — Middle — End.



Importance of conflict.



Writing simple conversations.

Structure

Structure, is simply the order in which you arrange story
events. The basic structure that you will have to follow is to
ensure you have the following elements —
Protagonist — Who the story is about.
Goal — What does he/she want?
Conflict — Obstacle in his/her path to the goal.
Resolution — Does he/she achieve goal? How?
For example, let us look at the Ramayana which we all are
familiar with. Identifying
the structure, we have:
Protagonist — Rama
Goal — Take care of
Ayodhya as the king,
follow the path of Dharma.

It is not enough to just learn these concepts.
You have to constantly practise them. You may
not have to write scripts all the time. You can
also identify them in the story books you read
or in the movies you watch. It will give you a
good understanding of how it is implemented.
We now move on to the next steps of
writing a script.

Conflict — Banished to
the forest for 14 years, his
wife Sita is kidnapped by
Ravana.
Resolution — Finds
support of Hanuman to
bring back Sita, completes
14 years, returns to rule
Ayodhya.

39 | Let’s Design — Stage Technicals 2

40 | KRITI

Now, with these main pointers in place, it is easy for you to
connect them to form a well-structured story.
You can put this structure to any story. Let us try with stories from
your Social Science textbook.
Story

Protagonist Goal

Conflict

Resolution

Example: Harsha wants
to solve the mystery of the
sound coming from the
backyard of his house. His
problem is that he is afraid
of darkness.

Maurya and
Kautilya

ACTIVITY 3.2.1

b. Prabhavati

List out the main characters with
these details —

Excellent! This a great way to understand and remember stories.
You can work on more stories like Vikramaditya and Prithviraj
Chauhan in your book.

 Name, age, background
information.

2. Characters
A script has many characters that support in communicating the
story. But when you are writing, you have full control over how
many characters you want and what each character does in the
story. You, as a writer, have the right to introduce any character
and remove any character when you choose to. But, any right comes
with responsibility! So, write responsibly.
Know your main characters well
What do they want in the story? What issues or problems do they have
as an individual? (Not to be confused with the conflict of the story.)

 Individual problem and special
features, if any.
Understand the changes in
characters through the story
Every experience and situation we face
brings about a change in us. It could
build strength in us or give us a new
perspective about a person or change
our opinion about something. Just like
it happens to us, it can happen to the
characters too.

Example: Harsha tries to solve
the mystery but keeps failing as he
avoids going out after dark. One day
his Ajji visits and tells him about how
she was scared of getting into a bus,
but worked on herself to get over it.
This inspires Harsha to get over his
fear of darkness. So, the story from
this point onwards will have Harsha
reacting differently when he goes to
the backyard after it is dark. This is
known as the character arc.

Supporting characters

ACTIVITY 3.2.2

ACTIVITY 3.2.3

 Make a note of characters
in terms of thought and
behaviour.

List all supporting actors in your script and check if this
character is —

 How are they when the story
begins?
 How are they mid-story?

Though the story is not about them, these
characters are equally important. The
main characters will not be able to do
much without these characters. So feel free
to add new characters who help the story.
But remember to be responsible! Every
new character has to have a meaning and
purpose towards the goal of the script.
Example: Ajji, who helps Harsha overcome his fear is a good
supporting character. A scientist who gives information about sound
and wind is a good supporting character. But, a milkman who comes
home everyday, without contributing to the actual mystery, need not
be in the script at all.

 Making a difference to the main character or the goal?
 Providing context to a situation.
If they do not, consider removing them.

 How are they at the end of the
story?

41 | Let’s Design — Stage Technicals 2

42 | KRITI

3. Scenes
You must have seen a book divided into chapters. Likewise, parts of
a play/movie are divided into scenes. Why is this required? Why can
everything not go on continuously?

CIRCLE
TIME

Scenes are divisions that mark a change in time,
place or action

Script Writing

You have the right to choose how many scenes you want to have. But
remember? With rights, come responsibilities! Check for these points
for every scene you have. If it does not satisfy them, you will have to
rework on the division of scenes.

1.

Which character in a play
or movie you saw, is your
favourite? Identify its
character arc and flaw.

Purpose of a scene

2.

Since you have to start
writing your script, what
genre and topic would it be
about?

3.

Is there a movie or play
where you thought the script
was not good at all? Why?

Does it take the story forward or introduce a new character or bring
clarity to a situation?
Valid scene transitions
Scene change should not be abrupt, it must follow the thought flow of
the audience.
Each scene should logically connect to the previous and next scene.
Beginning — Middle —End for each scene
An introduction, achieving the core purpose and concluding with a
lead to the next scene.
First scene and Last scene
Grab the audience’s attention in the first scene to maintain interest
throughout. End with impact, tying up all loose ends without leaving
unanswered questions.

Write your own Script!
Yes, by putting together all that you have learnt
till now, you are definitely capable of writing
your own script. Here is a quick step-by-step
checklist to support you in this process —


On my own
I will write the script
In a group (get your team ready with 3 – 4
friends).



Choose a concept or idea that inspires you
(if it doesn’t interest you, it can’t interest
your readers).
Or



Choose one of the pictures on the right.
Observe it and build a story.



Prepare
an
overall
Beginning — Middle — End structure with
the conflict clearly defined.



Put
it
into
the
structure
of
protagonist — goal — obstacle — resolution.



Create characters, divide into scenes and
write dialogue.

You now have the ‘Draft 1’ of your first
script! You can make improvements till it is
ready. Now start rehearsing!

KEY TAKEAWAYS — LESSONS FOR LIFE
Backstage — Making magic happen
Theatre is not just about the actors in costumes performing on stage.
It is a collective effort. For every successful performance by an actor,
there are multiple people working backstage, to make it happen. This
builds a spirit of mutual respect and value for work. Backstage work
always happens in silence. All the work happens when the play is going
on. So, from coordinating to troubleshooting, it is all done in silence
(you can probably use your mime skills here!). What is also silent is
the congratulatory messages. While most of the applause is taken by
the actors, the backstage crew accept the applause and congratulations
silently!
The most beautiful feeling of doing backstage work is the feeling of
‘making the magic happen’. After a successful show, you know that your
time and effort has been majorly instrumental in that success.

4 Storytelling traditions
Once
upon
a
time, there was a
girl — Kathanjali, who
loved telling stories.
She knew all the stories from
ancient history to the most modern
ones. She also created stories. She has
been living for thousands of years.
She has seen many kings and rulers,
lived among the common people, and
also travelled across the world. So, she
remembers the stories she has read
and lived through many of the stories!
But she is always curious and in search
of more interesting stories.
Let us listen to her —
You will learn
 Folk forms of storytelling in India.
 Problem faced by the artists today.
 Well-known traditional storytellers.

Namaste! Though I have travelled across the world, my favourite
place has always been Bharata. No matter where I am, I prefer to
come back here as it feels like home! It has the most beautiful stories.
Do you know how it all started? Many, many years ago, when I was
going to different places in Bharata, I realised that the people did not
know stories at all. They were missing the fun and the values they
could learn. I had to find a way to tell them stories. Since I could not
do it all by myself, I created storytellers.

They were people who could remember and
narrate stories in very interesting ways. This was
fun. There were so many storytellers across the
country telling different stories to everyone from
small children to old people.
This went on for hundreds of years. Around
the 2nd century BCE, I noticed that the listeners
sometimes got bored or were distracted. So I had
to find something new to make it interesting.
That is when I introduced pictures, music, dance
and puppets. Wow! This made storytelling a very
different experience for people of all ages. I went to
different parts of the country and created different
ways of using pictures, music and dance to tell
stories, based on their traditions. Do you want to
know about some of them?

47 | STORY OF INDIA’S STORYTELLING TRADITION

48 | KRITI

HARIKATHE
During the 12th century, I was travelling in the
southern part of Bharata. I visited a lot of beautiful
temples and met kings who encouraged art and
culture. But, I realised that a lot of people were still
unaware of the wonderful stories we have.
I remembered Narada Muni who went
from one place to another, narrating
stories of Lord Vishnu. This would
be a great way to tell stories here,
I thought. So I encouraged
the Bhagavatar community
to start telling stories
through songs and dance. The
people loved it as it was also
interactive.
Because
they
narrated the stories of Lord
Hari, it came to be known as
Harikathe.
It became popular across
Andhra Pradesh, Telangana,
Maharashtra, Karnataka and
Tamil Nadu. The storyteller
was called Harikathe
Dasa.

Harikathe — Gururajulu Naidu
This multilingual,
multitalented storyteller,
Gururajulu Naidu, was
born in 1931.
His contributions to
Harikathe gave him the
title Karnataka Harikathe
Pitamaha.
While
actual
Harikathe performances
were going on all night long, his style
revolutionised Harikathe performance, with a
duration of 90 minutes, which was welcomed
by the audience.
His famous Harikathe performances
include Bhakta Markendeya, Bhakta Siriyala,
Mahi Ravana, Maya Bazaar, Nallathanga Devi,
Gaja Gowri Vrata, Shri Krishna Garudi, Lava
Kusha, and many more.
He has also been an actor in movies like
Mooruvare Vajragalu, Hannele Chiguridaaga,
Madhu Malathi, and many more.

KAAVAD KATHA
This is a storytelling tradition that is over 500 years old.
When I realised that the common people were unable to
read scriptures like the Ramayana, Mahabharata, Puranas
and other stories from our tradition, I asked the Bhaats, a
craftspeople community in Rajasthan to create an interesting
way of using pictures to tell stories. As pictures do not need
language, anyone could understand them. So they travelled
from village to village with the Kaavad, telling stories to
people in their language. They also included
songs in it.
They also told stories from the
Panchatantra and Hitopadesha for
children. These days, they also tell
modern stories that give valuable
messages that are socially relevant,
like educating girl children in
villages and maintaining hygiene.
This box of pictures is created
with the wood of mango tree.
According to the requirement of
the story, the boxes have anywhere
between 8 to 16 parts. the biggest
cover made so far is 25 feet long!
There have been many storytellers
in these forms who travelled across

Kaavadiya — KhojaRam ji
Khojaram ji is
from Kumar Dhani
near Jodhpur,
Rajasthan. He has
been practicing
Kaavad Katha for
more than 40 years
now. He is among
few surviving
Kaavadiyas.
He says, earlier
people believed in gyan-daan-bhagwan.
Everyone would gather under a tree
to listen to Kaavad Katha. Kaavad, as
the temple would come to them and
they would not just look at the God but
listen to the knowledge embedded in
the stories of Gods. Now, we go to the
jajman’s house once a year. He, like other
Kaavadiyas also maintains a book which
also keeps the records of people living,
dead and newly born, in the families of
the neighbourhood.

Stories from Buddhist
scriptures, events in the
lives of saints and local
folk stories.

Though these were
very popular, now they
are
slowly
becoming
rare. Young people are
not learning this to take it
forward. With everyone
watching television and
smartphones, there is
no one to listen to their
stories. If the storytellers
are gone, the stories also
go away with them. Don’t

keep these traditions alive
and spread them across
the world?

51 | STORY OF INDIA’S STORYTELLING TRADITION

KEY TAKEAWAYS — LESSONS FOR LIFE
Storytelling — A Treasure in Tradition
You might be wondering why we have to save these storytelling forms.
These are oral traditions. Stories have been passed down through
generations. Everyone in our country knows about the Ramayana and
Mahabharata today because of these oral traditions. Even if a person
cannot read or write, these stories can teach them values for life. The
most important factor is that they keep our culture and traditions alive.
While written books or computer data can be destroyed in seconds, these
stories in oral tradition can never be destroyed. So, go ahead and learn a
storytelling style and carry the tradition forward!

NOTE TO THE TEACHERS
The world of music is all about sur, laya and
shabd. These elements are woven to express lyrical
compositions which express myriad emotions of
love, devotion, patriotism, chivalry, appreciation of
nature, grief, etc. Music is boundless and is popular
among the people of all ages. A crowded and noisy
assembly of children in a school suddenly echoes
with melody and harmony of musical expression in a
peaceful manner. The music curriculum aspires that
you and the students thoroughly enjoy the journey
of music which has the capacity to unfold immense
possibilities. The teachers should aim to instil a lifelong
love for music among the learners, fostering a deep
appreciation that will grow beyond the classroom.
Also, the syllabus of Grade 7 aims to enable students
to gain deeper insights to unfold multiple aspects
connected to this popular and ever engaging art form.
This section unfolds to let the learners know the
different stages of making music. Music has layers,
which comprise varied forms of expression through
moderation in voices, pitch, tempo, parts of musical
instruments, orchestration, and many other elements.
A critical review of the songs will help the learners
comprehend the varied factors that contribute to
creating a composition.

5_Music.indd 58

All compositions sung on different occasions are
significant. Music can be a resource to propagate
many types of messages in a society including —
importance of varied occupations and skills, social
reforms, health-related issues, etc. It is related to
dance and movement, playback music in theatre,
film-making, etc. The ‘music’ section will help the
learners unravel such aspects.
Examples of some basic skills of practising
sargams, traditional folk and classical forms of music
have been given. While the teachers should stick to
the curriculum and basic guidelines, they have the
liberty to introduce the topics in their own way. Also,
let the students research and find out more from the
sources available to them.
There are many opportunities to experience
different genres of music in everyday life.
Enthusiastic participation will help them love the
art form genuinely and discover the diversity in the
Indian context. This book aims to motivate students
to appreciate music.

Consider taking students
performances for exposure.

There are guidelines for Formative Assessments
at the end of each chapter, which should be
conducted in a relaxed and engaged manner, and
mainly through observation in the classroom.
The suggestions for Summative Assessments are
provided at the end of the music section. The

competencies required to be fulfilled at this stage
are given below. The aim of assessments is mainly
to see whether children are able to reach the
competencies laid out, or whether more support is
needed. Give children qualitative feedback to help
them develop further.

ACTIVITY 5.2: MEASURE YOUR ACCURACY
 Sing a song that you are comfortable singing.

Harmony and Canon

 You can use a karaoke track if you have one.

When you hear multiple voices of people singing
together, creating a pleasing blend of different
notes, it is called singing in harmony. Harmony is
common in many styles of music, both instrumental
and vocal.

 Record yourself singing and listen
back — see where you are in pitch
and rhythm, and where you
are not.
 Compare your version to
the original audio and note
the areas of improvement.
 Identify someone else
(like a classmate, friend,
teacher or family member) listen and give you
a constructive feedback.
Use this information to improve your performance.
Note to the Teacher: This activity can be done
as an individual or group activity. Students
can record their voices and either assess it
themselves or ask for peer assessment.

5_Music.indd 62

MAKING MUSIC TOGETHER

There is an easy way to start singing in harmony,
and that is, by singing a canon. A canon is where
different groups of singers sing the same melody
but start at different times. Songs that are written
as canons, are written so that the different notes
you hear at the same time, sound good together.
You can select any patriotic song, folk song, for
example —


Kuṭṭanaḍan punjayile kochu peṇṇe kuyilale
(you learnt in Grade 6)



Hum honge kaamyaab (you learnt in Grade 3)

First, sing the song together. Remember to keep
time, so you are all singing together. Then divide
the class into two groups.

01-May-25 1:51:32 PM

Group 1: Hum Honge
Kamyaab (2)

MUSIC AS TEAMWORK

Group 2: Hum Honge
Kamyaab (2)

This era was a time imbued with deep spiritual and
musical traditions. As the first rays of dawn painted the
horizon, a team of Vedic priests — Ritvijs, guardians
of the sacred hymns, from the four Vedas, assembled
in the morning with the institutor, Yajamāna and his
wife — Yajamāna-patnī, in the Yāga-śhālā, to begin
the sacred Vedic fire ceremony — the Śhrauta-Yajña.

Group 1 sings the first line, and continues to the
second line.
When Group 1 starts the third line, Group 2 starts
singing the first line. Repeat the song a few times, so
that you can hear all the harmonies.
If this feels easy, try making four groups! Group 1
starts with the first line, and when they sing the second
line, Group 2 starts with the first line and so on.
How does it sound when everyone is singing together?

Amongst this team of ritvijs, there is a unique
sub-team of four ritvijs specialised in the Sāma-Vēda.
They are led by the main Sāma-Vēdī-Ritvij — the
Udgātā, and together they are known as the UdgātṛiGaṇa. Alongside the Sāma-Vēda, they are highly
skilled in devotional music, both singing and playing
traditional musical instruments. They harmonize
verses from Sāma-Vēda Saṁhitā, the divine texts that
form the cornerstone of Vedic ceremonies. In the
Yāga-śhālā, facing East (the direction of the rising
sun) — an eternal symbol of divinity and renewal —
the Sāma-Vēdī-Ritvijs divided themselves into distinct
roles. Each role contributes to the intricate structure
and harmonious nature of Sāma-Vēda chanting
known as Sāma-gāna. The singing of the Sāma-gāna
composition is generally divided into five sections
called bhaktis.

the Yajamāna-patnī plays an important role by playing the
Śhatatantrī Vīṇā, during the Sāma-gāna and also singing
important sections of the Sāma-gāna.

1.  Prastāva: The introduction of the
composition is initiated by the Prastotā.
2.  Udgītha: The primary section, which forms
the core of the Sāma-gāna recitations, and
is sung by the head Ritvij Udgātā.

5_Music.indd 64

This morning ritual was far more than a musical exercise;
it was a spiritual offering, a harmonious bridge between
humanity and divinity. The symphony of voices and the
disciplined roles of the ritvijs exemplified the Vedic pursuit
of unity in diversity, reflecting the profound connection
between sound, spirituality, and nature.

ACTIVITY 5.3: CHANT SHLOKAS IN A GROUP

3.  Pratihāra: It is sung by continuing from the
last line of the Udgītha, by the Pratihartā.

ॐ असतोो माा सद्गमय । तमसोो माा ज्योोति र्गगमय ।
मृृत्योोर्माा  अमृृतंं गमय । ॐ शाान्तिः ः शाान्तिः ः शाान्तिः ः ॥

4.	 Upadrava: The connective musical
interlude, i.e., the instruments and the
rhythmic interpretations, which is again
rendered by the Udgātā.

om shantihi shantihi shantihi

5.  Nidhana: The concluding section, it is sung
in unison by all ritvijs, creating a profound
and unified culmination.

Lead me from false to the truth, darkness to
light, from death to immortality.

In addition, the fourth Sāma-VēdīRitvij — Subrahmaṇya — has the specific duty
of chanting the Subrahmaṇyāhvāna. Alongside,

MUSIC, EMOTIONS
AND CREATIVITY

Music expresses various
emotions (rasas). When
you sing or play music,
you are communicating
a feeling or an emotion.
In the Indian performing
arts, emotions are referred to as rasas. This
emotion is simultaneously experienced by the
artists and audience. It is this emotion that
connects the artists with the audience. So, always
remember to sing with passion and expression.
Let us continue this journey of learning various
forms of music and the rasas they express.
The Abhinaya Darpana written by Nandikeshvara
says, ‘sabha kalpataru bhaati’ which means, the
audience is like a tree which fulfills your inner
wishes. Though this has been written in the
context of dance, it applies to all art forms.

DEVOTIONAL MUSIC
People pray in different ways. Music allows people
to express the feeling of devotion. People often come
together in groups and sing devotional songs, in different
styles of singing, using a variety of words, tunes and
rhythms. Let us understand how the words, tune and
rhythm come together when we sing a devotional song.
Here are some examples.
Shabad — Shabads are musical prayers in the Sikh
religion and are sung in the Gurudwara. Let us learn
this song.
koi boley raam raam koi khudaye
koi sevai gosayya koi alaahey
kaaran karan karan kareem,
kirapaa dhaar raheem ||1||
koi naaveye teerthh koi haj jaye ||
koi karey poojaa koi sir navaaey ||2||

MEANING
We pray with different names, such as Rama,
Guru, Allah and others, the aim is to thank the
almighty for giving us such a beautiful world.

Zindagi shamma ki surat ho, khuda ya meri
Lab pe pati pai dua ban ke tamanna meri

Jis tarah phool se hoti hai chaman ki zeenat
Zindagi ho meri parwaane ki surat ya rab
Ilm ki shamma se ho mujh ko muhabbat ya rab
Ho mera kaam gareebon ki himaayat karna
Dardmandon se, zayifon se muhabbat karna

ACTIVITY 6.1

MEANING

For the devotional song that you have learnt, think about—

I carry a wish in my heart with words on my lips
to enable life to shine brightly for everyone, like
a guiding light. May my work have the power
to uplift the lives of the less fortunate, just
as flowers bring beauty to nature. My duties
should be able to enhance the lives of others.
Let life be marked by care and compassion, and
let my purpose be to offer a beacon of hope to
my companions.

 What is the emotion in the song that you have sung?
 What is the language in which it is sung?
 Make a note of the important words in the song and
understand their meaning. This is a great way to
increase your vocabulary in a language.
Note to the Teacher: Students can learn one or both
songs, or choose devotional songs from their own
culture or faith.

ACTIVITY 6.2: UNDERSTANDING A PAINTING THROUGH MUSIC
Look at the picture on your left —
 Observe it carefully. Based on the style of this painting, can you
identify the state or region it is from?
 Create two lines which will describe the plates one by one. It can
be in your native language. The lines should be rhythmic and
easy to sing. For example, “Dekho dekho sakhi dwar pe suj sanwar
kay kaun khada”.
 Sing it in groups and observe the next plate.
 Continue creating lines according to visual images and sing the
whole composition.
 You can work in groups.
 As you create and sing lines in a particular tune and rhythm, you
will find the exercise interesting. Document and record the entire
process and you will be able to understand how words and music
work together to evoke emotions.

Note to the Teacher: “Art integration is a cross-curricular
pedagogical approach that utilises various aspects and forms of
art and culture as the basis for learning concepts across subjects.
As a part of the thrust on experiential learning, art-integrated
education will be embedded in classroom transactions not only for
creating joyful classrooms but also for imbibing the Indian ethos
through integration of Indian art and culture in the teaching and
learning process at every level. This art-integrated approach will
strengthen the linkages between education and culture.”
[NEP 2020, 4.7]
Plan this session as per the above directive. Let it be a
collaboration with the History lesson, so that the
students imbibe the artistic traditions prevalent in the
country and link it with other curricular areas.

ACTIVITY 6.4: ACTIVE LISTENING

ACTIVITY 6.5: ACT IT OUT

‘Active listening’ is a term used when you listen
to something carefully and try to understand
it. Active listening is very important in music.
The more you listen to a wide range of music,
the more you start to pick up on different styles,
structures, and techniques that you might not
notice at first. It opens up your ear to different
genres, rhythms, or even nuances in production
that you would not have recognised otherwise.

 Listen to an instrumental musical piece or
background music from a film.

 Actively listen to a folk, tribal, modern or
contemporary song of your choice, or from a
list provided by your teacher.

 Take turns to analyse and interpret the piece of
music.
 What are the emotions that you can recognise?
 Try to enact the expressions in different
compositions.
 Feel free to use elements that you have learned
in Theatre and Dance to communicate the
emotions and story of the music.

 Explore how the lyrics and the tune tell a
story.
 What are the moods and emotions of the
lyrics and the tune?
 Now try the same
activity with a piece of
instrumental music.
 What are the
differences you notice
in the mood and
emotions?

The
notes
of
Indian
Classical Music evolved
from the ritual chanting of
the Samaveda. Initially, the Vedas
were chanted with three notes, namely,
Udatta (normal or medium tone), Anudatta
(not raised, or lower note) and Svarita (raised
pitch or higher). These gradually evolved into
the seven notes (sapta swara) that we use in
music.

Carnatic vocalist Aruna Sairam at a concert

As you can see, all these alankaras are built on
patterns. Can you try making your own patterns of
sargams or notes as vocal exercises?
Now let us sing a swarajati.
Before singing this composition, sing the Arohana
and the Avarohana. Try keeping tala as you sing the
composition. Adi Tala is a rhythm cycle of 8 beats.

A swarajati is a very old musical form in Carnatic
Music comprising swaras and
sometimes lyrics. Usually, it has
three parts — pallavi (refrain or
DO YOU
chorus), anupallavi (small section
KNOW?
after the pallavi) and one or
more charanams (verses).

Samay Chakra (time theory of
Hindustani ragas)
Classical Music is a dharohar, a treasure
passed from one generation to another.
Ragas in music express emotions and create
moods. In Hindustani music, different
ragas are sung at
different times of
the day. A pattern
of notes sounds
effective if you sing
it at a particular
time of the day.
For example, Raga
Bhairav is a morning
raga, while Raga
Yaman is generally
sung in the evening.

USTAD ZAKIR HUSSAIN (1951–2024)
Zakir Hussain was a renowned tabla maestro of India.
He was the son of Ustad Alla Rakha, a well-known
Tabla player. Zakir Hussain started playing the tabla
at a very young age. His study with his father was
intensive, “You grow up in a musical atmosphere”,
he said, “and you don’t have to do anything else”. He
began playing at concerts around the age of seven
and started touring at the age of twelve.

He played across a wide range of formats, from
accompanying legendary Hindustani musicians like
Pandit Ravi Shankar to solo tabla concerts. He was a
founding member of the pathbreaking world music
band, Shakti. He toured with the band for several
decades. He collaborated with a range of musicians
from around the world and performed in some of
the most prestigious venues of music. He received
countless awards, including the Padma Vibhushan
and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award from the
Government of India, and three Grammy awards.

FOLK SONGS AND COMMUNITY
Let us listen to this song given below. It
is an Assamese song and its form is Bihu.
What is a form? We have discussed this
in the previous classes. A form in music
refers to the style of singing or playing
musical instruments.

O …Bohagare akakhote naase
Korekoye bijuri ulahere
Meghore aare aare
O ...Daore jen dhol bojaye taale taale
Botajoke bihure geet gaare
ohol paare paare
Hurr runjhun moina gun gun moina guri
guri jaa naasana

Sing the song but first of all, try to read
all the words properly. Clap while singing,
this will help you understand the rhythm
of the song. You can all stand and dance in
Bihu style.

Song: Bihu bihu lagise gaat
Assamese song by Bhupen Hazarika
Bihu bihu lagise gaat bihu maro ahana
Uru uru korise mon epak naso ahana
Sinu sinu lage tomar naam ki tomar kuana
Bihu maro ahana epak naso ahana

O …nasani ye naasi jaa
Bihu geet epaki gaa bihu epaki gaa
Chiyuri mahare pepaki gateelo
Ahotor talate roy ukhal makhal lohalo
Nasaniye naasi jaay bihu geet epaki gaay

SONG SUMMARY
This Bihu geet, captures the spirit of Bohag
Bihu, a popular festival. The lyrics express
joy, celebration, and a deep connection to
nature, rhythm and tradition.
You can find more information about Bihu
and the associated festivities in your Grade 6
Hindi textbook — Malhar.

ACTIVITY 8.1
Just like the Assamese folk song you previously
learnt, there are different folk songs sung by people
of different regions. Do you know any folk song of
your region?
 Learn a folk song or a song of celebration from
your region.
 Think about the background of the song and
the purpose it serves in the community.
 What are the musical instruments used in the
regional song? Identify them with their names
and sound.
 Sing this song in the class and present the same
in the school assembly.
 Also make a presentation about the special
elements in the song, the people or the
community that sing it.
 Record the song through a mobile phone and
share it with your friends.
 Listen to a similar song from a different region
of India.
 Use appropriate movements along with the
song.

Note to the Teacher: Share such projects with other
schools in your cluster. Also during bagless days,
have both, discussion and presentation by
the students. Encourage the students to listen
to other songs composed by Sri Bhupen
Hazarika, who has been awarded the
Bharat Ratna for his music.

UNIQUE VOICES




ACTIVITY 8.2: UNCONVENTIONAL SINGERS

Listen carefully to the voices of your friends in the
classroom. Are they all unique, or do some sound
similar? Probably not! You will hear a variety
of tones — sharp
and clear, rich and
deep, and soft and
gentle. Just like our
appearances, each
voice is unique and
distinct. No two
people look exactly
alike and similarly,
no
two
voices
sound exactly the
same.
Have you ever wondered about the difference
between a male and a female voice? We often
assume that male voices are low-pitched and
female voices are high-pitched. However, this
is not always true. You will get a fair idea of
different types of voices when you listen to the
voices of your classmates.

Here are some examples of male and female
voices that are unconventional or unusual. Many
renowned artists have unconventional voices,
and this is what makes them unique and special.
Listen to their music online.

 Learn a lullaby from the members of your family.

Now let us sing another type
of song — A lullaby or a lori.

 Ask your parents or grandparents whether you had a favourite one
when you were a baby.

A lullaby is a song sung to
help a child fall asleep. While
a lullaby is usually sung by a
mother, can you think of other
people in the family who can
sing a lullaby for a baby?

 Make a note of the words and the specific tune of the lullaby.
 There is a lyrical lullaby, which was sung by a famous singer Geeta Dutt
for films. The song was Nanhee kali soney chali hawa dheerey aana,
Neend bharey pankh liye jhoolaa jhoola jaana. Listen to this song online.

ACTIVITY 8.4


Let us listen to a qawwali. A qawwali is a form of devotional
music that is related to the Sufi Islamic tradition. Traditionally,
qawwalis have been performed by a group of male musicians,
however today, many female musicians perform
qawwali, showing how musical forms can evolve
and adapt over time.



Some famous female qawwali singers include
Roshanara Begum, who was born in Kolkata.



Find and listen to a performance by a female
qawwali group online.



Learn a qawwali. So learn from a recording or
from an artist, who is in your vicinity.

WOMEN IN MUSIC

SONG SUMMARY

Several Indian women have left an indelible mark on
music through their poetry and compositions.

The song expresses Mira’s devotion to her lord,
Shree Krishna. She expresses that she has found the
most precious thing, her guru or teacher who has
been very kind to her. She says though she might
have lost worldly possessions, this devotion has
given her assets worth many births. Then she says
her lord is Krishna and she would sing his praises
happily.

MIRABAI
Mirabai was a poet and devotee of Shree Krishna who
lived in the 15th century CE. She was born a princess
in a royal family of Rajasthan and married prince
Bhojraj of Mewar. From a young age, she was devoted
to Lord Krishna, and later on, travelled to many places
associated with Krishna like Dwarka and Vrindavan.
She was a celebrated poet, and composed hundreds of
bhajans (devotional songs) in praise of Krishna. She
is remembered today as a great saint of the Bhakti
movement, and her bhajans are still sung in both
classical and devotional music styles. Let
us learn a popular Mira Bhajan.

ACTIVITY 8.5
Let us get to know Lal Ded.
Lalleshwari, commonly known as Lal Ded, was a
Kashmiri mystic and poet. She created many vakhs

MUSIC AND SOCIAL REFORM
Music can be used to express a point of view and the
urge for change in society. Many music composers and
poets have used songs to protest against the existing
social conditions and to advocate for messages of
equality and togetherness.

ANNAMACHARYA
Annamacharya
was
a
Telugu
musician,
composer
and
saint
who lived in the 15th century.
He is said to have composed 32,000
sankirtanas (devotional songs) in
praise of Lord Venkateshwara of
Tirupati. He was among the
earliest
to oppose
social
stigma
against untouchables.
His
songs
preach
messages of brotherhood
and morality.
One of his well-known
compositions is Brahmam
Okate.

SONG: BRAHMAM OKATE
Tandanana ahi tandanana pure
Tandanana ahi tandanana pure
Tandanana bhala tandanana
Brahmam okate para brahmam okate para
Brahmam okate para prahmam okate..

SONG SUMMARY
This song describes how God is one. There are no
class distinctions like high or low, as God dwells in
all beings.

CHARANKAVI MUKUNDA DAS

SONG SUMMARY

In Bengal, Charankavi
Mukunda Das, also
known as Jogeshwar
Datta, who lived in the
19th or 20th century,
preached objectives
of
the
Swadeshi
movement
through
his songs and plays in
villages. Here is a composition by him—

The song says, “A tide has risen, a flood swells in the river”,
symbolising the flow of life. “Do not sleep — arise! Much time
has already slipped away. If you do not take the oars into
your own hands and steer the boat, all opportunities will be
lost, and you will be left with only regret for your inaction”.

ACTIVITY 8.6: VOICE FOR CHANGE
You also, can use music and poetry to bring about change.

The diverse tastes and choices of people across
different regions of India reflect the country’s rich
cultural mosaic. This diversity inspires a variety of
art forms, including music, musical instruments
and dance, creating expressions that resonate with
local traditions, beliefs and ways of life.

Different regions in India have different instruments
that are characteristics of those regions.

PERFORMANCE

There are many steps
that lead to a successful
performance.
It
is
helpful to remember
that there is more than
singing and playing.
There is a lot to contribute to a successful
performance even if you are not on stage.

 Where will it be?

This chapter is divided into three parts to
help you build a successful performance—
Plan, Prepare and Perform!

 Will the performance
have a theme and title?

PART A: PLAN
Like most activities, the planning phase
is the most important one while putting a
performance together. Follow all the steps in
the planning stage to think about what your
final performance can be.

ACTIVITY 9.1: VISUALISE A PERFORMANCE
To begin your planning, think of the following:
 When will it be?
 How long will it be?
 Who will be your
audience?

 Is this performance
intended for a
particular event
or occasion?
 Are there any
elements from other
performances that you
particularly enjoyed
and would like to
incorporate?

ACTIVITY 9.2: CREATE A SONG LIST
Work with your teacher to make a list of songs that could be used
for the performance. Everyone can contribute songs that they
know and like, that would work well for the performance. You
can choose songs from this book and other songs you already
know.
Here is a song that you can sing as an invocation or welcome
song.

SWAGATHAM SHUBHA SWAGATHAM
Swagatham shubha swagatham
Atha swagatham, shubha swagatham

Music has been a part of many important
events. The 1982 Asian Games, an
international sporting event, was held
in New Delhi. Swagatham shubha
swagatham, composed by renowned
Sitar maestro, Pandit
Ravi Shankar,
was sung at the

ACTIVITY 9.3: INCLUDING FOLK MUSIC
ODIA SONG
This is a folk song of the tribals of Koraput, Odisha. This is sung
widely during the celebration of Chaita Paraba. The song is
about coming together and celebrating the festival with love
and enthusiasm.
Ee la ya lori la la la lori
Ee la ya lori la la la lori
Lori danguda lori bulai de

Dances from Chhattisgarh

Keeping in mind your ideas for the
performance, look for a folk song from
a tradition other than yours. You can
research online, or ask musicians and
music educators you know. You can even
choose from what you have already learnt.
As an example, here’s a folk song for
you to learn:

Barane barane sita kaniya
Barane barane sita kaniya
Sita kaniya magi aailu
Lakhmi kaniya bibha hai bu
Sita kaniya bibha hai bu
Aache boile aache bala ya
Puruba neeti ke magi aailu
Puruba neeti ke magi aailu
Lori k lori la la lori
Lori k lori la la lori

Lori k lori la la la lori
Betu danguda betu bulai de
Betu danguda betu bulai de
Barane barane Lakhmi kaniya
Barane barane Lakhmi kaniya
Lakhmi kaniya magi aailu
Nai baile naib ala ya
Puruba neeti ke buli aailu
Puruba neeti ke buli aailu
Ee la ya lori la la lori
Ee la ya lori la la lori

PART B: PREPARE
ACTIVITY 9.4: REHEARSAL AND FEEDBACK
 Once you have chosen your song, or set of
songs, practise it.
 When you are performing with a group,
practise together so everyone works well.
 Find ways to use the elements you learnt in
Chapter 1, such as singing in parts or in canon,
or using body percussion and synchronisation.

 When you are ready, perform for your teacher
or a friend and ask for feedback. This will help
you enhance your strengths and work on your
weaknesses.
 Make a practise plan, based on the feedback you
have received.

 If you are a vocalist, think of the lyrics of the
song and the kind of emotion and story you
are trying to convey.
 If you are an instrumentalist, think about how
you can play with dynamics and feeling. Know
when you are the lead and when you are
supporting others.
 Find musical parts for all the performers. See
how each person is using their strengths and
making the performance better. If you do
not have instruments, see how else you can
support the performance — sometimes you
can even use a stick to keep the beat.

 How can you best use the performance space?
 Do you require any props?
 Would you need an anchor to announce and
engage the audience?
 Are chairs needed for the audience?
 What else is needed for a successful
performance? Plan out every step and prepare.

On the day of the final
performance — welcome the
audience and introduce the show,
present the performance and end
it with a thank you message. Try
to record the performance.
After your performance has
ended get constructive feedback
from your audience and discuss
it with your team.
Congratulations! You are now a
young performer!

 How will you let people know or advertise about
the performance?
 Can you create eye-catching posters that can be
put up around your school? Use ideas from your
Visual Art classes.

DANCE AND
SCULPTURE

Dancing Body in Sculptures
The Vishnudharmottara Purana emphasises the interrelation and
interdependence between various art forms.
Dated around 400 to 600 CE, the end of the Gupta
period, is also known as the golden age of Indian arts.
It understands the importance of spatial concepts of
the performing body.
In this text, a discussion occurs between King
Vajra and Markandeya on painting and drama
in a memorable verse. It states the manifold
interrelationship of performing and visual art.
Sage Markandeya instructs, “One who does
not know the laws of painting (chitra) can never
understand the laws of image-making (shilpa); and,
it is difficult to understand the laws of painting
(chitra) without any knowledge of the technique of
dancing (nrtya) ...”.
The precision of geometrical shapes in dance
and sculptures was probably worked out due to this
interdisciplinary understanding.

Geometrical shapes in dance
Dance and mathematics often intertwine with
geometrical shapes, playing a key role in creating
balanced and visually appealing movements.
When observing postures in dance, you can
identify various geometrical shapes and angles
formed by the body, such as triangles, circles and lines.

You have been learning your dance movements
with the usage of different body parts.
Small body parts, medium body parts and big
body parts which are mentioned in dance texts.
You are familiar with identifying shapes created
by upper body bends or torsos.

observe how your arms create various geometrical
angles when it is used in dance.
Note to the Teacher: Connecting these actions to the
lessons in geometry would help the child understand
the concepts of lines and angles in an enjoyable way.
The geometry teacher could also be involved in
planning this.

Our Indian sculptures showcase their splendid
artistry through intricate stances, expressive
features and graceful hastas (hand gestures).
Hastas in sculpture impart an artistic aesthetic to
the body and convey emotions effectively without
the use of words.
Can you see hastas in the pictures given below,
try them out and see if you can match them with the
hasta illustrations? It is important to understand
that these hastas are dance, some hastas are

Navarasa: The feeling of the
nine emotions
Emotions and expressions are an integral part of Indian
dance. These basic emotions give rise to an emotive
ambience that is enjoyed by everyone. That is rasa.

श‍ृृ ङ्गाारहाास्यकरुणाा रौौद्रवीीरभयाानकाःः  ।
बीीभत्सााद्भुतसं
ु ंज्ञौौ चेेत्यष्टौौ नााट्येे रसाःः  स्मृृताःः  ॥ १५॥
śhṛingāra-hāsya-karuṇā-raudra-veera-bhayānaka
bibhatsa-adbhuta-sangyau chet-aṣhṭau naṭye
rasāh smṛitah
— Natyashastra
Beauty, laughter, sorrow, anger, courage, fear,
disgust and wonder are the eight rasas in natya.

This is the shloka from the Natyashastra that talks
about eight rasas. The ninth rasa, shanta was included
later by Abhinava Gupta in 10th century CE.
Do you remember the names of the nine emotions
we learnt in Kriti, Grade 6? Do you remember
expressing them?

115 | DANCE AND SCULPTURE

116 | KRITI

Let us remember the nine emotions and expressions:

How do you feel when
you smell the fragrance of
flowers? — śhṛingāra

Does looking at squirrels
and their activities make you
happy and bring a smile to
your face? — hāsya

Is there sadness when
someone destroys those
flowers? — karuṇā

Does it make you angry when
someone cuts down the trees
in the garden? — raudra

You bravely rise in protest
to stop the destruction of the
trees and plants — veera

There may be perils in the
garden. Suppose there is
a snake in the branches of
a tree, what will be your
emotion? — bhayānaka
Some plants are decaying
on the ground and
unfortunately, they give out
a pungent smell that may
disgust you — bibhatsa

But the beauty of nature is
always wondrous
— adbhuta

Let us all find peace in
nature — śhānta

ACTIVITY 10.4: MATCHING EMOTIONS WITH OUR CHORES
Materials
Two bowls of chits
 Bowl 1: Nine emotional states (happiness,
sadness, anger, surprise, fear, excitement, calm,
confused, proud).
 Bowl 2: Daily activities (e.g., brushing teeth,
dressing, going to school, eating lunch, doing
homework, doing yoga).

Instructions
1. Each child picks a chit from bowl 1 and bowl 2.
2. The child then enacts the daily activity they
picked, performing it along with the emotional
state from the other chit.
Include hand gestures with this for effective
enactment.
Example: If you pick ‘confused’ emotional state
from bowl 1 and ‘do homework’ as a daily activity
from bowl 2, enact as if you are willing to do
homework but don’t want to do it right now (you
can scratch your head, leave your pen and hold it
again, close the book and open it).

DANCE VOCABULARY
AND TECHNIQUES

Nritta, Nritya and Natya
Dance comprises many units which are beautifully connected together.
Some have joyous movements, some narrate a story or a situation and
some tell the full story. Below are the definitions of nritta, nritya and
natya given from the treatise, Abhinaya Darpana, a text widely followed
by classical dancers.
You will explore the vocabulary of nritta
and nritya in this chapter.
नृृत्तंं — भाावााभि नयहीीनंं तुु नृृत्तमि त्यभि धीीयतेे ॥ १५॥
nṛttah bhāvābhinayahīnam tu nṛttamityabhidhīyate
Nritta consists of dance with only movements
without any specific emotive content or narrative.

The most important unit of a dance form
are the basic steps that need to be learnt.
These steps form the dance vocabulary. The
various steps are then strung together to make
a dance.

नृृत्यंं — रसभाावव्यञ्जनाादि युुक्तंं नृृत्यमि तीीर्ययतेे ॥ १६॥
nṛtyam rasabhāvavyañjanādiyuktaṁ nṛtyamitīryate
Nritya combines dance with narration of stories
or situations with rasa and bhava.
नाट्यं — नाट्यं तन्नाटकं चैव पूज्यं पूर््वकथायुतम् ।
nāṭyaṁ : nāṭyaṁ tannāṭakaṁ caiva pūjyaṁ
pūrvakathāyutam
Natya is a dance drama where all aspects of
performance are integrated to narrate a full story.

Nritya
In Kriti, Grade 6, you started with a shloka from the
Abhinaya Darpana, that gave the concept of the use
of hand gestures. This is connected to narration and
concentration of the mind in bhava to evoke rasa for a
successful performance. Let us recap the shloka and its
meaning to present your nritya.

यतोो हस्त स्ततोो दृष्टि  | यतोो दृष्टि  स्ततोो मनःः
यतोो मनःः स्ततोो भााव: | यतोो भााव स्ततोो रस:
yato hastastato dṛiṣhṭi, yato dṛiṣhṭistato manah
yato manastato bhāvah, yathobhāvastato rasah
Wherever the hand moves, the eyes follow;
Wherever the eyes go, the mind follows.
Where the mind is directed there bhava is
created; Where there is bhava, rasa unfolds.

Nritya

Conversation using Hasta
In Chapter 1, you learnt how hastas were
skillfully used in sculptures to convey
expressions
and
communicate
specific
messages. These hastas play a vital role in
portraying emotions, and narratives in visual
and symbolic ways.
You are familiar with the usages of asamyuta
hastas which you have done earlier.

Can you relate this to the description of nritya given
earlier?

Note: Please refer to the Kriti, Grade 6 for

usages from Kriti, Grade 6).

DO NOT BE ANGRY AND FIGHT

Demonstrate a meaningful sentence using both
asamyuta and samyuta hastas in front of your
friends, and let them guess its meaning.
Try short phrases first like:
WELCOME, MY FRIEND

Welcome

be angry

fight

IN THE FOREST, THERE WAS A DEER

a deer

THERE ARE FISHES IN THE RIVER

together

Jumps and Pirouettes (spins)
Then, combine further to make
full sentences. You can combine
hand gestures as per your
creativity.
Example:
 Welcome, my friend. Do not be
angry and fight, let us go and
play together.
 In the forest, there was a deer,
flying birds and fish in the river.

In how many ways can you jump and spin in
dance?
Jumps, utplavana, pirouettes and bhramaris (spins) play an important
role in a dance performance. The execution of jumps and pirouettes
is another unit of dance vocabulary, which can be used in pure dance
or to enhance emotive content.
Both jumps and pirouettes can be performed in rhythm with
music beats, enhancing the overall impact of a dance. In a dance
with stories, it can be without rhythm.

Have fun conversations —
1. Do you know Karate? What are
the different postures used in it?
2. Do you realise that it can
be an important

Yakshagana, the artist performs pirouettes while
standing on knees, often executing them multiple
times. Kalbelia, a traditional dance from Rajasthan
is performed in a circular motion while taking

pirouettes in a circular path. In the Pung Cholom
dance of Manipur, the drummers jump and spin
holding a drum. Kathak, the classical dance form
of northern India is characterised by the spins the
dancer executes.

Movements of Hips in Dance
After exploring the movement of upper torso, lower torso, arms and
legs you will now see the movement of the hips and the kati — another
body part mentioned in the Natyasastra.
Hip movements in Indian dance tradition play they are characterised by grace, precision and fluidity.
a vital role in expressing the rhythm and emotion
Below are the hip movements intricately woven into
of the song. While their specific use and style can Indian dance traditions.
vary across different classical and folk dance forms,

Twisting of the hip

Side to side

Back and front

Garbha uses the movement of
twisting in its style of turning.

In many folk dances of our country,
you can observe side-to-side hip
movements, for example, the
Kalbelia.

A few Indian dance traditions feature
back-and-forth hip movements. You
can observe such movements in
dances like the Bihu and Chhau.

Traditions and Transformations
Beyond Boundaries
In Kriti, Grade 6, we discussed
many dance traditions and the
role of male and female dancers.
In solo traditions, the solo
dancer plays different roles and
switches from one character
to another. There was a strong
tradition of female dancers all
over India, who enacted stories
Vedantam
and poetries, taking on various
Satyanarayana Sarma
roles. Simultaneously, there
were male dancers who sometimes performed in the
garb of a woman. One such personality is the famous
Kuchipudi dancer, Vedantam Satyanarayana Sarma,
who performed in female costume.
In traditional dance-drama traditions male dancers
often take on the role of women and their costume
decides the portrayal of the character. Some dance
traditions also use masks for portrayals like Chhau
which we learnt about in Kriti, Grade 6.
We will learn about two more such performance
traditions where men have traditionally been playing
female characters. Though now both traditions are
welcoming women into their traditional practises.

Bhagavata Mela Natakam from
Melattur, Tamil Nadu
A dance-drama tradition of
southern India. This form to
originated in the village of
Kuchipudi in Andhra Pradesh,
the main protagonists were Tirtha
Narayana Yati and Siddhendra
Yogi.
Some
bhagavatars
moved from Andhra after the
N. Sreekanth
decline
of
the
Vijayanagara
Natarajan
Empire to Melattur, Thanjavur
patronised by the Nayaka kings and thus started the
Melattur tradition. Famous Sanskrit scholars, Gopal
Krishna Shastri and his son Venkatrama Shastri became
disciples of saint Narayana Tirtha Yati. Patrons, Achyutappa
Nayak and Sevappa Nayak gifted the village Mellatur to
these Brahmans and it became a centre of fine arts. Early
20th century CE, the most famous bhagavatar was Natesha
Iyer, and after his death, the troupe was continued under
G. Swaminathan. Other important persons were Balu
Bhagavathar and T.V. Natesh Bhagavathar. E. Krishna
Iyer was instrumental in reviving the tradition with the
Madras Music Academy in 1950.
The main performance was Prahlada Charitam
at the Varadaraja Perumal temple during Narasimha
Jayanti in May or June. Conventionally male dancers
play the role of women.

Ankiya Bhaona from Assam

Ankiya Nat is a dance-drama tradition from Assam
which developed in the 15th century CE. Following
the tradition of singing and dancing of Vaishnavism,
namghars and sattaras were established where the
monks who were all males performed stories of
the Bhagavata purana through music and dance. A
certain kind of presentation of ankiya nat is called
bhaona which combines live instruments, singers,
dance and elaborate costumes in production.
Masks are important props in this nat tradition.
The bhaona begins with a Sanskrit benediction
and the songs are in Brajaboli. The most important
namghar is the Kamalabari Sattara in Majuli,
Assam.

ACTIVITY 12.2

Sita mask in Ankiya Bhaona

Purulia Chhau

My character determines costume and
my movement: Going beyond boundaries
Decide on a character, for example, a lady’s
movement or mask which can include
side-to-side hip movements or a peacock
costume, or mask which can include front
and back hip movements. Earlier, you learnt
mask-making in theatre. Can you recall that for
making masks?
Now, choose your hip movement and/or a
mask to portray a character of your choice.

Dance Traditions in Transition and Transformation
During cultural reconstruction with the nationalist
movement, there was a regeneration of classical dances
and emergence of contemporary movement vocabulary.

Rabindranath Tagore
Rabindranath
Tagore
established
one of the first fine arts universities,
the
Vishwabharati
University
in Shantiniketan in 1921. It was
instrumental in developing a new
dance vocabulary, drawing from our
traditional dances that came to be
known as Rabindra Nritya. He pioneered
professional dance for women.

Now, try to dance two lines of a dance in
Rabindra Nritya.

Uday Shankar
Uday Shankar was perhaps
the pioneer of modern
Indian dance. He began
his dance career in 1920,
dancing with Anna Pavlova
with no formal training. He
creatively
amalgamated
various dance traditions of
India from classical, folk,
traditional, and tribal to present a completely
new dance style which has come to be known
as the Uday Shankar
Style. His dance film
Kalpana made in
1948 has remained
unparalleled to date.

Choreography:
from stage to screen
You have been getting used to the term
choreography in dance. Now, you can
see the same on screen.
Indian cinema throughout its
existence has used many Indian dances
in its choreography. Notable ones
being Mughal-e-Azam, choreographed
by Lacchu Maharaj and jhanak jhanak
payal baje by Gopi Krishna. Many south
Indian actresses were accomplished
Bharatanatyam dancers and danced
beautifully
in
movies.
Bharat
Ratna awarded, M S Subbulakshmi
had a flair for abhinaya and
performed
such
sequences
in
many of her films. In recent times,
the famous kahe ched ched mohe
choreography by Birju Maharaj
became very popular. Beautiful Garba
sequences and many other folk forms
are also seen in many movies in every
part of the country.

ACTIVITY 12.3: MY CREATIVE DANCE
Develop your creative dance using the patterns of movement
learnt till now. Divide yourselves into groups of 1, 2, 3 and 4,
respectively. Each group will work out different phrases of
movement. Choose your composition, music swar and rhythm
variations that you have practiced earlier. You can also choose
a situation or represent a character and add emotions. Now, put
together one complete dance joining the dance phrases of each
group. You have, thus, gone through the complete process of
composing and choreographing a dance.

NATYA

Natya is storytelling through performance. You have read the
description of this earlier in the book and read about two natya
traditions.
In this chapter, you will explore how dance elements can be
incorporated into natya.
A story can be made into a performance
with elements of dance and choreography,
dialogues, musical elements with songs,
musical instruments, and costumes and
make up. Discuss about telling a story and
how you can incorporate dance movements
in natya with your friends. A story is given
below for you to consider or you can choose
your own story for presentation and have
fun putting it together with choreography.
So, let us dive into this chapter by reading
a story and then dancing to the story. That
will be interesting and enjoyable.

Note to the Teacher: Do this activity
according to your regional
languages and practices.

One lazy afternoon, Grandma gathered the children to tell
them the story of Krishna and the snake Kaliya. She began her
story in a soft animated voice bringing the story alive with her
dramatic narration.

144 | KRITI

“Long ago, on the
banks of the river
Kalindi, there lived
a monstrous serpent
called Kaliya Naag. He
was a terrible creature,
hissing and coiling,
frightening everyone
who came near him.
Even birds would not
fly over the river, and
children
were
too
scared to play by its
banks. But one day,
little Krishna arrived.”
“Now, Krishna was not afraid of anything. He saw
the frightened children and decided to help them.
He climbed the tallest tree by the river, flute in hand,
and began to play it. The music was so sweet and
enchanting that it flowed over the water like sunlight
on ripples. Even Kaliya couldn’t resist. The great
serpent rose from the river, swaying to the melody,
his anger forgotten and his eyes shut in joy. Then,
Krishna leapt onto Kaliya’s hood and began to dance.
Oh, how he danced! His tender feet moved nimbly
with such grace and rhythm that even Kaliya, fierce
as he was, couldn’t help but join in. Soon, birds were

singing again, animals came out of hiding, and the
children clapped and cheered. Kaliya calmed down
and happily, slipped away into the river, never to
trouble anyone again.”
The children listened with rapt attention and then
excitedly asked grandma to help them enact this natya.
She replied, “Yes we have to plan and design
the whole story, choreograph it with dance, music,
enactment, costumes and stage design. You see
children, through music and dance, even the wildest
heart can be calmed. Natya — our beautiful art of
storytelling — isn’t just for entertainment. It teaches,
it heals, and it brings peace”.
All traditional performances begin with a
salutation to seek blessings of the Almighty. Here you
will see references of salutation and benediction with
reference to natya.
She said, “In our traditions, every play begins and
ends with gratitude. Before the performance, we seek
blessings for its success — just as we start our day
with a prayer or sing during the morning assembly
at school. It helps us focus our mind and brings a
sense of calm. The salutation is an essential part of
any play’s preliminaries in the Indian natya tradition.
Let us learn some prayers which can be recited as a
salutation to the almighty and as benediction after
the conclusion of the natya”.

Here is one example which you can use as a salutation
in your performance or you can select your own.

Sujanara — by good people

Salutation

Oh elephant faced god! I pray for you. You are
the Son of Goddess, Gowri (Parvati). You are
worshiped by all the three worlds. You are the
protector of all good people such as sages.

ಗಜವದನಾ ಬೇಡುವೆ ಗೌರಿ ತನಯ ।
ತ್ರಿ ಜಗ ವಂದಿತನೆ ಸುಜನರ ಪೊರೆವನೇ ।।
ಸರಸಿಜನಾಭ ಶ್್ರರೀ ಪುರಂಧರ ವಿಠ್್ಠಲನ ।
ನಿರುತ ನೆನೆಯುವಂತೆ ನೀ ದಯಮಾಡೋ ೋ ।।

Porevane — protector

Meaning of last stanza
Sarasija Nabha — one who has lotus in his navel
Sri Purandara Vittalana — Lord Vishnu (pen
name of purandara daasa)

Gajavadana beduve gowri tanaya||
Trijaga vanditane sujanara porevane||

Niruta — always

Sarasijanabha sri Purandara Vittalana||
Niruta neneyuvante nee dayamaado ||

Neneyuvante — make me remember

— Purandara Das, Devaranama
(Kannada language)

Nee — you
Dayamaado — shower blessings
Oh Lord Vishnu (Purandara Vittala) the one who
has lotus in his navel, shower your blessings to
remember you at each and every movement.

Meaning
Gajavadana — one who has elephant face (Ganesha)
Beduve — I pray
Gowri Tanaya — son of Gowri
Trijaga — the three worlds
Vanditane — worshipped

145 | Natya

Benediction
Similarly, all performances ends with a
benediction. She ended by saying, “And when the
play ends, we bow to the audience to thank them
for their time, and attention. After all, what is a
performance without those who come to watch

146 | KRITI

it? This exchange of respect is what makes natya so
special — it is not just about the story but about the
connection it creates between those who perform
and those who watch.”

ॐ सर्वेे भवन्तुु सुुखि नःःसर्वेे सन्तुु नि राामयाःः ।
सर्वेे भद्रााणि  पश्यन्तुु माा कश्चि द्दुः ः खभााग्भवेेत।
oṁ sarve bhavantu sukhinaḥ
sarve santu nirāmayāh
sarve bhadrāṇi paśhyantu
mā kaśhchidduḥkhabhāgbhavet

Here is an example of a benediction.

May all living beings be at peace,
May no one suffer from diseases,
May all have prosperous divinity,
May no one suffer from sorrows

ACTIVITY 14.1: PLANNING THE PERFORMANCE
You will note down all dance elements that can be
incorporated into this natya format.
Divide yourselves into groups. Each group will
work out certain dances for the story. The different
sections can be:

Movement Selection
Think and discuss the appropriate dance movements
to express emotions, and enhance the natya.
Following must be added to the performance —

 Steps
 Rhythm and different beats (like 5, 6 and 7
beats) for appropriate scenes.
 Navarasa (bhayanaka for children, raudra for
Kaliya, veera for Krishna, etc.)
 Appropriate body movements: Upper and lower
torso, hip movements, and so on
 Hand gestures, animal hastas, jumps and spins

An example of how sections can be divided in
reference to the story is given below.

 Movements of Kaliya and reactions of the
children: Can you use the twisting and circular
hip movements for Kaliya. How will the children
show fear?

Note to The TeacherS
Dear Teacher,

Visual Arts pedagogy would need to

Let us take our students deeper into the fascinating
world of visual arts, ideas and communication. In
this grade, the focus is on broadening their exposure
to visual art processes and traditions while honing
their skills and techniques. It is important that you
read every chapter carefully. You can modify the
activities to suit your local context and the specific
needs of your students.

1. Use storytelling and everyday examples to introduce
concepts and processes.
2. Encourage students to freely express their original
ideas, imaginations, emotions and curiosities in
their artwork.
3. Encourage students to create original artwork
inspired by their observations of everyday life and
experiences, rather than copying images from other
sources.
4. Allow students to explore, investigate, experiment,
collaborate and have dialogues in the classroom.
5. Include outdoor activities and field trips to explore
and observe the life and culture around them.
6. Organise visits to museums, heritage monuments
and melas.
7. Invite local artists and craftspeople for interactive
sessions, workshops for hands-on experience.
8. Inculcate simple habits of cleaning up after working,
putting back used materials and maintain art
materials with care.
9. Encourage students’ participation and decisionmaking in selecting artwork for classroom display
or exhibitions.

To create the best learning experience for every
student consider the following points.
The Visual Arts classroom requires
1. Ample space for students to work comfortably.
2. Sufficient light and ventilation.
3. Organised storage and easy access to art
materials, tools, basic stationery and
audio-visual facilities.
4. Space for showcasing and exhibiting artwork
periodically.

Visual arts, assessment should be based on the
following Competencies for the Middle Stage.
C-1.1 Expresses confidently their personal and everyday
life experiences through various visual art forms.
C-1.2 Demonstrates flexibility in the process of
collaboratively developing visual arts practice.
C-2.1 Creates visual artwork based on situations or
stories that challenge stereotypes observed in their
surroundings (such as gender roles).
C-2.2 Connects visual imagery, symbols, and visual
metaphors with personal experiences, emotions,
and imaginations.

C-3.1 Demonstrates care and makes informed
choices, while using various materials,
tools and techniques in the Visual Arts.
C-3.2 Refines ideas and techniques of visual
expression from the stage of planning to
the final presentation, and reviews the
entire process.
C-4.1 Demonstrates familiarity with various
local and regional forms of art.
C-4.2 Describes the life and work of a few local
artists in their region and across India.

OBJECTS IN ICONS
AND SYMBOLS

Visuals help us communicate
with one another. Examine the
visuals on this page. Each one
gives you information quickly
and directly. Such visuals are
called icons.
An icon is a simplified visual representation of an
object, place or idea. Icons do not show too many
details. For example, a mobile phone display has
icons depicting the clock, remaining battery charge,
network connections, applications, and so on. Below
are a few other icons that you come across regularly.

In this chapter, you
will learn how objects
can be represented as
icons and symbols to
convey information. You
will explore how these
visual elements are
used in logos, signages
and even as emojis
while texting. Through
various activities, you
will practise drawing
objects to make them
appear two-dimensional
or
three-dimensional
and learn to convert
them into icons.
You will also explore
how objects take on
other meanings when
used as symbols.

Notice how the details
in these objects have
been
removed
to
create icons.

156 | Kriti

ACTIVITY 15.1: UNDERSTANDING SIMPLE ICONS
Look at the two icons of the fork and spoon.
The positive space depicts the objects.
The negative space is the blank space.
Thus, black is positive in one image and negative
in the other. Observe the positive and negative
spaces in the other icons. Icons generally have a
lot of negative space.

CREATE STENCILS FROM THE OBJECTS
Materials: Old newspapers or magazines, scissors, plain A4 paper, pencil and eraser.

1

Step 1: Look
through old
newspapers
or magazines
and identify
two or three
objects that are
completely and
clearly visible.

2

Step 2: Now,
carefully
highlight the
outline of this
object.

3

Step 3: Choose
an object
and cut out
the section
containing it.

4

Step 4: Cut
the object
along the
outline. This
is called a
stencil.

5

Step 5: On
a sheet of
paper, use
this stencil
to draw the
object.

6

Step 6: Colour
within the
outline, and
notice the
positive and
negative space,
thus created.

Show this to your friends and ask them to identify the object. Repeat stencilling with other objects. Can your
friends identify the object from the shape created by the stencil?

ACTIVITY 15.2: DRAWING ONE OBJECT IN DIFFERENT WAYS
An object can be drawn using different techniques to create two-dimensional or
three-dimensional forms.
See the example below.
A musical instrument made
by a student

Contour of the
object
 This is an outline.
 Looks transparent.
 Object looks
two-dimensional.

Silhouette of the
object
 This is a coloured flat
shape.
 Looks opaque.
 Object looks

Shading the object

Icon of the object

 Captures light and
shade through tonal
variations using
techniques like
cross-hatching and
stippling.

 Simplified image
with essential
details.
 Object looks
two-dimensional.

 Object looks
three-dimensional.

Choose an object and get ready to draw it.
Materials: Five sheets of A5 size (half of A4) paper, sharpened pencil, eraser, colours and pen.

MAKE A CONTOUR OF AN OBJECT OF YOUR CHOICE
Take an A5 paper and a pencil.
Step 1: Observe and measure.

Step 2: Draw the contour.

 Keep the object at more than 2–3 feet distance.

 Keep looking at the object as you draw
each part till you complete its contour.

 Closely observe the shape and size of the object.
 Use your pencil as a measuring tool as shown.
 Place your thumb on the pencil, align it with the
object to measure its parts.
 Measure and mark the proportions of the object on
your paper.

Note to the Teacher

•

•

Each student should individually choose
an object to draw.
Ensure that they use the same object
for each artwork in this activity.

MAKE A SILHOUETTE OF YOUR OBJECT

SHADING YOUR OBJECT
Draw your object and make it appear threedimensional using these two shading techniques:
1. Cross-hatching is a shading technique that uses
criss-cross lines.
Closely overlap lines in different directions to
create darker tones.

Silhouette

Loosely overlap lines to create lighter tones.

Take an A5 paper and a pencil.
1. Draw the contour of the same object again or
trace it from the first contour drawing.
2. Colour inside the contour to make it look flat.
3. Use a different colour to fill the negative space
around the object.
Optional: On another A5 sheet, make an inverse
image of the silhouette by switching the colours of
the positive and negative spaces.

Cross-hatching

Stippling

2. Stippling is a shading technique that uses dots.
Place the dots close to one another to create
darker tones.

Cross-hatching

Stippling

Increase the space between dots to create
lighter tones.

Use a separate sheet of A5
paper for each technique.
Step 1: Take the same object
you chose for making a
silhouette and place it in
front of you.
Step 2: Observe and draw
its contour.
Step 3: Observe how light
falls on the object.
Step 4: Create light and dark
tones using cross-hatching
technique.

MAKE AN ICON OF YOUR OBJECT
Gather your drawings — the contour, silhouettes, cross-hatching and
stippling.
Which of these will you use to make an icon?
Remember that an icon is a simplified image. But it also needs to be
identified quickly. It should, therefore, contain clear shapes and have
only important details. Sometimes the silhouette of the object can be the
icon.
Make your icon on an A5 sheet and complete it with colour.
It takes practice and keen observation to be able to make good icons. If
you had to use your icon to communicate information, what would it be?

Step 5: Complete your work
and keep it aside.
Step 6: Take another A5
paper and draw the contour
of the object.
Step 7: Create light and dark
tones using stippling.

ACTIVITY 15.3: ICONS FOR SIGNAGES
Signage informs us where a space is and what it is
used for. In this activity, you will create signages
using icons of objects for your school.
Step 1: Choose a space in your school such as the
entrance, washrooms, play area, a space for eating
meals, library, a space to keep your bags, shoes,
and so on.

Step 5: Create the icon in two or more ways.
Step 6: Choose the icon that expresses your purpose
best and can be used as a signage for the chosen
space. Create this icon on an A5 sheet.
Show the signage to your friends and ask them
what they think about it.

Step 2: Make a list of the objects that come to your
mind when you think of this space.
Step 3: Choose the most important object in this
space. For example, the door in an exit signage
signifies its importance. If you have chosen two
objects, try different ways of combining them to
create one icon. For example, signage for a dining
area can have a spoon and a fork; signage for an
art room can have a palette and a brush.
Step 4: Remember that an icon is a simplified
drawing that represents the object.
 Experiment with contours and sihouettes.
 Add only those details that characterise the
object. Use only one colour.

Note: Think of the objects that you use regularly
while creating icons. For example, you may not use
a fork and spoon when you eat. So can you think of
alternative icons to represent your food?

ACTIVITY 15.4: OBJECTS AS SYMBOLS
You have seen that images of objects are
created for various purposes. These could
be signages for spaces or icons in your
surroundings. Objects also become symbols.
Symbols have a deeper meaning and
represent ideas or emotions. They may not
directly relate to the visual they represent.
The Dharma Chakra forms
the centre of our national
flag. It is a navy blue
wheel with 24 spokes.
It is a depiction of the
‘wheel of the law’ taken
from the Lion Capital of
Sarnath made in the 3rd
century BCE by the Mauryan
Emperor Ashoka.

The symbol of the round
spectacles in this logo of
Swachhata Abhiyan represents
Mahatma Gandhi. The bridge
of the spectacles is the national
tricolour. It signifies the entire
nation uniting to achieve the
vision of Mahatma Gandhi for a clean India.
Everyday objects like spectacles and a wheel. These
become powerful symbols when their meaning is
accepted to represent larger ideas. Can you think of other
objects that are used as symbols?
Look at the logos of companies, institutions and
political parties where you see objects used as symbols.
What meanings do they symbolise?
Is there a difference between icons and symbols?

 Blue represents the sky and ocean.

Remember that symbols have a deeper meaning.

 Wheel represents progress.

Icons can also be symbols if they are given more meanings.
Symbols need not resemble what they stand for.

 The spokes represent 24 hours
of the day.

For example, Indians can associate round spectacles with
Mahatma Gandhi, his values and work. People who cannot
make that connection may simply see it as a pair of spectacles.

Colour is an important element of visual art. With regular practice,
you will improve your techniques of making, mixing and working with
colours. You will learn to use the colour wheel not only for your work,
but also to appreciate other artworks.

IN

Colours are visible because of light. When light
changes, the appearance of colours also changes.
A bright red tomato may look dull and dark in a
dimly lit room. When there is too much light, everything appears white.
When there is no light, everything appears black. In visual art, such
effects of light are shown by creating tints, shades and tones of colour.

Nature showers us with colour every day. A
rainbow displays the entire range of colours the
human eye can see.

The colour spectrum visible
to the human eye

Not all people see colours the same way. It is important to be
sensitive to how each person sees colour. Those who have colour
vision impairment, commonly called colour blindness, see a few
colours differently. Red may appear brown or they may find it difficult
to differentiate between blue and green. There are many visual artists
and designers with vision impairment of various
kinds. They have excelled in their careers by finding
creative solutions to work with their impairments.

For example, green is a
secondary colour that is
made by mixing yellow and
blue (primary colours).

The tertiary colours made from green are:

Miniature paintings are of many styles and
are generally small in size. In India, these were
initially done on palm leaves. From the 12th
century CE, artists began to use paper as the base
for miniature paintings. Their themes included
religious texts, mythology, nature, portraiture
and court life.

The word ‘miniature’ originates
from 'minium’, a red-coloured
pigment that was used to
draw outlines and write text
in medieval manuscripts.

DO YOU

The table below tells you about the source of
some of the colours used in miniatures. These were
processed and mixed with gum extracted from the

Care for Art Materials and Tools
It is important to take care of the space we work in,
as well as the materials and tools we use for artwork.


Always clean your brushes, palettes and other
tools thoroughly with soap after every use.



Close paint tubes, bottles, sketch pens and
markers with their caps, to prevent colour from
drying.



Store all materials in an organised way so that
they can be easily found and used by others too.

What makes a baby’s face appear different from an
adult’s face?
It is the proportion.

Draw a face using the guidelines for proportion.
Use the same proportions to draw the head in
different angles.

See the image and analyse how the proportions
change as a person grows.

You can use your index finger to measure various parts
of your face.

Math in Art
Look at the pictures and write their facial proportions
in mathematical expressions as fractions or ratios!
Take your math teacher’s help.

Measure the length of your nose and use the same to
measure your ears, eyes, forehead, etc.
Here are some interesting things that you will discover:
 The space between two eyes is another eye.
 The ears are positioned
between the level of your
eyebrows and the tip of
your nose.

KNOW?

ACTIVITY 17.3: DRAWING FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
Step 1: Ask your friends to pose
for a few minutes in different
expressions. They can show a
funny face, sad face, laughing
face, worried face, etc. Observe
how the eyes, eyebrows, mouth
and jawline change for each
expression.
Step 2: Draw four to five faces
while paying attention to the
proportions.
Step 3: Modify the eyes,
eyebrows and mouth to create
different facial expressions.
Step 4: Have fun creating your
own emojis.

ASSESSMENT
1. Observe and depict the
ratios and proportions of
the human head.
2. Depict a variety of facial
expressions to express
emotions.

ACTIVITY 17.4: LET US TRAVEL BACK IN TIME!

Imagine you have entered a time machine and
have been transported to 8th century CE. You find
yourself in front of this massive rock-cut temple
sculpture at Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu.
You see the sculptors at work. They tell you
that they are carving the ‘Descent of Ganga’. Some
others tell you the story of ‘Arjuna’s Penance’.

As you watch them work, you imagine the river
flows down the cleft between the two boulders and
all life gathering around the river. The sculpture
brings alive the stories and myths celebrating life
around water. Although some figures can be seen
very clearly, others look unfinished. Each scene
draws you in and you see more.

FACES IN RELIEF USING CLAY
Swishhhh! ... The time machine snapped back to the
21st century and you have this book in your hand.
The sculptures in the Shore temple of Mahabalipuram
have eroded over time. You see various body movements
and props in the hands of people carved on this rock. The
characters can be identified, however, the facial expressions
are not clear.

A relief is a sculpture
which stays connected
to its base. Its back
is usually flat or not
sculpted.

DO YOU
KNOW?

Look at the pictures carefully. Locate the
same characters in the bigger picture on the
previous page.
Since you have learnt to draw facial
expressions, reimagine their faces.
Sketch each face with expressions on
separate sheets of 15 cm × 15 cm size.

Kinnaras — Half-human and
half-bird/animal

Gandharvas — Celestial singers, musicians
or dancers

After completing your drawings, choose
one, cut it out and keep it ready for your clay

Process of making relief in clay
1

Take some natural clay. If it is dry, you need
to soak it in some water for a day so that it
becomes soft and moist.

2

Knead
your
clay
(just like you knead
dough), and remove
stones, pebbles and
other impurities in
the process.

3

4

Your clay should be of
a suitable consistency
to work with. Too
much
water
will
make it sticky and too
little water will make
it crack.

5

Roll it smoothly
using a rolling pin
to create a slab
of approximately
15
cm
length,
15 cm width and
3 cm height.

6

For modelling, use tools made of clay, or
experiment with blunt kitchen cutlery like
spoons, butter knives, icecream sticks, etc.

7

With a pointed
tool, gently trace
your paper cut
out onto the slab.

8

Start removing
a thin layer of
clay from the
background, so
that the surface
of the face looks
raised.

9

Gather the clay that you have removed in
the shape of a ball and keep it moist.

Make a ball with the
clay and flatten it
with your palm.

10 Add

11

this clay to
build facial features
like the forehead,
eyebrows, eyelids,
eyes, cheeks, nose,
mouth, chin, etc.

Different clay parts can be joined by making the
clay into a smooth paste called slip.

Moisten your slab by sprinkling water lightly
every now and then.

Reflect on your process and respond to these
questions below.

Technical Tip

Marks are made on the desired area to make
the surface rough. Slip is applied (which acts like a
glue) and the other part is joined.

12

Use your tools to refine the features, add
textures and create expressions that you want
on the face.

13

Complete your work and make a hole on the top
of the slab with a pencil. This will help you hang
your relief.

14

Allow it to dry for a
few days.

1. Did your artwork develop cracks during the
process?

2. What could the reasons be?

Optional: You can paint your clay relief after it is
completely dry.

ACTIVITY 17.5: EVERYBODY HAS A BEAUTIFUL STORY
The ‘Descent of Ganga’ shows a wide variety of
people with different body types. Look at how
people have been depicted in different styles of
painting.

For example, it is assumed that a person with a
large body cannot run fast or a person with a slender
body is weak or that one skin colour is more beautiful
than another.

Look at people with various body types around
you — short, tall, thin, fat, dark-skinned, lightskinned, bald, hairy, hunched, etc. Observe your
own body. What thoughts run through your mind?

The images we see in magazines, hoardings, films,
videos and social media influence the way we think
about our bodies. Gather more examples of body
stereotypes. You may find these in advertisements,
story illustrations, videos, films, etc.

A stereotype is a widely accepted idea,
generalising a person, place or community. It is not
factual. Discuss common assumptions that are made
about body types, promoting certain stereotypes.

TEXTILEs AND
traditions

Just like you use a pencil
and paper to create
pictures, artists use cloth,
thread and needle to
create artwork.
Indian textiles are known for a variety of
motifs, each having symbolic meanings of their
own. Motifs are decorative images that usually
repeat and form patterns. They vary from region
to region and are seen in many fabrics worn today.

Dots and circles
Wholeness and
one’s energy

Lines
Movement and
progress

Explore some of the motifs and their meanings
here, before you proceed to other activities in this
chapter. Learn a few basic skills and techniques
to create your own textile artwork.

THREADING STORIES
Dhaaga and Soodi
had an argument
one day. Dhaaga
wanted the curtain
open and Soodi
wanted it shut.
The curtain was
being
pushed
around and it
finally screamed,
“Stop it! Both of you!”
Hearing the curtain
speak, Dhaaga and
Soodi froze!
“Look what you
have done! You have
hurt me and now I
have a tear…”, the
curtain said. Dhaaga
and
Soodi
went
closer and looked at
the damaged curtain.

Thread is called Dhaaga in Hindi.
Needle is called Soodi in Telugu.
What are they called in the
languages you know? Learn what
these are called in other Indian
languages!

DO YOU
KNOW?

The
curtain
continued to speak and
told them the story of
how it was made.
“When your Aaji
passed
away,
your
parents kept
few of
the special clothes she
used to wear. I am
the patchwork they
created using pieces of
fabric from her clothes.
Look at all the
pieces that have been stitched together on my
body. Each of these is from the clothes your Aaji
wore. Here is a piece from the beautiful sweater
she knitted herself. Next to it, is a piece from the
yellow saree that had a big tea stain! Touch the
design on it, your father took that stained portion and

188 | Kriti

created this beautiful embroidery over it. Do
you see the square window at the centre of this
patchwork? It was made by a process called
crochet. This piece was your Aaji's favourite.
Have you noticed the bottom edge of the
patchwork? These are called tassels. You will
see fine threads in it, arranged together and
knotted in beautiful patterns. There are some
loose threads even in my tear …see? You can
clearly see the warp and weft of the weave.
Remember, I am not just a curtain, I am a
patchwork of stories. Each piece in me has its
own story. They are all stitched together with
many threads.
When threads start fighting among
themselves like you both just did, what do you
think will happen?”
Dhaaga and Soodi looked at each other and
smiled, “Shall we repair the tear together?”,
Soodi asked Dhaaga. He agreed and they got
busy. What would you do if you were Dhaaga
or Soodi?

ACTIVITY 18.1: FABRIC JOURNAL
Step 1: Look at the variety of objects in your
home that are made of fibre or fabric.
Step 2: Collect a few samples from discarded
clothes, bags, mats and rags. Visit a local
tailor and ask them if they can spare small
pieces of fabric of different thicknesses
and textures.
Step 3: As you collect textile samples,
remember to note down a few stories about each
fabric. Note where you found it, who it might
have belonged to, what kind of fibre it is made
of and a few lines about the patterns you see.
Step 4: Plan the pages of your journal. Work
in pairs gathering both your textile samples
and stories. Discuss and identify the different
materials you have managed to collect
(cotton/silk/wool/jute, etc.).
You can choose to organise them by material,
colour, texture or pattern. For example, plain
coloured fabrics together, printed fabrics
together, all cotton together, etc. Include
your notes and stories to make your journal
interesting.

by learning the basic stitches.
Process
1. Take a thread that is approximately 50 cm
in length.
2. Thread your needle and keep one of the
ends short.
3. Make a knot at the end of the longer end.
4. Prepare your card sheet/cloth by marking lines and
piercing holes with the needle (See the picture).
5. Start stitching and follow the pattern for each
stitch.
6. At the end of your line or when your thread is
about to finish, make a knot on the reverse side of
your work and cut the thread.

ACTIVITY 18.4: MAKE YOUR TEXTILE ARTWORK
Textile artworks need not be made only on a flat surface.
They can be three-dimensional too. You might have seen
attractive toys that are made of cloth, yarn or fibre. There
are many well-known artists who have been inspired by
textile arts and crafts traditions.
Look at the examples of artwork created by students
like you. What kind of textile artwork would you like
to make? You may find inspiration from your local
textile traditions. It could be weaving, knitting, crochet,
macramé, fabric toys, painting, printing, tie and dye, etc.

the ART OF
CALLIGRAPHY

Scripts have the power to record people’s
languages and expressions.
India’s writing systems can be traced
from the 5000-year old Indus-Sarasvati
civilisation. But the earliest decoded
inscriptions in Brahmi script from the
Ashokan edicts are almost 2300 years
old. The original Constitution of
India was handwritten by two
expert calligraphers. Prem
Behari Narain Raizada
wrote the English version
and Vasant Krishan Vaidya
wrote it in Hindi. It was
signed on 26 January 1950,
the day we observe as
Republic Day. Today, the
Indian constitution officially
recognises 22 languages. Look
at the beautiful forms
and variations in Indian
scripts in the tree on
the left.

You will learn and discover more about calligraphy
in this chapter.
Letters are the smallest unit of any script. An
unknown script looks like a string of small drawings.
The letters we use today were all initially drawings,
which evolved into pictograms and then into
organised systems of writing.

Calligraphy is much more than the art of writing
letters to spell words. Artists pour emotions into
each letter to create a variety of expressions. They
spend a lot of time and effort in writing, inscribing
and carving by hand. Each letter style has a purpose.
In ancient manuscripts, letters were decorative and
flowed with life. Some letters were creatively placed
to look like a frame or picture. Today’s newspapers
use bold and clear letters to draw our attention and
help readers read information quickly.
The materials and tools used in calligraphy include
a variety of quills, brushes, nibs, inks and paints on
surfaces like palm leaf, cloth, paper, and so on.

ACTIVITY 19.1: LOOKING AT LETTERS
Which letters can you find in the Indian
Rupee symbol?
The symbol of the Indian rupee
is derived from the letter र
from the word Rupiah in the
Devanagari script. The top
horizontal line also known
as the Shiro-Rekha of the
Devanagari script, gives it an
Indian identity. Seen along with the second
horizontal line, it represents the three bands
of the tricolour of our Indian flag.
Just by playing around with lines and
shapes of letters, you can enhance an idea.
Observe the ‘Incredible India’ logo. The
exclamation mark in place of the letter ‘I’
makes it more expressive. What kind of letter
play do you observe in the other logos? Discuss
and note your observations.

ACTIVITY 19.2: LETTER HUNT
Before digital technology, printing involved long
processes. Visit a newspaper office or print studio to find
out more about the printing processes.
Let us begin a treasure hunt activity using print
material found in our surroundings.
Step 1: Collect a few newspapers, and printed material
including invitation cards, food packaging material and
old magazines.
Step 2: Discuss and write your thoughts about —
 How are the words or letters arranged?
 Why do you think the letters are printed in different
colours and sizes?
 What do you find attractive in the style of letters or
words?
 Which words on the printed material are most
important? Why?
Step 3: Cut out words and letters of different sizes and
styles.
Step 4: Work in groups to find similar letter styles. For
example, decorative, bold, italic, thin, narrow, etc.
Step 5: Arrange and paste them on an A3-size paper by
grouping similar letter styles.

197 | ART OF CALLIGRAPHY

198 | Kriti

ACTIVITY 19.3: SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT
Observe the table below. It shows different versions of the
same letter.

A a a A a a A

A

A a

Are you able to read the same letter written in so many
ways?
This is similar to human or animal bodies. We have the
same body parts, yet we look unique. Human anatomy is
about the number of bones, muscles, joints, etc. Similarly, the
anatomy of letters reveals the different parts of a letter.

Step 1: Choose a letter from any script you
are familiar with.
Step 2: Take a sheet of paper and write the
letter you have chosen in different ways.
Step 3: Start by writing letters freely. Use
your non-dominant hand, and see the lines
and shapes that are formed. Use different
kinds of pens, pencils and other writing
tools. Make the letters big and small.
Step 4: Take another sheet of paper. To
structure the same letter, mark a baseline,
top line and a middle line.
Step 5: Mark vertical lines to create a grid.
This will help you estimate the width of
each alphabet, as well as the space between
each letter.
Step 6: Create five variations of the same
letter. Use the guidelines to alter the height,
width, angles and line-thickness of the letters
to achieve different styles. Begin writing the
letter, keeping in mind its anatomy.
Step 7: Share your work with your peers.
Discuss how you wrote one letter in different
ways.

ACTIVITY 19.4: WRITING LIKE WE SPEAK
When you speak to people, you modulate
your voice which creates a variation in
the volume. Doing this conveys various
emotions. For example, when you wish your
friend “Happy Birthday!” you say it with
excitement and joy, whereas when you say,
“Get well soon”, you say it calmly and show
concern.
If we relate it to writing, it could be that
a loud voice is written in big, bold letters,
whereas softer voice is written in small
letters.
Now, why don’t you try to shape letters
in a variety of ways to convey the meanings
and emotions of words?
Look at the examples on the right side
and try creating your own in a language or
script that you are comfortable with.
Note to the Teacher
Calligraphy skills are used in a variety of
professions and vocations — tattooing,
graphic art, illustration, animation,
and so on.

After finalising the letter style of the title,
proceed to write other information on the
poster like:

Step 1: Choose a name or title for your play or event.
Step 2: Decide the letter style, size and colours for the title.
The way you style letters can give readers an insight into the
nature of the event. If it is a play, you can convey whether the
play is happy, sad or contains suspense.
Step 3: Mark the guidelines and margins while writing the text.

1. Date, time and venue;
2. Contact information, and
3. Names of people, organisations,
institutions, performing troupes, etc.
For these, your letter styles should be clear
and easily readable. Choose suitable sizes to
indicate their importance and use guidelines
while writing.
Add visuals and complete your poster for display.

Integration of all Art Forms

— Sculptures come Alive!

Art is a powerful language
that speaks to your mind
and heart. What you feel
and experience during a
concert or while viewing a
painting is something that
cannot be put in words.
Now, imagine all these art
forms that you have learnt,
coming together to give one
unique experience! You
are about to try doing that
here!

ACTIVITY 20.1: STORIES IN STONE
The objective of this activity is to
inspire creativity and collaboration
by using ancient sculptures as a
starting point to build a story, and
then bringing it to life through
performance with music, movement
and dialogue.
1. Preparation
 Look at all the pictures of
sculptures and stone carving
in the book. It is there in all
the four sections. You can also
find more pictures from the
ones found around you or
Carved wall inside the 7th century temples in Pattadakal,
UNESCO World Heritage Site

from the places to where you have travelled
(these could include depictions of gods,
dancers, warriors, animals or everyday life
scenes).
 You can also discuss with your social
science teacher to provide more pictures of
sculptures that could be used in the story.
2. Story Creation
 Make small groups (4 – 6 students).
 Each group carefully examines the
sculptures, and imagine the lives, emotions
and actions of the figures depicted.

 With help from your teacher, create a story
that connects the sculptures in a meaningful
way. For example:
 A heroic adventure of a warrior statue.
 A festival scene featuring dancers and
musicians.
 A divine story featuring gods and
mythical creatures.
 A simple tale from the life of common
people.
 Arrange the pictures in the order of how the
story progresses, so it makes sense when you

Incorporating Art Forms
 Visual art — Imagine the parts of the story
which don’t have pictures and make your own
drawings to connect and express the story.
Recall the familiar visual storytelling traditions
that you have learnt about in this book like
Phad or Patachitra. Take inspiration from these
and create your own visual narrative. Think
about the variety of materials and techniques

Kanyakumari

Temple, Chhattisgarh

you can use to express your story.
 Movement — Include
dance
or
body
movements and gestures to represent the
hastas and postures of the sculptures.
 Dialogue — Write
short
dialogues
or
monologues for the characters inspired by
the expressions or postures in the sculptures.
This should help in taking the story forward.
 Music/Songs — Add traditional music or
create simple songs that fit the story. You can
clap, hum or use available instruments to
create rhythm.

Gangaikondacholisvaram Temple,
Gangaikonda Cholapuram

Brihadeeswarar Temple, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu

 Folk storytelling — Try incorporating one
of the styles of storytelling that you have
studied in this book, like Phad storytelling or
Harikathe or any other local form that you
have seen.
4. Rehearsal and Practice
 Each group is given time to rehearse their
story, incorporating movement, music and
dialogue.
 You can be creative by adding interesting
parts to the story, but remember to keep the
story clear and focused.

5. Presentation and reflection
 Each group performs their story for the
class. The audience (the rest of the class that
is watching) can discuss how the sculptures
inspired the characters, movements and
actions.
 After the
discussion:

Outcome
This activity helps students connect with
India’s rich heritage of temple art while
encouraging teamwork, storytelling and
creativity. By integrating music, movement
and dialogue, they learn to bring history to
life in an engaging and imaginative way.

Note to the Teacher: Though this is
presented here as an activity to be in the
classroom, the story performances can
be presented in front of the school
audience or in the assembly to
motivate the children.
