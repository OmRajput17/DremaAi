FOREWORD
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages a system of
education in the country that is rooted in an Indian ethos and its
civilisational accomplishments in all fields of knowledge and human
endeavour. At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage
constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the twenty-first
century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid
out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education
(NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing
students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence
(pañchakośhas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the
Stage for further learning at the Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to
8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the
Preparatory and Secondary Stages.
The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with
the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It aims
to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities,
and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await
them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from
three languages—including at least two languages native to India—
to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical
Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their
holistic development.
Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential
conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different
curricular areas, as these textbooks are intended to play a central role
in mediating between content and pedagogy’s role that helps strike
a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities
for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom
arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish
conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT),
on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality
textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups (CAGs), which have been
constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts,
pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all
possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Ganita Prakash, the textbook
of mathematics for Grade 8 (Part 1) is designed to make learning fun,
engaging, and meaningful. Aligned with NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, the
textbook continues to foster the spirit of experiential and inquiry-based
learning, a spirit already introduced in the mathematics textbooks for
Grades 6 and 7. It encourages students to ask questions, think critically,
and understand concepts of mathematics through real-world contexts.

The textbook makes efforts to encourage the students to observe and
explore patterns around them and discover mathematical concepts on
their own. The content is structured in a way that supports a joyful
and progressive understanding of increasingly complex concepts,
easing students into more advanced learning. The content attempts to
integrate mathematics with other subject areas, such as Science, Social
Science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value
education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS).
At most of the places the concept begins with either a story or a puzzle
that not only makes students think but also feels the importance of the
concept.
However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should
also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School
libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides,
the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and
encouraging students to do so.
With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been
involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will
meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite
suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in
the coming years.

ABOUT THE BOOK
Mathematics helps students develop not only basic arithmetic
skills, but also the crucial capacities of logical reasoning, creative
problem-solving, and clear and precise communication (both oral
and written). Mathematical knowledge also plays a crucial role in
understanding concepts in other school subjects, such as Science and
Social Science, and even Arts, Physical Education, and Vocational
Education. Learning Mathematics contributes to the development of
capacities to make informed choices and decisions. Understanding
numbers and quantitative arguments is necessary for effective and
meaningful democratic and economic participation. Mathematics
thus plays an important role in achieving the overall aims of school
education.
Mathematics at the Middle Stage is a major challenge and performs
the dual role of being both close to the experience and environment of a
learner and being abstract. It performs the role of developing intuition,
while also maintaining and emphasising rigour. It is enhancing critical
and logical thinking, while also developing artistry and creativity, and
a sense of elegance and aesthetics. Mathematics provides students with
plenty of opportunities to explore and discover concepts on their own
while also teaching the best-known methods in the global repertoire of
mathematics.
This textbook attempts to address the goals and challenges of
learning mathematics. The writers have aimed to strike a judicious
balance between informal and formal definitions and methods in
helping students to develop both intuition and rigour. The textbook
also provides numerous opportunities for student-student and
student–teacher interaction in the classroom to promote active and
experiential learning. A number of questions, puzzles, and interactive
exercises are posed throughout the textbook to encourage constant
exploration. Many of the questions are open-ended to stimulate
classroom discussion.
The Chapter 1: ‘A Square and A Cube’ is an introduction to the
special types of numbers called squares and cubes through engaging
explorations, and contexts. Chapter 2: ‘Power Play’ considers short
and logical ways of expressing very large numbers, and discusses how
they can be written and read without ambiguity. Chapter 3: ‘A Story of
Numbers’ reveals how the idea of number and number representation
evolved over the course of time, across different places in the world,
to finally reach its modern efÏcient form. Chapter 4: ‘Quadrilaterals’
discusses some interesting types of four-sided figures and problems
based on them. Chapter 5: ‘Number Play’ shows different properties of
numbers studied by the students with a balance of engaging activities

through visualisation and rigorous mathematical reasoning. Chapter 6:
‘We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply’ covers aspects related to Algebra,
and in particular, the distributive law. Chapter 7: ‘Proportional
Reasoning’ explores a new way to compare two quantities using
daily life situations. In all the chapters, an attempt has been made to
emphasise connections with other subjects including Art, History and
Science.
By weaving storytelling and hands-on activities together, as done in
Grades 6 and 7, we hope that an immersive learning experience will
be created that ignites curiosity and fosters a love for mathematics. It
is hoped that teachers would give students the opportunity to discuss,
play, engage with each other and provide logical arguments for different
ideas, and find loopholes in arguments presented. This is necessary
for the learners to eventually develop the ability to understand what
it means to prove something and also become confident about the
underlying concepts. The mathematics classroom should not expect a
blind application of algorithms but should rather encourage students
to find many different ways to solve problems.
As per the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, computational
thinking has also been gently introduced through puzzles, games,
and interactive exercises that encourage students on these aspects.
Indian rootedness has also been kept in mind while giving contexts
for different concepts. The contributions of Indian mathematicians
have also been given as part of a problem-solving approach to make
students aware of India’s rich mathematical heritage and its global
contributions to mathematics.
The concepts and problems in this textbook are related to daily life
situations. An attempt has been made to use contexts and materials
that students are familiar with. Learning material sheets have been
given at the back of the book that may be photocopied and used in
the classroom. Exercises or activities are often given to encourage
peer group efforts and discussions. However, this textbook intends
to address the learning needs of a diverse group of students in the
classroom.
We have tried to link concepts learnt in initial chapters with
ideas in subsequent chapters, to show the connectedness and unity
of mathematics. We hope that teachers can revise these concepts in
a spiralling way so that students are able to appreciate the entire
conceptual structure of mathematics. We hope that teachers may
focus more on the ideas of squares and cubes, exponents, evolution
of numbers and other notions that are new to the students, and are
foundational for further learning.
Finally, this textbook aims to be more than just a textbook — it is
a passport to a world of mathematical discovery and exploration.
Whether used in the classroom or at home, we hope that it inspires
vi

students to embark on their own mathematical adventures, empowering
them to see the beauty and relevance of Mathematics in everything.
With its engaging approach and comprehensive coverage of Grade 8
mathematics concepts, this textbook aims to captivate young minds
and set them on a lifelong journey of mathematical discovery.
I once again thank all the writers of and contributors of this textbook
for their valuable contribution and service to the nation’s mathematics
teachers, learners and enthusiasts.
We look forward to your comments and suggestions regarding the
textbook and hope that you will send interesting exercises, activities
and tasks that you may develop while teaching and learning for future
editions.

NOTE TO THE TEACHER
We hope that this book, Ganita Prakash, will serve as a strong support
and guide to you in achieving the exciting task that you have before
you: that of passing on the joy of learning the beautiful subject of
Mathematics to the next generation.
This task calls for providing a fertile environment that allows for
the flowering of mathematical thinking in the minds of students.
Classrooms,where students just listen and write down whatever is being
told to them or written on the board, are deficient in the conditions
required for learning mathematics. Instead, classrooms need to be places
where students are engaged in playing with mathematical concepts,
finding and discussing patterns, and developing creative strategies
together to solve problems. Students should also be posing problems
to each other and discussing possible solutions with each other. In fact,
these are the very conditions that have led to the development of the
entire field of mathematics so far, and so one cannot expect students
to pick up mathematical thinking and understanding without these
conditions.
Fortunately, it is not difÏcult to create such conditions in the
classroom. It just requires an interesting question, problem, pattern,
or challenge to be thrown open to the students on a regular basis, and
sufÏcient time to be given to them to play with, discuss, and work on it
as a class or in pairs or groups.
Along with it, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges
their importance in learning needs to be nurtured.
While creating the spark for initiating mathematical thinking in
classrooms is not difÏcult, sustaining it may be challenging and may
involve efforts from your side. Nevertheless, even if just the first part
of throwing open a question, problem, pattern, or challenge is done at
least once or twice a week, accompanied by sufÏcient waiting time from
your side for students to play, discuss, and work on it, it can have a great
positive impact on how the students view and approach mathematics.
It should be noted that this positive impact will not happen overnight.
That takes time and depends on various factors such as the number
of opportunities you give for problem solving, your patience, and the
encouragement you give to the students.
To support you in posing problems, all the problems or questions
and
. These icons
in this book are marked using the icons
are indicators of potential opportunities to start off a process of
problem-solving and exploration in the classroom. You will find some
Math
of the problems labelled ‘ Talk

’. Such questions can especially be

made as topics for classroom discussion.

An owl mascot appears at various points in the textbook to highlight
important mathematical processes, ways of thinking, and problemsolving approaches. These can be brought out during classroom
discussions, both where the owl is present and also in other similar
situations.
In this grade, justification/proofs of mathematical statements find
an increased presence. Students should be gently encouraged to
deduce properties and not be forced to do it. Whenever students face
challenges in doing it, encourage them to experiment and observe, and
use their intuition in figuring out properties. Providing justification/
proof is a skill that takes time to develop.
To develop students’ mathematical thinking and understanding of
concepts, a sufÏcient number of problems are given. Trying to ‘cover’
all of them must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend
quality time on playing with and discussing them.
It is important to understand that the exploratory problems are
not only for promoting problem solving skills; they also serve in
strengthening procedural fluency when children start engaging in
exploration.
Efforts must be made in making students independent learners. One
essential aspect required for this is an ability to read and understand
mathematical text. To promote this skill, students should be encouraged
to read the book by themselves and in groups. Give opportunities to
them to interpret what they read and express it to others. This will also
address the big problem that students face in speaking mathematics
and interpreting word problems.
This textbook contains a number of open-ended problems. It also
contains new treatments of certain concepts. If you are not able to
solve them or follow some of them immediately, it is perfectly okay!
Not everyone knows everything. Along with trying to understand and
reflect upon such content,it will be very useful to take it to the classroom
and open it up for discussion. After the discussion, things that are clear
and those that are not yet clear can be clearly summarised. This process
itself can throw a lot of light on the content.
In these discussions, you can participate as a fellow seeker, and
when students see a teacher seek and think to understand something,
it sets a wonderful example for them.
It is hoped that you and your students will have a great and fruitful
time using this textbook!

Summary of Key Points
Time for Exploration
1. It is important to routinely pose new problems, questions, patterns,
or challenges to the students and give them sufÏcient time to play
with, discuss, and work on them, individually and in groups.
2. During this time, an environment that accepts mistakes and
acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured.
3. There should be a culture where students pose problems to each
other and discuss with each other various ways to approach the
problems.
About the Problems in the Book
1. The exploratory problems in the book not only promote
problem solving; they also aim to strengthen procedural fluency
when students start engaging in exploration.
2. Trying to ‘cover’ all the problems in the book must not happen at
the cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing
with, discussing, and solving them.
Reading
1. Encourage students to read the book by themselves and
in groups.
2. Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and to
express it to others.
Right of Not Knowing!
1. It is perfectly okay if some of the content is not understood
immediately. Along with trying to understand and reflect upon
such content, it can also be taken to the classroom and opened
up for discussion. After the discussion, things that are clear and
those that are not yet clear can be clearly summarised. In these
discussions, you can participate as a fellow seeker, and when
students see a teacher seek and think to understand something, it
sets a wonderful example for them!
2. Learning is a continual process. Indeed, there is so much in
mathematics that is still not known and requires further exploration!

A NOTE TO STUDENTS!
To be able to appreciate the art of mathematics, it is not enough to just
be a passive spectator. You need to immerse yourself in its process like
a detective getting into action to solve a mystery.
This is especially required when you see a new question or when
a question arises from your own sense of wonder, or when you come
across a new beautiful pattern. When you encounter these, pause your
reading, and use your creativity to work out the question or understand
and appreciate the pattern.
You will find that some questions are accompanied by their answers.
Even if this is the case, it is worthwhile to work on the problems by
yourself or in a group before you see the answer.
This will enrich your experience of going through the book!
Whenever there are questions coming up, you will see the icon

A SQUARE AND A CUBE

Queen Ratnamanjuri had a will written that described her fortune of
ratnas (precious stones) and also included a puzzle. Her son Khoisnam
and their 99 relatives were invited to the reading of her will. She wanted
to leave all of her ratnas to her son, but she knew that if she did so, all
their relatives would pester Khoisnam forever. She hoped that she had
taught him everything he needed to know about solving puzzles. She left
the following note in her will—
“I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it at the same time, you
will share the ratnas equally. However, if you are the first one to solve the
problem, you will get to keep the entire inheritance to yourself. Good luck.”
The minister took Khoisnam and his 99 relatives to a secret room in
the mansion containing 100 lockers.
The minister explained— “Each person is assigned a number from 1 to
100.
•

Person 1 opens every locker.

•

Person 2 toggles every 2nd locker (i.e., closes it if it is open, opens
it if it is closed).

•

Person 3 toggles every 3rd locker (3rd, 6th, 9th, … and so on).

•

Person 4 toggles every 4th locker (4th, 8th, 12th, … and so on).

This continues until all 100 get their turn.
In the end, only some lockers remain open. The open lockers reveal
the code to the fortune in the safe.”
Before the process begins, Khoisnam realises that he
already knows which lockers will be open at the end.
How did he figure out the answer?
Hint: Find out how many times each locker is toggled.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

If a locker is toggled an odd number of times, it will be open. Otherwise,
it will be closed. The number of times a locker is toggled is the same as
the number of factors of the locker number. For example, for locker #6,
Person 1 opens it, Person 2 closes it, Person 3 opens it and Person 6 closes
it. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 are factors of 6. If
6:
the number of factors is even, the locker will be
1×6
toggled by an even number of people and it will
2×3
eventually be closed.
Factors are
Note that each factor of a number has a
1, 2, 3 and 6.
‛partner factor’ so that the product of the pair
of factors yields the given number. Here, 1 and
6 form a pair of partner factors of 6, and 2 and 3
form another pair.
Does every number have an even number of factors?

1:
1×1
The only factor
is 1.

4:
1×4
2×2
Factors are
1, 2 and 4.

9:
1×9
3×3
Factors are
1, 3 and 9.

We see in some cases, like 2 × 2, that the numbers in the pair are the
same.
Can you use this insight to find more numbers with an odd number of
factors?
For instance, 36 has a factor pair 6 × 6 where both numbers are 6.
Does this number have an odd number of factors? If every factor of 36
other than 6 has a different factor as its partner, then we can be sure
that 36 has an odd number of factors. Check if this is true.
Hence all the following numbers have an odd number of factors —
1 × 1, 2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4, ...
A number that can be expressed as the product of a number with
itself is called a square number, or simply a square. The only numbers
that have an odd number of factors are the squares, because they each
have one factor which, when multiplied by itself, equals the number.
Therefore, every locker whose number is a square will remain open.

2

A Square and A Cube

Write the locker numbers that remain open.
Khoisnam immediately collects word clues from these 10 lockers and
reads, “The passcode consists of the first five locker numbers that
were touched exactly twice.”
Which are these five lockers?
The lockers that are toggled twice are the prime numbers, since each
prime number has 1 and the number itself as factors. So, the code is
2-3-5-7-11.

1.1 Square Numbers
Why are the numbers, 1, 4, 9, 16, …, called squares? We know that the
number of unit squares in a square (the area of a square) is the product
of its sides. The table below gives the areas of squares with different
sides.
Sidelength

Area

(in units)

(in sq units)

1

1 × 1 = 1 sq. unit

2

2 × 2 = 4 sq. units

3

3 × 3 = 9 sq. units

4

4 × 4 = 16 sq. units

5

5 × 5 = 25 sq. units

10

10 × 10 = 100 sq. units

We use the following notation for squares.
1 × 1 = 12 = 1
2 × 2 = 22 = 4
3 × 3 = 32 = 9,
4 × 4 = 42 = 16
5 × 5 =. 52 = 25.
..
In general, for any number n, we write n × n = n2, which is read as ‛n squared’.
Can we have a square of sidelength 35 or 2.5 units?
9
Yes, there area in square units are ( 35 ) = ( 35 ) × ( 35 ) = (25
),
2

2

and (2.5) = (2.5) × (2.5) = 6.25.

The squares of natural numbers are called perfect squares. For
example, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, … are all perfect squares.

Study the squares in the table above. What are the digits in the
units places of these numbers? All these numbers end with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or

If a number ends in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9, is it always a square?
Talk
The numbers 16 and 36 are both squares with 6 in the units place.
However, 26, whose units digit is also 6, is not a square. Therefore, we
cannot determine if a number is a square just by looking at the digit in
the units place. But, the units digit can tell us when a number is not a
square. If a number ends with 2, 3, 7, or 8, then we can definitely say that
it is not a square.
Write 5 numbers such that you can determine by looking at their units
digit that they are not squares.
The squares, 12, 92, 112, 192, 212, and 292, all have 1 in their units place.
Write the next two squares. Notice that if a number has 1 or 9 in the
units place, then its square ends in 1.
Let us consider square numbers ending in 6: 16 = 42, 36 = 62, 196 = 142,
256 = 162, 576 = 242, and 676 = 262.

Perfect Squares and Odd Numbers
Let us explore the differences between consecutive squares. What do
you notice?
4–1=3

9–4=5

16 – 9 = 7

25 – 16 = 9

See if this pattern continues for the next few square numbers.
From this we observe that adding consecutive odd numbers starting
from 1 gives consecutive square numbers, as shown below.
1=1
1+3=4
1+3+5=9
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36.

Do you remember this pattern from Grade 6?
The picture below explains why each subsequent inverted L gives the
next odd number:

1+3

1 + 3 + (3 + 2)

1+3+5

1 + 3 + 5 + (5 + 2)

1+3+5+7

We see that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n2. Alternatively,
every square is a sum of successive odd numbers starting from 1.
In mathematics, sometimes arguments and reasoning can be
presented without any words. Visual proofs can be complete by
themselves.
Also, we can find out whether a number is a perfect square by
successively subtracting odd numbers. Consider the number 25,
successively subtract 1, 3, 5, ... until you get or cross over 0,
25 – 1 = 24

24 – 3 = 21

21 – 5 = 16

16 – 7 = 9

9–9=0

This means 25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 and is thus a perfect square. Since we
subtracted the first five odd numbers, 25 = 52.
Using the pattern above, find 362, given that 352 = 1225.
From the question we know that 1225 is the sum of the first 35 odd
numbers. To find 362, we need to add the 36th odd number to 1225.
How do we find the 36th odd number?
The 1st odd number is 1, 2nd odd number is 3, 3rd number is 5, …, 6th
odd number is 11 and so on.
What is the nth odd number?
The nth odd number is 2n–1.
Therefore, the 36th odd number is 71.
By adding 71 to 1225, we get 1296, which is 362.
Consider a number such as 38 that is not a square and subtract
consecutive odd numbers starting from 1.
38 – 1 = 37

37 – 3 = 34

13 – 11 = 2

2 – 13 = – 11

34 – 5 = 29

29 – 7 = 22

22 – 9 = 13

This shows that 38 cannot be expressed as a sum of consecutive odd
numbers starting with 1.

Thus, we can say that a natural number is not a perfect square if it
cannot be expressed as a sum of successive odd natural numbers starting
from 1. We can use this result to find out whether a natural number is a
perfect square.

Square Roots
The area of a square is 49 sq. cm. What is the length of its side?
We know that 7 × 7 = 49, or 72 = 49.

7

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

So, the length of the side of a square with an area of 49 sq. cm is 7 cm.
We call 7 the square root of 49.
In general, if y= x2 then x is the square root of y.
What is the square root of 64?
We know that 8 × 8 is 64. So, 8 is the square root of 64. What about
– 8 × – 8 ? That is 64 too!
82 = 64, and (– 8)2 = 64.
So, the square roots of 64 are + 8 and – 8.
Every perfect square has two integer square roots. One is positive and
the other is negative. The square root of a number is denoted by
Thus, 64 =± 8 and 100 =± 10 .

Given a number, such as 576 or 327, how do we find out if it is a
perfect square? If it is a perfect square, how can we find its square
root?

Math
Talk

We know that perfect squares end in 1, 4, 9, 6, 5, or an even
number of zeros. But, it is not certain that a number that satisfies this
condition is a square.
We can clearly say that 327 is not a perfect square. However, we
cannot be sure that 576 is a perfect square.
1. We can list all the square numbers in sequence and find out
whether 576 occurs among them. We know that 202 = 400, we can
find squares of 21, 22, 23, … and so on until we get 576 or a number
greater than 576.
202 = 400

212 = 441

222 = 484

232 = 529

242 = 576

However, this process becomes inefÏcient for larger numbers.
2. Recall that every square can be expressed as a sum of consecutive
odd numbers starting from 1.
Consider

81 .

81 – 1 = 80
56 – 11 = 45

80 – 3 = 77

77 – 5 = 72

45 – 13 = 32

72 – 7 = 65

32 – 15 = 17

65 – 9 = 56

17 – 17 = 0

From 81, we successively subtracted consecutive odd numbers
starting from 1 until we obtained 0 at the 9th step. Therefore 81 = 9.
Can we find the square root of 729 using this method? Yes, but it
will be time-consuming.

8

A Square and A Cube

3. We know that a perfect square is obtained by multiplying an integer
by itself. Will looking at a number’s prime factorisation help in
determining whether it is a perfect square?
Yes, if we can divide the prime factors of a number into two
equal groups, then the product of the prime factors in either group
combine to form the square root.
Is 324 a perfect square?
324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3.
These can be grouped as
324 = (2 × 3 × 3) × (2 × 3 × 3).
= (2 × 3 × 3)2 = 182.
We can also write the prime factors in pairs. That is,
324 = (2 × 2) × (3 × 3) × (3 × 3),
which shows that 324 is a perfect square. Thus,
324 = (2×3×3)2 = 182.
Therefore, 324 =18.
Is 156 a perfect square?
The prime factorisation of 156 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 13.
We cannot pair up these factors.
Therefore, 156 is not a perfect square.
Find whether 1156 and 2800 are perfect squares using prime factorisation.
We can estimate the square root of larger perfect squares by looking
at the closest perfect squares we are familiar with and then narrowing
down the interval to search.
For example, to find 1936 , we can reason as follows:
(i)

1936 is between 1600 (402) and 2500 (502), so 40 < 1936 < 50.

(ii)

The last digit of 1936 is 6. So, the last digit of the square root
must either be 4 or 6. It can be 44 or 46.

(iii)

If we calculate 452, we can compare it with 1936 to halve
the interval to search from 40–50 to either 40–45 or 45–50.
We can write 452 as (40 + 5) (40 + 5) = 402 + 2 × 40 × 5 + 52
= 1600 + 400 + 25 = 2025.

(iv) 2025 > 1936. So, 40 < 1936 < 45
(v)

From the observation in point b we can guess and then verify
that 1936 is 44.

Consider the following situations —
Aribam and Bijou play a game. One says a number and the other
replies with its square root. Aribam starts. He says 25, and Bijou quickly

9

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

responds with 5. Then Bijou says 81, and Aribam answers 9. The game
goes on till Aribam says 250. Bijou is not able to answer because 250
is not a perfect square. Aribam asks Bijou if he can at least provide a
number that is close to the square root of 250.
For this, Bijou needs to estimate the square root of 250.
We know that 100 < 250 < 400 and 100 = 10 and 400 = 20.
So, 10 < 250 < 20.
But, we are still not very close to the number whose square is 250.
We know that 152 = 225 and 162 = 256.
Therefore, 15 < 250 < 16. Since 256 is much closer to 250 than 225,
250 is approximately 16. We also know it is less than 16.
Here is another problem that requires estimating square roots.
Akhil has a square piece of cloth of area 125 cm2. He wants to know
if he can cut out a square handkerchief of side 15 cm. If not, he wants
to know the maximum size handkerchief that can be cut out from this
piece of cloth with an integer side length.
125 is not a perfect square. The nearest perfect squares are 112 = 121
and 122 = 144. So the largest square handkerchief with integer side length
that can be cut out from this piece of cloth has side length 11 cm.

Consider the numbers 1, 8, 27, ...
These numbers are called perfect cubes. Can you see why they are
named so?
Each of them is obtained by multiplying a number by itself three
times. We note that
1=1×1×1
8=2×2×2
27 = 3 × 3 × 3
Is 9 a cube?
We see that 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 and 3 × 3 × 3 = 27. This shows that
9 is not a perfect cube. Nor is any number from 10 to 26.
Can you estimate the number of unit cubes in a cube with an
edge length of 4 units?
It has 64 unit cubes! If you notice carefully, each layer
of this cube has 4 × 4 unit cubes. Each square layer has
16 unit cubes (4 × 4), and there are 4 such layers, so the
total number of unit cubes is 4 × 4 × 4 = 64.
Since 53 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125, 125 is a cube.
In general, for any number n, we write the cube

Taxicab Numbers
Once when Srinivasa Ramanujan was working with
G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, Hardy had
come to visit Ramanujan at a hospital when he was
ill. Hardy had ridden in a taxicab numbered 1729 and
he remarked that 1729 was ‘rather a dull number,’
adding that he hoped that this was not a bad sign.
Ramanujan immediately replied, “No, Hardy, it is a
very interesting number. It is the smallest number
that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two
different ways”.
1729 = 13 + 123
= 93 + 103.
Because of this story, 1729 has since been known as the Hardy–
Ramanujan Number. And numbers that can be expressed as the sum of
two cubes in two different ways are called taxicab numbers.
The next two taxicab numbers after 1729 are 4104 and 13832. Find
the two ways in which each of these can be expressed as the sum of
two positive cubes.

How did Ramanujan know this? Well, he loved numbers. All through his
life, he tinkered with numbers. During Ramanujan’s time in Cambridge,
his colleagues often marveled at his ability to see deep patterns in numbers
that seemed arbitrary to others. His colleague, John Littlewood, once said,
“Every positive integer was one of his [Ramanujan's] personal friends”.

Perfect Cubes and Consecutive Odd Numbers
Consecutive odd numbers have a role to play with cubes too. Look at the
following pattern:
1 = 1 = 13
3 + 5 = 8 = 23
7 + 9 + 11 = 27 = 33
13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 64 = 43
21 + 23 + 25 + 27 + 29 = 125 = 53
31 + 33 + 35 + 37 + 39 + 41 = 216 = 63.
Later in this series, we get the following set of consecutive numbers:
91 + 93 + 95 + 97 + 99 + 101 + 103 + 105 + 107 + 109.
Can you tell what this sum is without doing the calculation?

Cube Roots
We know that 8 = 23.
We call 2 the cube root of 8 and denote this by 2 = 3 8 .
More generally, if y = x3, then x is the cube root of y. This is denoted by
3 3
x = 3 y . So, 3 8 = 2 = 2.
Similarly, 3 27 = 3 33 = 3 and 3 1000 = 3 103 =3. In general, 3 n3 = n .
How do we find out if a number is a cube? Taking inspiration from the
case of squares, let us see if we can use prime factorisations.
Let us check if 3375 is a perfect cube.
3375 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5.
Can the factors be split into three identical groups? For 3375, we can
form three groups of (3 × 5). So,
3375 = (3 × 5) × (3 × 5) × (3 × 5)
= (3 × 5)3 = 153.
Another way is to check if the factors can be grouped into triplet(s):
3375 = (3 × 3 × 3) × (5 × 5 × 5) = 33 × 53.
This means 3 3375 =15 .
Is 500 a perfect cube?
500 = 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5. We see that the factors cannot be split into three
identical groups. Therefore, 500 is not a perfect cube.

1.3 A Pinch of History
The first known list of perfect squares and perfect
cubes was compiled by the Babylonians as far
back as 1700 BCE. These lists, found on clay tablets,
were used to quickly find square roots and cube

15

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

roots in problems involving land measurement, architectural design,
and other areas where geometric calculations were necessary.
In ancient Sanskrit works the term varga was used both for the square
figure or its area, as well as the square power, and the term ghana was
used both for the solid cube as well as the product of a number with
itself three times. The fourth power was called varga-varga . These terms
were used in India at least from the third century BCE.
Aryabhata (499 CE) states
“A square figure of four equal sides and the number representing its area
are called varga. The product of two equal quantities is also called varga.”
Thus, the term varga for square power has its origin in the graphical
representation of a square figure.
Why is the word ‘root’ (the root of a plant) used for the mathematical
operation √ (square root, cube root, etc.)?
It is because, in ancient India, the Sanskrit word mula, meaning
root of a plant, basis, cause, origin, etc., was used for the mathematical
operations of taking roots.
In Sanskrit, varga-mula (the basis, cause, origin of the square) was
used for square-root and ghana-mula was used for cube-root. This use of
mula for the mathematical concept of root was subsequently emulated
in Arabic and Latin through their corresponding words for the root of
a plant — jidhr and radix respectively. The term mula for root has been
used in India at least from the first century BCE. Another term used was
pada (foot, basis, cause, origin). Brahmagupta (628 CE) explains, ‘The
pada (root) of a krti (square) is that of which it is a square.’

3 + 6 = 9, 6 + 10 = 16, 10 + 15 = 25, 15 + 1 = 16.
Try arranging the numbers 1 to 17 (without repetition) in a row in a
similar way — the sum of every adjacent pair of numbers should be a
square.
Can you arrange them in more than one way? If not, can you explain
why?

Can you do the same with numbers from 1 to 32 (again, without
repetition), but this time arranging all the numbers in a circle?

2.1 Experiencing the Power Play ...
An Impossible Venture!
Take a sheet of paper, as large a sheet as you can find. Fold it once. Fold
it again, and again.
How many times can you fold it over and over?
Estu says “I heard that a sheet of paper can’t be folded more than
7 times”.
Roxie replies “What if we use a thinner paper, like a newspaper or a
tissue paper?”
Try it with different types of paper and see what happens.

If you can fold a paper
46 times, it will be so
thick that it can reach
the Moon!

What! That’s crazy!
Just 46 times!? You
must have ignored
several zeros
after 46.

Well, why
don’t you find
out yourselves.

Say you can fold a sheet of paper as many times as you wish. What would
its thickness be after 30 folds? Make a guess.
Let us find out how thick a sheet of paper will be after 46 folds. Assume
that the thickness of the sheet is 0.001 cm.

It might be hard to digest the fact that after just 46 folds, the thickness
is more than 7,00,000 km. This is the power of multiplicative growth,
also called exponential growth. Let us analyse the growth.

2.2 Exponential Notation and Operations
The initial thickness of the paper was 0.001 cm.
Upon folding once, its thickness became 0.001 cm × 2 = 0.002 cm.
Folding it twice, its thickness became —
0.001 cm × 2 × 2 = 0.004 cm, or 0.001 cm × 22 = 0.004 cm (in shorthand).
Upon folding it thrice, its thickness became —
0.001 cm × 2 × 2 × 2, or 0.001 cm × 23 = 0.008 cm.
When folded four times, its thickness became —
0.001 cm × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2, or 0.001 cm × 24 = 0.016 cm.
Similarly, the expression for the thickness of the paper when folded 7
times will be 0.001 cm × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2, or 0.001 cm × 27 = 0.128 cm.
We have seen that square numbers can be expressed as n2 and cube
numbers as n3.
n × n = n2 (read as ‘n squared’ or ‘n raised to the power 2’)

21

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

n × n × n = n3 (read as ‘n cubed’ or ‘n raised to the power 3’)
n × n × n × n = n4 (read as ‘n raised to the power 4’ or ‘the 4th power of n’)
n × n × n × n × n × n × n = n7 (read as ‘n raised to the power 7’ or ‘the 7th
power of n’) and so on.
In general, we write na to denote n multiplied by itself a times.
54 = 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 625.
54 is the exponential form of 625. Here, 4 is the
4
exponent/power, and 5 is the base. Exponents of 5 is read as
the form 5n are called powers of 5: 51, 52, 53, 54, etc. ‘5 raised to the power 4’ or
‘5 to the power 4’ or
2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 210 = 1024.
‘5 power 4’ or
Remember the 1024 from earlier? There, it meant ‘4th power of 5’
that after every 10 folds, the thickness increased
1024 times.
Which expression describes the thickness of a sheet of paper after
it is folded 10 times? The initial thickness is represented by the
letter-number v.
(i) 10v
(iv) 210

(ii) 10 + v
(v) 210v

(iii) 2 × 10 × v

Some more examples of exponential notation:
4 × 4 × 4 = 43 = 64.
(– 4) × (– 4) × (– 4) = (– 4)3= – 64.
Similarly,
a × a × a × b × b can be expressed as a3b2 (read as a cubed b squared).
a × a × b × b × b × b can be expressed as a2b4 (read as a squared b raised
to the power 4).
Remember that 4 + 4 + 4 = 3 × 4 = 12, whereas 4 × 4 × 4 = 43 = 64.

9 × 3 = 27.
27 × 3 = 81.
81 × 3 = 243.
How many diamonds were there in total? Can we find out by just one
multiplication using the products above?
The number of diamonds is 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 37.

We can write

37 = (3 × 3 × 3 × 3) × (3 × 3 × 3)

We had computed till 34. To find 37, we can just multiply 34 (= 81) with
33 (= 27).
3×3×3×3×3×3×3

= 81 × 27 = 2187

Magical Pond
In the middle of a beautiful, magical pond
lies a bright pink lotus. The number of
lotuses doubles every day in this pond.
After 30 days, the pond is completely
covered with lotuses. On which day was
the pond half full?
If the pond is completely covered by
lotuses on the 30th day, how much of it is
covered by lotuses on the 29th day?
Since the number of lotuses doubles every day, the pond should be
half covered on the 29th day.
Write the number of lotuses (in exponential form) when the pond was —
(i) fully covered

(ii) half covered

There is another pond in which the number of lotuses triples every day.
When both the ponds had no flowers, Damayanti placed a lotus in the
doubling pond. After 4 days, she took all the lotuses from there and put
them in the tripling pond. How many lotuses will be in the tripling pond
after 4 more days?
After the first 4 days, the number of lotuses is 1 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 24.
After the next 4 days, the number of lotuses is 24 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 24 × 34.
What if Damayanti had changed the order in which she placed the
flowers in the lakes? How many lotuses would be there?
1 × 34 × 24 = (3 × 3 × 3 × 3) × (2 × 2 × 2 × 2).

How Many Combinations
Estu has 4 dresses and 3 caps. How many different ways can Estu combine
the dresses and caps?
For each cap, he can choose any of the 4 dresses, so for 3 caps, 4 + 4 +
4 = 4 × 3 = 12 combinations are possible. We can also look at it as — for
each dress, Estu can choose any of the 3 caps, so for 4 outfits, 3 + 3 + 3 +
3 = 3 × 4 = 12 combinations are possible.

Roxie has 7 dresses, 2 hats, and 3 pairs of shoes. How many different
ways can Roxie dress up?
Hint: Try drawing a diagram like the one above.
Estu and Roxie came across a safe containing old stamps and coins
that their great-grandfather had collected. It was secured with a
5-digit password. Since nobody knew the password, they had no
option except to try every password until it opened. They were
unlucky and the lock only opened with the last password, after
they had tried all possible combinations. How many passwords
did they end up checking?
If you can’t solve a problem, try to find a simpler version of the
problem that you can solve. This technique can come in handy
many times.
Instead of a 5-digit lock, let us assume we have a 2-digit lock and try
to find out how many passwords are possible.
There are 10 options for the first digit (0 to 9). For each of these, there
are 10 options for the second digit (If 0 is the first digit then 00, 01, 02,
03, …, 09 are possible). Therefore the total number of combinations for
a 2-digit lock is 10 × 10 = 100.
Now, suppose we have a 3-digit lock. For each of the earlier 100
(2-digit) passwords there are 10 choices for the third digit. So, there are
100 × 10 = 1000 combinations for a 3-digit lock. You can list them all: 000,
001, 002, ….., 997, 997, 999.

2.3 The Other Side of Powers
Imagine a line of length 16 units. Erasing half of it would result in
24 ÷ 2 =

2×2×2×2

Erasing half one more time would result in,

2×2

Halving 16 cm three times may be written as,
2×2×2×2

24 ÷ 23 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 2 = 21 = 2 units.

24 ÷ 23 = 24 – 3 = 21.

Let us define 20 in a way that the generalised form above holds true.

20 = 24 – 4 = 24 ÷ 24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 1.

In fact for any letter number a
20 = 2a – a = 2a ÷ 2a = 1.
In general,

xa ÷ xa = xa – a = x0, and so
1 = x0 ,
where x ≠ 0 and a is a counting number.

When a line of length 24 units is halved 5 times,

24 ÷ 25 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2 units.

Using the generalised form, we get 24 ÷ 25= 2(4 – 5) = 2– 1.

So, 2– 1 = 2 .
When a line of length 24 units is halved 10 times,
we get 24 ÷ 210= 2(4 – 10) = 2– 6 units.

2.4 Powers of 10
We have used numbers like 10, 100, 1000, and so on when writing Indian
numerals in an expanded form. For example,
47561 = (4 × 10000) + (7 × 1000) + (5 × 100) + (6 × 10) + 1.
This can be written using powers of 10 as
(4 × 104) + (7 × 103) + (5 × 102) + (6 × 101) + (1 × 100).
Write these numbers in the same way: (i) 172, (ii) 5642, (iii) 6374.
How can we write 561.903?
561.903 = (5 × 100) + (6 × 10) + 1 + (9 × 1 ) + (0 × 1 ) + (3 × 1 ).
Writing it using powers of 10, we have

(ii) The number of stars in our galaxy is 1,00,00,00,00,000.
(iii) The mass of the Earth is 59,76,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 kg.
As the number of digits increases, it becomes difÏcult to read the
numbers correctly. We may miscount the number of zeroes or place
commas incorrectly. We will then read the wrong value. It is like getting
₹5,000 when you were supposed to get ₹50,000. The number of zeroes is
more important than the initial digits in several cases.
Can we use the exponential notation to simplify and read these very
large numbers correctly?
For example, the number 5900 can be expressed as —
5900 = 590 × 10 = 590 × 101
= 59 × 100 = 59 × 102
= 5.9 × 1000 = 5.9 × 103
= 0.59 × 10000 = 0.59 × 104.
Any number can be written as the product of a number between
1 and 10 and a power of 10. For example,
5900 = 5.9 × 103

20800 = 2.08 × 104

80,00,000 = 8 × 106

Write the large-number facts we read just before in this form.
In scientific notation or scientific form (also called standard form),
we write numbers as x × 10 y, where x ≥ 1 and x < 10 is the coefÏcient and
y, the exponent, is any integer. Often, the exponent y is more important
than the coefÏcient x. When we write the 2 crore population of Mumbai
as 2 × 107, the 7 is more important than the 2. Indeed, if the 2 is changed
to 3, the population increases by one-half, i.e., 2 crore to 3 crore, whereas
if the 7 is changed to 8, the change in population is 10 times, i.e., 2 crores
to 20 crores. Therefore, the standard form explicitly mentions the
exponent, which indicates the number of digits.
If we say that the population of Kohima is 1,42,395, then it gives the
impression that we are quite sure about this number up to the units
place. When we use large numbers, in most cases, we are more concerned
about how big a quantity or measure is, rather than the exact value. If
we are only sure that the population is around 1 lakh 42 thousand, we
can write it as 1.42 × 105. If we can only be certain that it is around 1 lakh
40 thousand, we write it as 1.4 × 105. The number of digits in the coefÏcient
reflects how well we know the number. The most important part of any

31

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

number written in scientific form is the exponent, and then the first
digit of the coefÏcient. The digits following the coefÏcient are small
corrections to the first digit.

2.5 Did You Ever Wonder?
Last year, we looked at interesting thought experiments in the chapter
on Large Numbers. Let us continue this journey.
Nanjundappa wants to donate jaggery equal to Roxie’s weight and
wheat equal to Estu’s weight. He is wondering how much it would cost.

What would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated jaggery? What
would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated wheat?
In order to find out, let us first describe the relationships among the
quantities present.
Worth of jaggery (in rupees) = Roxie’s weight in kg × cost of 1 kg jaggery.
Worth of wheat (in rupees) = Estu’s weight in kg × cost of 1 kg wheat.
Make necessary and reasonable assumptions for the unknowns and find
the answers. Remember, Roxie is 13 years old and Estu is 11 years old.
Assuming Roxie’s weight to be 45 kg and the cost of 1 kg of jaggery to be
₹70, the worth of donated jaggery is 45 × 70 = ₹3150. Assuming Estu’s
weight to be 50 kg and the cost of 1 kg of wheat to be ₹50, the worth of
donated wheat is 50 × 50 = ₹2500.
The practice of offering goods equal to the weight of a person, called
Tulābhāra or Tulābhāram, is quite old and is still followed in many
places in Southern India. It is a symbol of bhakti (surrendering oneself),
a token of gratitude; it also supports the community.
Roxie wonders, “Instead of jaggery if we use 1-rupee coins, how many
coins are needed to equal my weight?”. How can we find out?
For questions like these, you can consider following the steps suggested
below.
1. Guessing: Make an instinctive (quick) guess of what the answer could
be, without any calculations.

33

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

2. Calculating using estimation and approximation —
(i)

Describe the relationships among the quantities that are needed
to find the answer.
(ii) Make reasonable assumptions and approximations if the required
information is not available.
(iii) Compute and find the answer (and check how close your guess
was).
Would the number of coins be in hundreds, thousands, lakhs, crores, or
even more? Make an instinctive guess.
Find the answer by making necessary and
reasonable assumptions and approximations for
the unknowns. Remember, we are not looking for
an exact answer but a reasonably close estimate.

How about measuring
to find out the weight
of a 1-rupee coin?

Initially, your guesses may be very far off from the answer and
it is perfectly fine! You will get better at it like as you do it often
and in different situations. Guessing and estimating can build
intuition about numbers and various quantities.
Estu asks, “What if we use 5-rupee coins or 10-rupee notes instead?
How much money could it be?”
Make an instinctive guess first. Then find out (make necessary and
reasonable assumptions about the unknown details and find the
answers).
Estu says, “When I become an adult, I would like to donate notebooks
worth my weight every year”. Roxie says, “When I grow up, I would like
to do annadāna (offering grains or meals) worth my weight every year”.
How many people might benefit from each of these offerings in a
year? Again, guess first before finding out.

Math
Talk

Roxie and Estu overheard someone saying — “We did pādayātra for
about 400 km to reach this place! We arrived early this morning.”
How long ago would they have started their journey?
Find answers by making necessary assumptions and approximations.
Do guess first before calculating to check how close your guess was!
Note to the Teacher: Assumptions can vary greatly at times, and as a result the
answers computed using these you can also vary. This is perfectly alright. Modelling
the situation properly is crucial, which can also be done in different ways sometimes.
The accuracy of the assumed numbers or quantities can get better with exposure
and practice.

Pādayātra, is the traditional practice of walking long distances as part
of a religious or spiritual pursuit. People across religions in our country
observe similar forms of pilgrimage or spiritual walking, although they
may have different names or purposes.
Some of the pilgrimages are Ajmer Sharif Dargah Ziyarat,
Pandharpur Wari, Kānwar Yatra, Sabarimala Yatra, Sammed
Shikharji Yatra, Lumbini to Sarnath Yatra.

Before the rise of modern transport, people moved from one place to
another by walking — sometimes merchants, sages, and scholars walked
thousands of kilometres to different parts of the world across deserts,
mountains, and rivers.
How many times can a person circumnavigate (go around the world) the
Earth in their lifetime if they walk non-stop? Consider the distance around
the Earth as 40,000 km.

Linear Growth vs. Exponential Growth
Roxie tells Estu about a science-fiction novel she is reading where they
build a ladder to reach
the moon, “... I wonder if
we actually had a ladder
like that, how many steps
would it have?”.
What do you think? Make
an instinctive guess first.
Would the number of steps
be in thousands, lakhs,
crores, or even more?
To find out, we would
need to know the gap between consecutive steps of the ladder. Let’s
assume a reasonable distance of 20 cm. Visualising the problem as shown,

35

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

We have to find out how many 20 cm make 3,84,400 km.
If we calculate the value, we get the result as 1,92,20,00,000 steps, which
is 192 crore and 20 lakh steps or 1 billion 922 million steps. The fixed
increase in the distance from the earth with each step (a 20 cm gain after
each step) is called linear growth.
To cover the distance between the Earth and the Moon, it takes
1,92,20,00,000 steps with linear growth whereas it takes just 46 folds of
a piece of paper with exponential growth! Linear growth is additive,
whereas exponential growth is multiplicative.
20 + 20 + 20 + …………

Some examples of exponential growth we have seen earlier in
this chapter are ‘The Stones that Shine’, ‘Magical Pond’, ‘How Many
Combinations’. We shall explore more such interesting examples in a
later chapter and also in the next grade.
Can you come up with some examples of linear growth and of
exponential growth?

Getting a Sense for Large Numbers
Last year, we learnt about lakhs and crores, as well as millions and
billions. A lakh is 105 (1,00,000), a crore is 107 (1,00,00,000), and an arab
is 109 (1,00,00,00,000), whereas a million is 106 (1,000,000) and a billion
is 109 (1,000,000,000).
You might know the size of the world’s human population. Have you
ever wondered how many ants there might be in the world or how long ago
humans emerged? In this section, we shall explore numbers significantly
larger than arabs and billions. We shall use powers of 10 to represent and
compare these numbers in each case.

2.5 A Pinch of History

42

In the Lalitavistara, a Buddhist treatise from the first century BCE, we see
number - names for odd powers of ten up to 1053. The following occurs
as part of the dialogue between the mathematician Arjuna and Prince
Gautama, the Bodhisattva.
“Hundred kotis are called an ayuta (109), hundred ayutas a niyuta (1011),
hundred niyutas a kankara (1013), …, hundred sarva-balas a visamjnagati (1047), hundred visamjna-gatis a sarvajna (1049), hundred sarvajnas
a vibhutangama (1051), a hundred vibhutangamas is a tallakshana (1053).”
Mahaviracharya gives a list of 24 terms (i.e., up to 1023) in his treatise
Ganita-sara-sangraha. An anonymous Jaina treatise Amalasiddhi gives a
list with a name for each power of ten up to 1096 (dasha-ananta). A Pali
grammar treatise of Kāccāyana lists number-names up to 10140, named
asaṅkhyeya.

Power Play

For expressing high powers of ten, Jaina and Buddhist texts use bases
like sahassa (thousand) and koṭi (ten million); for instance, prayuta (106)
would be dasa sata sahassa (ten hundred thousand).
The modern naming is similar to this, where we say,
A hundred
thousand is a lakh

100 × 1000 = 1,00,000

102 × 103 = 105

A hundred lakhs
is a crore

100 × 1,00,000 = 1,00,00,000

102 × 105 = 107

A hundred crores 100 × 1,00,00,000 = 1,00,00,00,000
is an arab

102 × 107 = 109

A hundred arab is
a kharab

102 × 109 = 1011

100 × 1,00,00,00,000
= 1,00,00,00,00,000

Continuing this, a hundred kharab is a neel (1013), a hundred neel is a
padma (1015), a hundred padma is a shankh (1017) and a hundred shankh
is a maha shankh (1019).
In the American/International system, we say
A thousand thousand
is a million

1000 × 1000 = 1,000,000

103 × 103 = 106

A thousand million is 1000 × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000,000 103 × 106 = 109
a billion
A thousand billion is
an trillion

1000 × 1,000,000,000
= 1,00,000,000,000

103 × 109 = 1012

Continuing this, a thousand trillion is a quadrillion (1015). This pattern
continues. Observe the names million (106), billion (109), trillion (1012),
quadrillion (1015), quintillion (1018), sextillion (1021), septillion (1024),
octillion (1027), nonillion (1030), decillion (1033).
What does the first part of each name denote?
The number 10100 is also called a googol. The estimated number
of atoms in the universe is 1078 to 1082. The number 10googol is called a
googolplex. It is hard to imagine how large this number is!
The currency note with the highest denomination in India currently
is 2000 rupees. Guess what is the highest denomination of a currency
note ever, across the world. The highest numerical value banknote ever

bilpengő) printed in Hungary in 1946, but it was never issued. In 2009,
Zimbabwe printed a 100 trillion (1014) Zimbabwean dollar note, which at
the time of printing was worth about $30.

A STORY OF

3.1 Reema’s Curiosity
One lazy afternoon, Reema was flipping through an old book when —
whoosh! — a piece of paper slipped out and floated to the floor. She
picked it up and stared at the strange symbols all over it. “What is this?”
she wondered.
She ran to her father, holding the paper as if it were a secret treasure.
He looked at it and smiled. “Around 4000 years ago, there flourished a
civilisation in a region called Mesopotamia, in the western part of Asia,
containing a major part of the present-day Iraq and a few other
neighbouring countries. This is one of the ways they wrote their
numbers!”

Reema’s eyes lit up, “Seriously? These strange symbols were numbers?”
Her curiosity was sparked, and questions started swirling in her head.

A Story of Numbers

Sensing her curiosity, her father started telling her how the idea of
number and number representation evolved over the course of time,
across geographies, to finally reach its modern efÏcient form.
Get ready to travel back in time with them!
Humans had the need to count even as early as the Stone
Age. They were counting to determine the quantity of food
they had, the number of animals in their livestock, details
regarding trades of goods, the number of offerings given in
rituals, etc. They also wanted to keep track of the passing
days, e.g., to know and predict when important events such
as the new moon, full moon, or onset of a season would occur.
However, when they said or wrote down such numbers, they
didn’t make use of the numbers that we use today.
The structure of the modern oral and written numbers that we use
today had its origin thousands of years ago in India. Ancient Indian texts,
such as the Yajurveda Samhita, mentioned names of numbers based on
powers of 10, almost as we say them orally today. For example, they listed
names for the numbers one (eka), ten (dasha), hundred (shata), thousand
(sahasra), ten thousand (āyuta), etc., all the way up to 1012 and beyond.
The way we write our numbers today — using the digits 0 through 9 —
also originated and were developed in India, around 2000 years ago. The
first known instance of numbers being
written using ten digits, including the digit 0
(which was then notated as a dot), occurs in
the Bakhshali manuscript (c. 3rd century
CE). Aryabhata (c. 499 CE) was the first
mathematician to fully explain, and do
elaborate scientific computations with the Zero in the Bakhshali manuscript
Indian system of 10 symbols.
The Indian number system was transmitted to the Arab world
by around 800 CE. It was popularised in the Arab world by the great
Persian mathematician Al-Khwārizmī (after whom the word ‘algorithm’
is named) through his book On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals
(c. 825) and by the noted philosopher Al-Kindi through his work On the
Use of the Hindu Numerals (c. 830).
From the Arab world, the Hindu numerals were transmitted to Europe
and to parts of Africa by around 1100 CE. Though Al-Khwārizmī’s work
on calculation with Hindu numerals was translated into Latin, it was the
Italian mathematician Fibonacci who around the year 1200 really made
the case to Europe to adopt the Indian numerals. However, the Roman
numerals were so ingrained in European thinking and writing at the
time that the Indian numerals did not gain widespread use for several
more centuries. But eventually, during the European Renaissance and
by the 17th century, not adopting them became impossible or it would
impede scientific progress.

49

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

“The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten
symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in
India. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance and profound
importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated
calculations and placed arithmetic foremost among useful inventions.”
— Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749 – 1827)
Their use then spread to every continent, and are now used in every
corner of the world.
Because European scholars learned the Indian numerals from the
Arab world, they called them ‛Arabic numerals’ to reflect their European
perspective. On the other hand, as noted above, Arab scholars, such as
Al-Khwārizmī and Al-Kindi, called them ‛Hindu numerals’. During the
period of European colonisation, the European term Arabic numbers
became widely used. However, in recent years, this mistake is being
corrected in many textbooks and documents around the world, including
in Europe. The most commonly used terminologies for the numbers we
use today are ‛Hindu numerals’, ‛Indian numerals’, and the transitional
‛Hindu-Arabic numerals’. It is worth noting that the word ‛Hindu’ here
does not refer to a religion, but rather a geography/people from whom
these numbers came.
The shape of the digits 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 used to write numbers in the Indian
number system today evolved over a period of time, as shown below:

Evolution of the digits used in the Indian number system

Prior to the global adoption of the Indian system of numerals, different
groups of people used different methods of representing numbers. We

50

A Story of Numbers

shall take a glimpse of some of them. We will not be looking at different
systems in a chronological order, but rather an order that shows us the
main stages in the development of the idea of number representation.
But first, let us explore some of the foundational ideas needed to count
and to determine the number of objects in a given collection.

The Mechanism of Counting
Imagine that we are living in the Stone Age, say, around ten thousand
years ago. Suppose we have a herd of cows. Here are some natural
questions that we might ask about our herd —
Q1. How do we ensure that all cows have returned safely after
grazing?
Q2. Do we have fewer cows than our neighbour?
Q3. If there are fewer, how many more cows would we need so
that we have the same number of cows as our neighbour?

Math
Talk

We need to tackle these questions without the use of the
number names or written numbers of the Hindu number
system. How do we do it?
Here are some possible methods.
Method 1: We could tackle the questions by using pebbles, sticks or
any object that is available in abundance. Let us choose sticks. For every
cow in the herd, we could keep a stick. The final collection of sticks tells
us the number of cows, which can be used to check if any cows have
gone missing.

51

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

This way of associating each cow with a stick, such that no two cows are
associated or mapped to the same stick is called a one-to-one mapping.
This mapping can then be used to come up with a way to represent
numbers, as shown in the table.

How will you use such sticks to answer the other two questions (Q2 and
Q3)?
Method 2: Instead of objects, we could use a standard sequence of
sounds or names. For example, we could use the sounds of the letters
of any language. While counting, we could make a one-to-one mapping
between the objects and the letters: that is, associate each object to be
counted with a letter, following the letter-order. This mapping can then
be used to come up with a way of verbally representing numbers.
For example, we get the following number representation if we use
English letters ‘a’ to ‘z’.

An obvious limitation of using only the letters of the English alphabet
in this form is that it cannot be used to count collections having more
than 26 objects.
How many numbers can you represent in this way using the sounds
of the letters of your language?

Method 3: We could use a sequence of written symbols as follows.

Do you see a way of extending this method to represent bigger numbers
as well? How?
From the discussion above, we see that for counting and finding the
size of a collection, we need a standard sequence of objects, or names,
or written symbols, that has a fixed order. Let us call this standard
sequence a number system. A collection of objects can be counted by
making a one-to-one mapping between them and the standard sequence,
following the sequence order.
Since there is no end to numbers, the challenge is to come up with
an unending standard sequence/number system that is easy to count
with. Using sticks gives an unending standard sequence/number system.
However, it is not convenient to count larger collections, as we will
need as many sticks as the number of objects being counted. Using the
sounds of the letters of a language, as in Method 2, is convenient for
the counting process but is not an unending standard sequence/number
system. The standard sequence/number system given in Method 3 was
actually the system used in Europe before it got replaced by the Hindu
number system. It is called the Roman number system. It was widely
used in Europe for centuries, and was convenient for many purposes,
but had the similar drawback that one cannot write arbitrarily large
numbers without introducing more and more symbols. We will learn
more about this system of writing numbers later on.

53

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

As illustrated by the three methods, history gives us examples of
number systems formed using physical objects (such as sticks, pebbles,
body parts, etc.), names, and written symbols. Some groups of people
had numbers represented both by physical objects as well as by names,
while others like the Chinese had all three forms of representation. The
symbols occurring in a written number system are called numerals.
For example, 0, 1, 5, 36, 193, etc., are some of the numerals occurring in
the Hindu number system. Numerals representing ‘smaller’ numbers
always had names, and so a number system composed of written
symbols always went hand in hand with a number system composed of
names, as is the case with the modern-day Hindu system.
Figure it Out
1. Suppose you are using the number system that uses sticks to
represent numbers, as in Method 1. Without using either the
number names or the numerals of the Hindu number system,
give a method for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing
two numbers or two collections of sticks.

2. One way of extending the number system in Method 2 is by
using strings with more than one letter — for example, we could
use ‘aa’ for 27. How can you extend this system to represent all
the numbers? There are many ways of doing it!

3.2 Some Early Number Systems
I. Use of Body Parts

parts for counting. Here is how a group of people in Papua New Guinea
used and still use their body parts as the standard sequence/number
system.

II. Tally Marks on Bones and Other Surfaces
One of the oldest methods of number representation is by making
notches — marks cut on a surface such as a bone or a wall of a cave.
These marks are also called tally marks.
In this method, a mark is made for each object that is being counted.
So the final collection of marks represents the total number of objects. This
method is very similar to the method of using sticks to count (Method 1),
except for the fact that a mark is made instead of adding a stick.
Archaeologists have discovered bones dating back more than 20,000
years that seem to have tally marks. The oldest known such bones with
markings that are thought to represent numbers are the Ishango bone
and the Lebombo bone. The Ishango bone, dating back 20,000 to 35,000
years, was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It features
notches arranged in columns, possibly indicating calendrical systems.
The Lebombo bone, discovered in South Africa, is an even older tally
stick with 29 notches, estimated to be around 44,000 years old. It is
considered one of the oldest mathematical artefacts, and may have
served as a tally stick or lunar calendar.

III. Number Names Obtained by Counting in Twos
A group of indigenous people in Australia called the Gumulgal had the
following words for their numbers.
Gumulgal
(Australia)
1. urapon
2. ukasar
3. ukasar-urapon
4. ukasar-ukasar
5. ukasar-ukasar-urapon
6. ukasar-ukasar-ukasar
Can you see how their number names are formed?
The number name for 3 is composed of number names of 2 and 1.
The number name for 4 is composed of two occurrences of the number
name for 2.
Can you see how the names of the other numbers are formed?
The numbers are counted in 2s, using which the number names are
formed: 3 = 2 + 1, 4 = 2 + 2, 5 = 2 + 2 + 1, 6 = 2 + 2 + 2.
Gumulgal called any number greater than 6 ras.
There is a very interesting and puzzling historical phenomenon
associated with this number system. Look at the following number
systems of a group of indigenous people in South America, and the
Bushmen of South Africa:

2 - ahage
3 - ahage tokale

A Story of Numbers

Despite being so far apart geographically, and with no trace of contact
between them, these three groups have developed equivalent number
systems! Historians have wondered how this happened. One theory is
that these three groups of people may have had common ancestors, who
used this number system. In course of time, their descendants migrated
to these places.
Even though the number system of Gumulgal had number names for
numbers only till 6, we can see the emergence of an idea here. Counting
in 2s is more efÏcient for representing numbers than, for example, a tally
system. A general form which this idea has taken in different number
systems is as follows: count in groups of a certain number (like 2 in the
case of Gumulgal’s system), and use the word or symbol associated with
this group size to represent bigger numbers. Some of the commonly
used group sizes in different number systems have been 2, 5, 10 and 20.
You can find the idea of counting by 5s in the Roman system (Table 1).
This idea of counting in a certain group size and using it to represent
numbers is an important idea in the history of the evolution of
number systems.
One of the phenomena that could have led people to this idea might
be the human limit for immediately knowing the size of a collection at a
glance. Let us try out the following activity.
Quickly count the number of objects in each of the following boxes:

Up to what group size could you immediately see the number of
objects without counting? Most humans find it difÏcult to count groups
having 5 or more objects in a single glance.
This limit of perception could have prompted people using tally
Math
Talk
marks to replace every group of, say, 5 marks, with a new symbol,
as seen in the system shown in Table 1.

57

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

What could be the difÏculties with using a number system that counts
only in groups of a single particular size? How would you represent a
number like 1345 in a system that counts only by 5s?
Even though counting in groups of a particular size and using it for
number representation is more efÏcient than the tally system, this
method can still become cumbersome for larger numbers. The next
system shows a refinement of this idea.

IV. The Roman Numerals

We have already seen the Roman number system till 20 (Table 1). We
have seen that it uses I for 1, V for 5, X for 10.
To get the Roman numeral for any number till 39, it is first grouped
into as many 10s as possible, the remaining is grouped into as many 5s
as possible, and finally the remaining is grouped into 1s.
Example: Let us take the number 27.
27 = 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1
So, 27 in Roman numerals is XXVII.
Instead of representing 50 as XXXXX, a new symbol is given to it: L.
Following the way the number 4 is represented as 1 less than 5 — that
is, as IV — 40 is represented as 10 less than 50 — that is, as XL. However,
people using this system were not always consistent with this practice.
Sometimes, 40 was also represented as XXXX.
The Roman number system introduces newer symbols to represent
certain bigger numbers. Let us call all these numbers that have a new
basic symbol as landmark numbers. Here are some of the landmark
numbers of the Roman system and their associated numerals.

These symbols are used to denote other numbers as well. For example,
consider the number 2367. Writing it as a sum of landmark numbers
starting from 1000 such that we take as many 1000s as possible, 500s as
possible, and so on, we get
2367 = 1000 + 1000 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 50 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1
So in Roman numerals, this number is MMCCCLXII.
Figure it Out
1. Represent the following numbers in the Roman system.
(i) 1222

(ii) 2999

(iii) 302

(iv) 715

We see how vastly efÏcient this system is compared to some of the
previous number systems that we have seen. This system seems to have
evolved out of the ancient Greek number system in around the 8th
century BCE in Rome, and evolved over time. It spread throughout
Europe with the expansion of the Roman empire.
The efÏciency of this system is due to the grouping of a given number
by not just one group size, but a sequence of group sizes that we
call landmark numbers, and then using these landmark numbers
to represent the given number. This idea is the next important
breakthrough in the history of the evolution of number systems.
Despite the relative efÏciency of the Roman system, it doesn’t lend
itself to an easy performance of arithmetic operations, particularly
multiplication and division.
Example: Try adding the following numbers without converting them
to Hindu numerals:
(a) CCXXXII + CCCCXIII
Let us find the total number of Is, Xs, and Cs, and group them
starting from the largest landmark number.
Apparently, it looks like the largest landmark number is C, but
note that 5 Cs (100s) make a D (500). So the sum is

without converting them to Hindu numerals? Try to find the product
of the following pairs of landmark numbers: V × L, L × D, V × D,

MDCCCLII

People using the Roman system made use of a calculating tool called
the abacus to perform their arithmetic operations. We will see what it
is in a later section. However, only specially trained people used this tool
for calculation.
While going through the number systems discussed above, it should
not be understood that, historically, one system developed as an
improvement over the previous system. This point should be kept in
mind when studying the upcoming number systems too. The actual story
of how each of the number systems developed is much more complex,
and many times not clearly known, and so we will not try to trace this
in the chapter.

3.3 The Idea of a Base
I. The Egyptian Number System

We are now going to see a written number system that the Egyptians
developed around 3000 BCE. In this system, we see the use of landmark
numbers to group and represent a given number. However, what makes
this system special is its sequence of landmark numbers.
Imagine making collections of pebbles. The first landmark number
is 1. Group together 10 collections of the previous landmark number (1).
Its size is the second landmark number which is 10. Group together 10
collections of the previous landmark number (10). Its size is the third
landmark number which is 10 × 10 = 100, and so on.

61

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

Each landmark number is 10 times the previous one. Since 1 is the
first landmark number, they are all powers of 10. The following are the
symbols given to these numbers —

As in the case of Roman numbers, a given number is counted in groups
of the landmark numbers, starting from the largest landmark number
less than the given number. This is then used to assign the numeral.
For example 324 which equals 100 + 100 + 100 + 10 + 10 + 4 is written
as
.

II. Variations on the Egyptian System and the Notion of
Base
Instead of grouping together 10 collections of size equal to the previous
landmark number (as in the case of the Egyptian system), can we get
a number system by grouping together 5 collections of size equal to
the previous landmark number? Can this 5 be replaced by any positive
integer?
Let us examine this possibility. Let 1 be the first landmark number.
Group together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark
number (1). Its size is the second landmark number which is 5.
Group together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark
number (5). Its size is the third landmark number which is 5 × 5 = 25.
Group together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark
number (5). Its size is the fourth landmark number which is 5 × 25 = 125.

62

A Story of Numbers

Thus, we have a new number system where each landmark number
is 5 times the previous one. Since 1 is the first landmark number, they
are all powers of 5.
50 = 1

51 = 5

52 = 25

53 = 125

54 = 625

55 = 3125

Express the number 143 in this new system.
Let us start grouping, starting with the size 53 = 125, as this is the
largest landmark number smaller than 143. We get—
143 = 125 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1.
So the number 143 in the new system is

.

Number systems having landmark numbers in which the
(a) first landmark number is 1, and
(b) every next landmark number is obtained by multiplying the
current landmark number by some fixed number n is said to
be a base-n number system.
The Egyptian number system is a base-10 system, and the number
system that we created is a base-5 system. A base-10 number system is
also called a decimal number system.

powers of a number? To understand this, let us perform some arithmetic

Contrast the addition done in a base-n number system with that
done in the Roman system. In the Roman system, the grouping and
rearranging has to be done carefully as it is not always by the same size
that each landmark number has to be grouped to get the next one.
The advantage of a number system with a base becomes more evident
when we consider multiplication.
How to multiply two numbers in Egyptian numerals?
Let us first consider the product of two landmark numbers.

What would be a simple rule to multiply a number with ?
As has been seen, a process of multiplying two numbers involves the
multiplication of landmark numbers. When the landmark numbers are
powers of a number, then their product is another landmark number.
This fact simplifies the process of multiplication. However, this is not the
case with the Roman numerals, which is why multiplication using them
is difÏcult.
Thus, a number system whose landmark numbers are powers of
a number, i.e., a number system with a base, is efÏcient not only in
number representation but also in its utility in carrying out arithmetic
operations.
The idea of a number system with a base was a turning point in the
history of the evolution of number systems. Our modern Hindu number
system is built on this structure.
Abacus that Makes Use of the Decimal System
In around the 11th century, even the people still using the Roman
numerals started using a calculating device — the abacus — constructed
using a decimal system. It was a board with lines, as shown in the Fig. 3.1.
Starting from the line that stood for 1, each successive line stood for a
successive power of 10.

Fig. 3.1: Abacus

Numbers were represented in it as follows: the given number was
first grouped into the landmark numbers (powers of 10), in exactly the
same way we have been grouping them so far. For each power of 10, as
many counters were placed on its line as the number of times it occurred

68

A Story of Numbers

in the grouping. The presence of a counter above a line contributed a
value of 5.
For example let us take the number 3426. It can be grouped as
3426 = 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 10 + 10+ 1 + 1 +
1+1+1+1
This number was represented as shown in Fig. 3.1. Notice how the
6 ones are represented.
To get an idea of how the abacus was used for calculations, let us
consider a simple addition problem: 2907 + 43. The two numbers were
taken on either side of the vertical partition.

How would you use this to find the sum?
The counters along each line were brought together. What is to be
done if the total in a line exceeded 10?
Hint: In this problem, the 7 ones and the 3 ones together make 10 ones
which contributes a counter to the line representing 10s.

III. Shortcomings of the Egyptian System
Despite being a number system that enabled relatively efÏcient number
representations for numbers till a crore (107), and relatively easy
computations, the Egyptian system had a drawback.
If larger and larger numbers needed to be represented, then there
was a need for inventing an unending sequence of symbols for higher
and higher powers of 10. Here we see the original challenge of number
representation resurfacing in a different form!
The next and the final idea in the history of the evolution of number
systems not only solves this problem but also remarkably simplifies
number representation and computations!

numerals has one of the symbols occurring 10 or more times?

3.4. Place Value Representation
I. The Mesopotamian Number System

In the beginning, the number system used in ancient Mesopotamia had
different symbols for different landmark numbers. In later times, it
became a base-60 system, also called the sexagesimal system, with a
very efÏcient number representation.
It has puzzled many why they chose base 60. Different theories exist to
explain this, ranging from the connection between 60 and the periods of
some important events (like the length of their lunar month which had
30 days, or the time taken for the Sun to complete one revolution around
the Earth when Earth is taken to be stationary), the ease of representing
fractions (we will not go into this here), their earlier sequence of
landmark numbers — 1, 10, 60, 600, 3600, 36000,… — getting reduced to
only the powers of 60, and so on.
The influence of the Mesopotamian sexagesimal system, also known
as the Babylonian number system, can be seen even now in our units
of time measurements — 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds.
for 10.
This system used the symbol for 1 and
Let us now briefly pause on the study of their number system, and
ideate on how one can build an efÏcient number system using the
Mesopotamian features seen so far.

Reproduction of a Mesopotamian Tablet

Example: Let us represent the number 640 in this system.
Grouping it into landmark numbers, we see that
640 = (10) × 60 + 40.
If we use the Egyptian idea, this number would be represented using
10 1 s, and 40 would be represented using 4 s.

71

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

Can we represent this more compactly?
We can simply represent this number as

which can be read as ten 60s and one 40, just as we have written in the
equation.
Example: Let us try another number — 7530.
7530 = (2) ×3600 + (5) × 60 + 30
So, its representation would be

Note that when a number is grouped into powers of 60 for its
representation, no power of 60 can occur 60 or more times. If this
happens, then 60 of them can be grouped to form the next power of 60.
For example, consider the expression —
(1) × 3600 + (70) × 60 + 2 = (1) × 602 + (60 + 10) × 60 + 2
= (1) × 602 + 602 + (10) × 60 + 2
= (2) × 602 + (10) × 60 + 2
Therefore, any number can be represented using the numerals from
1 – 59, along with the numerals for landmark numbers.
Now, what if we make the representation even more compact by
dropping the symbols for the different powers of 60 altogether?

72

A Story of Numbers

This is exactly what the Mesopotamians did! In their numeral, the
rightmost set of symbols showed the number of 1s, the set of symbols to
its left showed the number of 60s, the next showed the number of 3600s
and so on. Whenever there was no occurrence of a power of 60, a blank
space was given in that position.
It does not seem that the Mesopotamians arrived at this idea in the
same way we did. Some scholars suggest that the similarity of symbols
given to the landmark numbers 1 and 60 in their earlier number system,
and an accidental usage of them, might have made them stumble upon
this idea.
Figure it Out
1. Represent the following numbers in the Mesopotamian system —
(i) 63

(ii) 132

(iii) 200

(iv) 60

(v) 3605

Thus, we can see how the Mesopotamian system removes the need for
generating an unending sequence of symbols for the landmark numbers
by making use of the positions where the symbols are written. Such a
number system (having a base) that makes use of the position of each
symbol in determining the landmark number that it is associated with is
called a positional number system or a place value system.
This idea of place value marks the highest point in the history of
evolution of number systems, and gives a very elegant solution to the
problem of representing the unending sequence of numbers using only
a finite number of different symbols!
The Mesopotamian system however cannot be considered a fully
developed place value system. It has certain defects that lead to confusion
while reading a number.
Look at the representation of 60. What will be the representation for
3,600?
While writing the numerals, the spacing between symbols was not
given the way we are giving it here. It was also difÏcult to maintain a
consistent spacing for blanks across different manuscripts written by
different people. These created ambiguities. For example, consider the
representations of the following numbers —

73

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

Because of the ambiguity in finding which symbols correspond to
which powers of 60, the same numeral can be read in different ways.
Even in our representation which uses uniform spacing between
symbols for different powers of 60, it is difÏcult to know the number of
blanks between two sets of symbols, as in the representation of 36002.
To address the issue arising out of blank spaces, the later
Mesopotamians used a brilliant idea of assigning a ‘placeholder’ symbol
to denote a blank space. This is like the 0 (zero) we use in our system.
Thus, zero — the symbol that shows nothingness — is indispensable as a
placeholder in a place value system in which numbers are written in an
unambiguous manner.
Even with the problem arising out of blank spaces solved, other
ambiguities still remained in the system. For example, the placeholder
symbol was primarily used in the middle of numbers and not at the
end; so they would not use it to represent a number like (what we would
write as) 3600.

II. The Mayan Number System

In Central America, there flourished a civilisation known as the Mayan
civilisation that made great intellectual and cultural progress between
the 3rd and 10th centuries CE. Among their intellectual achievements
stands their place value system designed independently of those in Asia.
They also made use of a placeholder symbol, for the modern-day ‘0’, that
looked like a seashell.

denote numbers from 1 to 19.
The symbols associated with different landmark numbers were
written one below the other with the lowermost set of symbols
corresponding to the number of 1s, the set above corresponding to the
number of 20s, the set above to the number of 360s and so on.
Represent the following numbers using the Mayan system:
(i) 77

(ii) 100

(iii) 361

(iv) 721

Because the Mayan system is not an actual base-20 system, it lacks the
advantages that a system with a base has for computations. Nevertheless,
their place value notation and their use of a placeholder symbol for zero
is considered an important advance in the history of number systems.
A curious fact is that we can still find the use of base-20 in the number
names of some European languages.

III. The Chinese Number System

The Chinese used two number systems — a written system for recording
quantities, and a system making use of rods for performing computations.
The numerals in the rod-based number system are called rod numerals.
Here we discuss the rod numerals, which are more efÏcient in writing
and computing with numbers than the written system of the Chinese.
The rod numerals developed in China by at least by 3rd century AD
and were used till the 17th century. It was a decimal system (base-10).
The symbols for 1 to 9 were as follows:

Like the Mesopotamians, the rod numerals used a blank space to
indicate the skipping of a place value. However, because of the slightly
more uniform sizes of the symbols for one through nine, the blank
spaces were easier to locate than in the Mesopotamian system.

Notice how similar the rod numerals are to the Hindu system.

place value system.

ideas of number representation? What are its landmark numbers? And
does it use a place value system?

As can be seen, the Hindu number system is a place value system.
The Hindu number system has had a symbol for 0 at least as early as
200 BCE. Because of the use of 0 as a digit, and the use of a single digit in
each position, this system does not lead to any kind of ambiguity when

78

A Story of Numbers

reading or writing numerals. It is for this reason that the Hindu number
system is now used throughout the world.
The use of 0 as a digit, and indeed as a number, was a breakthrough
that truly changed the world of mathematics and science. In Indian
mathematics, indeed, zero was not just used as a placeholder in the place
value system, but was also given the status of a number in its own right,
on par with other numbers. The arithmetic properties of the number 0
(e.g., that 0 plus any number is the same number, and that 0 times any
number is zero) were explicitly used by Aryabhata in his Āryabhaṭīya in
499 CE to compute with and do elaborate scientific computations using
Hindu numerals. The use of 0 as a number like any other number, on
which one can perform the basic arithmetic operations, was codified
by Brahmagupta in his work Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 628 CE, as we
learned in an earlier grade.
By introducing 0 as a number, along with the negative numbers,
Brahmagupta created what in modern terms is called a ring, i.e., a set of
numbers that is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication
(i.e., any two numbers in the set can be added, subtracted, or multiplied
to get another number in that set). These new ideas laid the foundations
for modern mathematics, and particularly for the areas of algebra and
analysis.
Hopefully, this gives you a sense of all the ideas that went into writing
and computing with numbers in the way that we do today. The discovery
of 0 and the resulting Indian number system is truly one of the greatest,
most creative, and most influential inventions of all time — appearing
constantly in our daily lives and forming the basis of much of modern
science, technology, computing, accounting, surveying, and more. The
next time you are writing numbers, think about the incredible history
behind them and all the deep ideas that went into their discovery!

A Story of Numbers

SUMMARY


To represent numbers, we need a standard sequence of objects,
names, or written symbols that have a fixed order. This standard
sequence is called a number system.



The symbols representing numbers in a written number system
are called numerals.



In a number system, landmark numbers are numbers that
are easily recognisable and used as reference points for
understanding and working with other numbers. They serve
as anchors within the number system, helping people to orient
themselves and make sense of quantities, particularly larger
ones.



A number system whose landmark numbers are the powers of
a number n is referred to as a base-n number system.



Number systems having a base that make use of the position
of a symbol in determining the landmark number that it is
associated with are called positional number systems or
place value systems.



Place value representations were used in the Mesopotamian
(Babylonian), Mayan, Chinese and Indian civilisations.



The system of numerals that we use throughout the world today
is the Hindu number system (also sometimes called the Indian
number system, or the Hindu-Arabic number system). It is a
place value system with (usually) 10 digits, including the digit
0 which is treated on par with other digits. Due to its use of 0
as a number, the system enables the writing of all numbers
unambiguously using just finitely many symbols, and also
enables efÏcient computation. The system originated in India
around 2000 years ago, and then spread across the world, and
is considered one of human history’s greatest inventions.

QUADRILATERALS

In this chapter, we will study some interesting types of four-sided
figures and solve problems based on them. Such figures are commonly
known as quadrilaterals. The word ‘quadrilateral’ is derived from Latin
words — quadri meaning four, and latus referring to sides.
Observe the following figures.

(i)

(ii)

(iv)

(iii)

(v)

Figs. (i), (ii), and (iii) are quadrilaterals, and the others are not. Why?
The angles of a quadrilateral are the angles between its sides, as
marked in Figs. (i), (ii), and (iii).
We will start with the most familiar quadrilaterals — rectangles and
squares.

Quadrilaterals

4.1 Rectangles and Squares
We know what rectangles are. Let us define them.
Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which —
(i) The angles are all right angles (90°), and
(ii) The opposite sides are of equal length.
The definition precisely states the conditions a quadrilateral has to
satisfy to be called a rectangle.
Are there other ways to define a rectangle?
Let us consider the following problem related to the construction of
rectangles.

A Carpenter’s Problem
A carpenter needs to put together
two thin strips of wood, as shown
in Fig. 1, so that when a thread is
passed through their endpoints, it
forms a rectangle.

B

C

O

She already has one 8 cm long
strip. What should be the length of
the other strip? Where should they
both be joined?
A
Fig. 1
Let us first model the structure
that the carpenter has to make. The
strips can be modelled as line segments. They are the diagonals of the
quadrilateral formed by their endpoints. For the quadrilateral to be a
rectangle, we need to answer the following questions —

D

1. What is the length of the other diagonal?
2. What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals?
3. What should the angle be between the diagonals?
Let us answer these questions using B
geometric reasoning (deduction). If
that is challenging, try to construct/
measure some rectangles.

C

To find the answers to these
questions, let us suppose that we
have placed the diagonals such that
their endpoints form the vertices of
a rectangle, as shown in Fig. 2.

AC = 8 cm

D

Deduction 1 — What is the length of the other diagonal?
This can be deduced using congruence as follows —

Since ABCD is a rectangle, we have
AB = CD
∠BAD = ∠CDA = 90°
AD is common to both triangles.
So, ∆ADC ≅ ∆DAB by the SAS congruence
condition.
A

D

Common side

Therefore, AC = BD, since they are corresponding parts of congruent
triangles. This shows that the diagonals of a rectangle always have the
same length.
So the other diagonal must also be 8 cm long. You can verify this
property by constructing/measuring some rectangles.
Deduction 2 — What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals?
This can also be found using congruence. Since we need to know the
relation between OA and OC, and OB and OD, which two triangles of the
rectangle ABCD should we consider?

∠3 + ∠2 + 90 = 180,
we have ∠3 + ∠2 = 90°.

D

Quadrilaterals

So, ∠1 = ∠2 (= 90° – ∠3).
Thus, by the AAS condition for congruence, ∆AOB ≅ ∆COD.
Hence OA = OC and OB = OD, since they are corresponding parts of
congruent triangles. So, O is the midpoint of AC and BD.
This shows that the diagonals of a rectangle always intersect at
their midpoints.
Therefore, to get a rectangle, the diagonals must be drawn so that
they are equal and intersect at their midpoints.
When the diagonals cross at their midpoints, we say that the diagonals bisect
each other. Bisecting a quantity means dividing it into two equal parts.
Verify this property by constructing some rectangles and measuring
their diagonals and the points of intersection.
Can the following equalities be used to establish that ∆AOD ≅ ∆COB?
AO = CO (proved above)
∠AOB = ∠COD (vertically opposite angles)

Hence, no matter what the angles between the diagonals are, if the
diagonals are equal and they bisect each other, then the angles of the
quadrilateral formed are 90° each, and the opposite sides are equal.
Thus, the quadrilateral is a rectangle.
Now we know how the wooden strips have to be put together to form
the vertices of a rectangle! They should be equal and connected at their
midpoints.

This method is actually used in practice to
make rectangles. Carpenters in Europe use
this method to get a rectangular frame. It is
also known that farmers in Mozambique,
a country in Africa, use this method while
constructing houses to get the base of the
house in a rectangular shape.

The Process of Finding Properties
As we have been seeing from lower grades,
properties of geometric objects such as parallel
lines, angles, and triangles can be deduced through geometric reasoning.
We will continue to deduce properties of special types of quadrilaterals
in this chapter.
Once you have deduced a property of a quadrilateral, it is good to verify
it with a real-world quadrilateral, either the quadrilateral constructed
on paper or simply a surface having the shape of the quadrilateral.
If you are not able to figure out the property using deduction, you
could experiment by taking real-world quadrilaterals and observing the
property through measurement. Note that these observations give
useful insights about the property, but with them, we can only form a
conjecture, that is, a statement about which we are highly confident,
but not yet sure if it always holds true. For example, constructing a
few rectangles and observing through measurement that their diagonals
bisect each other does not necessarily mean that this will always be the
case — can we be sure that the 1000th rectangle we construct will also
have this property? The only way we can be sure of this property is by
justifying or proving the statement, just as we did in Deduction 2.
Note to the Teacher: Gently encourage students to deduce or justify properties.
Whenever students face challenges in doing it, encourage them to experiment and
observe, and use their intuition to figure out the properties.

Quadrilaterals

The Carpenter’s Problem shows that rectangles can also be defined as
follows —
Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral whose diagonals are equal
and bisect each other.
Observe how different this definition is from the earlier one. Yet, both
capture the same class of quadrilaterals. Further, it turns out that the
first definition can be simplified.
In the earlier definition, we stated that a rectangle has (a) opposite sides
of equal length, and (b) all angles equal to 90°. Would we be wrong if we
just define a rectangle as a quadrilateral in which all the angles are 90°?
If you think that this definition is incomplete, try constructing a
quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90° but the opposite sides are
not equal.
Are you able to construct such a quadrilateral?
Let us prove why this is impossible.
Deduction 4 — What is the shape of a quadrilateral with all the
angles equal to 90°?
Consider a quadrilateral ABCD with all angles measuring 90°. What can
we say about the opposite sides of such a quadrilateral?

89

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

So, ∠1 = ∠2.
Thus, by the AAS congruence condition, ∆BAD ≅ ∆DCB.
Therefore, AD = CB, and DC = BA, since these are corresponding sides
of congruent triangles.
Is it wrong to write ∆BAD ≅ ∆CDB? Why?
Thus, we have established that if all the angles of a quadrilateral are
right angles, then the opposite sides have equal lengths. Therefore, the
quadrilateral is a rectangle. Thus, a rectangle can simply be defined as
follows —
Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90°.
Let us list the properties of a rectangle.
Property 1: All the angles of a rectangle are 90°.
Property 2: The opposite sides of a rectangle are equal.
Are the opposite sides of a rectangle parallel?
They definitely seem so. This fact can be justified using one of the
transversal properties.
Notice that AB acts as a transversal to AD B
and BC, and that ∠A + ∠B = 90° + 90° = 180°.
When the sum of the internal angles on
the same side of the transversal is 180°,
the lines are parallel. We can use this fact
to conclude that the lines AD and BC are
parallel, which we represent as AD || BC.
Can you similarly show that AB is
A
parallel to DC (AB||DC)?
Property 3: The opposite sides of a rectangle are parallel to each other.
Property 4: The diagonals of a rectangle are of equal length and they
bisect each other.

All these quadrilaterals are rectangles, including (iv). Quadrilateral
(iv) is a rectangle because all its angles are 90°. However, it is a special
kind of rectangle with all sides of equal length. We know that this
quadrilateral is also called a square.
Square: A square is a quadrilateral in which all the angles are equal
to 90°, and all the sides are of equal length.
Thus, every square is also a rectangle, but clearly every rectangle is
not a square.
Wait, which one of
them are you — an
Indian or a Malayali?
How can you be both?

This relation can be pictorially represented using a Venn diagram.
We have seen these diagrams before. In a Venn diagram, a set of objects
is represented as points inside a closed curve. Typically, these closed
curves are ovals or circles.
For example, the set of all squares is represented as

Each point in the region represents a square, thereby covering all the
possible squares.
Since every square is a rectangle, the Venn diagram representation of
these two sets would be as follows —

As in the previous case, let us try to
construct a square, one of whose diagonals is
of length 8 cm.
While solving the Carpenter’s Problem for
the case of a rectangle, we have seen that to

opposite sides of equal length), the diagonals
have to be drawn such that —
(i) they are of equal lengths, and
(ii) they bisect each other.

What more needs to be done to get equal sidelengths as well? Can this be

The angle between the diagonals can be found using the notion of congruence!
Suppose we join the equal diagonals such that they bisect each other
and result in a square. Let us label the square ABCD.

Since these angles are corresponding parts of congruent triangles,
they are equal. Further, these angles together form a straight angle. So
∠BOA + ∠BOC = 180°. Thus, these angles have to be 90° each.

92

Quadrilaterals

This shows that the diagonals of a square bisect each other at right
angles. This means that the diagonals have to be drawn such that they are
of equal lengths and bisect each other at right angles. Since the endpoints
of the diagonals uniquely determine the vertices of a quadrilateral, we
will get a square when the diagonals are joined this way.
Using this fact, construct a square with a diagonal of length 8 cm.

Properties of a Square
Since a square is a special type of rectangle, all the properties of a
rectangle hold true for a square.
Verify if this is true by going through geometric reasoning in Deduction
1 and Deduction 2, and see if they apply to a square as well.
Property 1: All the sides of a square are equal to each other.
Property 2: The opposite sides of a square are parallel to each other.
Property 3: The angles of a square are all 90°.
Property 4: The diagonals of a square are of equal length and they bisect
each other at 90°.
There is one more special property of a square.
What are the measures of ∠1, ∠2, ∠3, and ∠4? See if you can reason
and/or experiment to figure this out!

4.2 Angles in a Quadrilateral
Is it possible to construct a quadrilateral with three angles equal to 90°
and the fourth angle not equal to 90°?
You might have observed through constructions that this may not be
possible.
But why not?
This is due to a general property of quadrilaterals related to their
angles.
We have seen that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°. There is
a similar regularity in the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral.

Or, (∠1+ ∠4) + (∠3 + ∠6) +∠2 + ∠5 = 360°.
Since (∠1 + ∠4), (∠3 + ∠6), ∠2 and ∠5 are the angles of this quadrilateral,
we have the following result —
The sum of all angles in any quadrilateral is 360°.
This explains why it is impossible for a quadrilateral to have three
right angles, with the fourth angle not right angle.

4.3 More Quadrilaterals with Parallel Opposite
Sides
Rectangles (and therefore squares) have parallel opposite sides.
Are there quadrilaterals that have parallel opposite sides that are not
rectangles?
Let us try constructing one.
This can be easily done by drawing two pairs of parallel lines, ensuring
that they do not meet at right angles.
Construct such a figure by recalling how parallel lines can be
constructed using a ruler and a set-square,
or a compass and a ruler.

Observe the quadrilateral ABCD. It has

Is a rectangle a parallelogram?
A rectangle has opposite sides parallel. So, it satisfies the
parallelogram’s definition. Hence, it is indeed a parallelogram. More
specifically, a rectangle is a special kind of parallelogram with all its
angles equal to 90°.
Let us represent this relation using a Venn diagram.

To understand the relations between the sides and the angles of a

Deduction 6 — What can we say about the angles of a parallelogram?
In the parallelogram ABCD, AB||CD, and AD is a transversal to them.
∠A + ∠D = 180° (sum of the
internal angles on the same side of
a transversal).
Therefore,
∠D = 180 – ∠A = 180 – 30 = 150°.
Similarly, AD||BC, and AB and
A
CD are transversals to them.

D

C

5 cm

30°
4 cm

B

So, ∠A + ∠B = 180°.
So, ∠C + ∠D = 180°.
Using these equations, we get ∠B = 150° and ∠C = 30°.
We see that in this parallelogram, the adjacent pairs of angles add
up to 180° and opposite pairs of angles are equal.
Thus,
∠A + ∠B = 180°, ∠A + ∠D = 180°, ∠C + ∠D = 180°, and ∠B + ∠C = 180°.
And,
∠A = ∠C, and ∠B = ∠D.
Since the adjacent angles are the interior angles on the same side of
a transversal to a pair of parallel lines, they must add up to 180°.
What about the opposite angles? Will they be equal in all parallelograms?
If yes, how can we be sure?
R

Let us take one of the angles to be x.
What are the other angles?
Since ∠P + ∠R = 180°,
∠R = 180 – ∠P = 180 – x.
Similarly, since ∠A + ∠R = 180°,
x
∠A = 180 – ∠R = 180 – (180 – x) = 180 – 180 + x = x.
P
E
Thus, ∠P = ∠A = x.
Similarly, we can deduce that ∠ R = ∠E = 180 – x.
Therefore, this shows that the opposite angles of a parallelogram
are always equal.

AE = YS (as they are the opposite sides

The angles marked using a single arc

Thus, by the ASA condition, the triangles E

∆AOE ≅ ∆YOS.
Therefore, OA = OY, and OE = OS, since they are corresponding parts
of congruent triangles.
Thus, O is the midpoint of both diagonals.

rhombus is a parallelogram, and the

adjacent angles of a rhombus add up to

180°, and the opposite angles are equal
(verify that the arguments in Deduction 6 can be applied to a rhombus

Thus, in rhombus ABCD,
∠A = ∠C = 50°, and
∠D = ∠B = 180 – 50 = 130°.
So a rhombus is a parallelogram, and a rectangle is also a parallelogram.
How can this be represented using a Venn diagram?
Where will the set of squares occur in this diagram?
We know that a square is a rectangle. Since the opposite sides of a
square are parallel, a square is also a parallelogram. Further, since all

Trapezium
Parallelograms are quadrilaterals that have
parallel opposite sides. We get a new type
of quadrilateral if we relax this condition.

sides.

Construct a trapezium. Measure the base angles (marked in the figure).
Can you find the remaining angles without measuring them?
Since PQ||SR, we have
Property 1: ∠ S + ∠P = 180° and ∠R + ∠Q = 180°.
Using these facts, the remaining angles can easily be found. Verify
your answer after finding them.
When the non-parallel sides of a trapezium have the same lengths,
the trapezium is called an isosceles trapezium.
How do we construct an isosceles trapezium?

Consider line segments XY and WZ perpendicular to UV.
What type of quadrilateral is XWZY?
Since XW||UV,
a = 180° – ∠XYZ = 90°, and
b = 180° – ∠WZY = 90° (since the internal
angles on the same side of a transversal
add up to 180°)
Hence, XWZY is a rectangle.

Sum of Consecutive Numbers
Anshu is exploring sums of consecutive numbers. He has written the
following —
7 =3+4
10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
12 = 3 + 4 + 5
15 = 7 + 8
=4+5+6
=1+2+3+4+5

Now, he is wondering —
• “Can I write every natural number as a sum of consecutive
numbers?”
• “Which numbers can I write as the sum of consecutive numbers in
more than one way?”
• “Ohh, I know all odd numbers can be written as a sum of two
consecutive numbers. Can we write all even numbers as a sum of
consecutive numbers?”
• “Can I write 0 as a sum of consecutive numbers? Maybe I should
use negative numbers.”
Explore these questions and any others that may occur to you.

Hint: Use algebra and describe the 8 expressions in a general form.
You might have noticed that the results of all expressions are even

a factor 2 are also even numbers, for example, – 2, – 4, – 6, and so on.
Check if anyone in your class got an odd number.

Repeat this with other sets of 4 numbers.
Math
Is there a way to explain why this happens?
Talk
Hint: Think of the rules for parity of the sum or difference of two
numbers.
Explanation 1: Let us consider any of the 8 expressions formed by four
numbers a, b, c, and d. When one of its signs is switched, its value always
increases or decreases by an even number! Let us see why.
Consider one of the expressions: a + b – c – d.
Replacing +b by – b, we get
a – b – c – d.
By how much has the number changed? It has changed by
(a + b – c – d) – (a – b – c – d)
= a + b – c – d – a + b + c + d (notice how the signs changed when we
opened the second set of brackets)
= 2b (this is an even number).
If the difference between two numbers is even, can they have different
parities? No! So either both are even or both are odd.
Now, let us see what happens when a negative sign is switched to a
positive sign.
Replace any negative sign in the expression a + b – c – d with a positive
sign and find the difference between the two numbers.
What do you conclude from this observation?
Starting from any expression, we can get 7 expressions by switching one
or more ‘+’ and ‘–’ signs. Thus, all the expressions have the same parity!
Explanation 2: We know that
odd ± odd = even
even ± even = even
odd ± even = odd.
We have seen that the parity of a + b and a – b is the same, regardless
of the parities of a and b.
In short, a ± b have the same parity. By the same argument, a ± b + c
and a ± b – c have the same parity. Extending this further, we can say that
all the expressions a ± b ± c ± d have the same parity.

may be dear to you, it can be amusing and enriching to know
how others thought about it. Two tidbits: ‘share’ and ‘listen’.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

The expression 4m + 2q will always evaluate to an even number for
any integer values of m and q. We can justify this in two different ways —
• We know 4m is even and 2q is even for any integers m and q.
Therefore, their sum will also be even.
• The expression 4m + 2q is equal to the expression 2(2m + q). Here,
the expression 2(2m + q) means 2 times 2m + q. In other words, 2 is
a factor of this expression. Therefore, this expression will always
give an even number for any integers m and q.
For example, if m = 4 and q = – 9, the expression 4m + 2q becomes
4 × 4 + 2 × (–9) = – 2, which is an even number.
In the expression x 2 + 2, x 2 is even if x is even, and x 2 is odd if x is odd.
Therefore, the expression x 2 + 2 will not always give an even number.
An example and a non-example for when the expression evaluates to an
even number — (i) if x = 6, then x 2 + 2 = 38, and (ii) if x = 3, then x 2 + 2 = 11.
Similarly, determine and explain which of the other expressions always
give even numbers. Write a couple of examples and non-examples, as
appropriate, for each expression.
Write a few algebraic expressions which always give an even number.

6. If a number is divisible by both 9 and 4, it must be divisible by 36.
7. If a number is divisible by both 6 and 4, it must be divisible by 24.
In general, if A is divisible by k and A is also divisible by m, then
A is divisible by the LCM of k and m. This is because A is a multiple of

8. When you add an odd number to an even number we get a multiple
of 6.
Can I write an even and
an odd number as 2n and
2n+1 instead?

We know that multiples of 6 are all even
numbers. The sum of an odd number and an
even number will be an odd number. Therefore,
this statement is never true. We can also explain
this algebraically. Suppose,
(2n) + (2m + 1) = 6j,
where 2n is an even number, 2m + 1 is an odd
number, and 6j is a multiple of 6. Then
2n + 2m = 6j – 1
2 (n + m) = 6j – 1

which means 2(n + m), which is an even number, should be equal to
6j – 1, which is an odd number. This is never true.

5.2 Checking Divisibility Quickly
Earlier, you have learnt shortcuts to check whether a given number,
written in the Indian number system is divisible by 2, 4, 5, 8, and 10. Let
us revisit them.
Divisibility by 10, 5, and 2: If the units digit of a number is ‘0’, then
it is divisible by 10. Let us understand why this works through algebra.
We can write the general form of a number in the Indian system
using a set of letter-numbers. For example, a 5-digit number can be
expressed as, edcba denoting e × 10000 + d × 1000 + c × 100 + b × 10 + a. The
letter-numbers e, d, c, b, and a denote each digit of a 5-digit number.
Any number can be written in general as … dcba, where the letternumbers a, b, c and d represent the units, tens, hundreds and thousands
digit, respectively, and so on. As a sum of place values, this number is —
… +1000d + 100c + 10b + a.
(For example, in the number 4075, d = 4, c = 0, b = 7, and a = 5.)
We know that each place value, with the exception of the units place,
is a multiple of 10. So, 10b, 100c, … all will be multiples of 10. Hence, the
number will be divisible by 10 if and only if the units digit a is 0.
Similarly, explain using algebra why the divisibility shortcuts for 5, 2, 4,
and 8 work.
Let us now examine shortcuts to check divisibility by some other
numbers and explain why they work!

A Shortcut for Divisibility by 9
Can you say, without actually calculating, which of these numbers are
divisible by 9: 999, 909, 900, 90, 990?
All of them.

123

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

Can we say that any number made up of only the digits ‘0’ and ‘9’, in any
order, will always be divisible by 9?
Yes, if each digit is either 0 or 9, then each term in its expanded form
will be 9 × or 0 × (the ‘ ’ denotes a place value). This means each
term will be a multiple of 9, for example,
99009 = 9 × 10000 + 9 × 1000 + 0 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 9 × 1.
But this shortcut alone cannot identify all the multiples
of 9. Unlike the numbers 2, 5, and 10, we cannot identify
the multiples of 9 by just looking at the unit’s digit. 99 and
109 are two numbers with 9 as the units digit; but 99 is
divisible by 9, while 109 is not.

Is 10 divisible by 9? If not, what is the remainder?
Check the divisibility of other multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30, ...) by 9.
You will notice that for any multiple of 10, the remainder is the same
as the number of tens.
Similarly, look at the remainder when the multiples of 100 (100, 200,
300, … ) are divided by 9. What do you notice?
The remainder is the same as the number of hundreds for any multiple
of 100.
Using this observation, find the remainder when 427 is divided by 9.

We see that 427 has 4 hundreds; thus, its corresponding remainder
(upon division by 9) would be 4. 427 has 2 tens, and its corresponding
remainder would be 2. We have 7 units also remaining. Adding all the
remainders, we get 4 + 2 + 7 = 13. We can make one more group of 9 with
13, leaving a remainder of 4. Therefore, 427 ÷ 9 gives a remainder of 4.

You can see that this is true for any place value:

1=0+1

10 = 9 + 1
1
100 = 99 + 1
99
9 1
1000 = 999 + 1
10000 = 9999 + 1, and so on. Each digit thus denotes the remainder when
the corresponding place value is divided by 9.
For example, to find the remainder of 7309 when divided by 9, we can
just add all the digits — 7 + 3 + 0 + 9 — to get 19. This can be seen as
follows:
7 × 1000

So, we need to just

(i.e., 7 + 3 + 9 = 19)

7 × 1000 + 3 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 9 × 1
= 7 × (999 + 1) + 3 × (99 + 1) + 0 × (9 + 1) + 9 × (0+1)
= (7 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 0 × 9 + 9 × 0) + (7 × 1 + 3 × 1 + 0 × 1 + 9 × 1)
= (7 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 0 × 9 + 9 × 0) + (7 + 3 + 0 + 9).
This is a multiple of 9

So, we need to just consider this part

This means that the number 7309 is 19 more than some multiple of 9.
The digits 1 and 9 can further be added to get 1 + 9 = 10. Now, we can say
that 7309 is 10 more than a multiple of 9. And repeating this step for the
number 10, we get the remainder to be 1 + 0 = 1, meaning 7309 is 1 more
than a multiple of 9. Therefore, 7309 ÷ 9 gives a remainder of 1.
A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible
by 9. Also, we can add the digits of a number repeatedly till a single
digit is obtained. This single digit is the remainder when the number is
divided by 9.
Look at each of the following statements. Which are correct and why?
(i)

If a number is divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits is
divisible by 9.

125

(ii) If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 9, then the
number is divisible by 9.
(iii)

If a number is not divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits is
not divisible by 9.

(iv) If the sum of the digits of a number is not divisible by 9, then
the number is not divisible by 9.
Learning maths is not just about knowing some shortcuts and
following procedures but about understanding ‘why’ something
works.

3. Find the multiple of 9 that is closest to the number 6000.
4. How many multiples of 9 are there between the numbers 4300 and

A Shortcut for Divisibility by 3
We know that all the multiples of 9 are also multiples of 3. That is, if a
number is divisible by 9, it will also be divisible by 3. However, there are
other multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 9 for example — 15, 33,
and 87.
The shortcut to find the divisibility by 3 is similar to the method for 9.
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Explore
the remainders when powers of 10 are divided by 3. Explain why this
method works.

remainders with place value. Let us see how.

This alternating pattern of one more than 11 and one less than 11
continues for higher place values.
Since 400 contains 4 hundreds, 400 is 4 more than a multiple of

i.e., 2 = (0 + 2).

How about checking divisibility by 24? Will checking the divisibility by
its factors, 4 and 6, work? Why or why not?
Determining divisibility by 24 by checking divisibility by 4 and by 6
does not work. For example, the number 12 is divisible by both 4 and 6,
but not by 24.
To check for the divisibility by 24, we can instead check for the
divisibility by 3 and divisibility by 8.
Explain using prime factorisation why checking divisibility by 3 and
8 works for checking divisibility by 24, but checking divisibility by 4 and
6 is not sufÏcient for checking divisibility by 24.
There are such shortcuts to check divisibility by every number until

these work after learning certain concepts in higher grades.

I know that 10 × 8 = 80. But the units digits of 10 and

reason PQ cannot be 11 as P and Q correspond to
different digits. 12 × 8 = 96 fits all the conditions”. Can
PQ be 13? Think.
It is not possible because 13 × 8 = 104. For all 2-digit
numbers greater than 12, the product with 8 is a 3-digit number.

SUMMARY


134

We explored and learnt various properties of divisibility—
•

If a is divisible by b, then all multiples of a are divisible by b.

•

If a is divisible by b, then a is divisible by all the factors of b.

•

If a divides m and a divides n, then a divides m + n and m – n.

•

If a is divisible by b and is also divisible by c, then a is divisible by
the LCM of b and c.



We learnt shortcuts to check divisibility by 3, 9 and 11, and why they
work.



Through all this we were exposed to the power of mathematical
thinking and reasoning, using algebra, visualisation, examples and
counterexamples.

Navakankari
Navakankari, also known as Sālu Mane Āṭa, Chār-Pār, or Navkakri, is a
traditional Indian board game that is the same as ‛Nine Men’s Morris’ or
‛Mills in the West’. It is a strategy game for two players where the goal is
to form lines of three pawns to eliminate the opponent’s pawns or block
their movement.

Gameplay
1. Each player starts with 9 pawns. The players take turns in placing
their pawns on the marked intersections. An intersection can have
at most one pawn.
2. Once all the pawns are placed, the players take turns to move one of
their pawns to adjacent empty intersections to form lines of three.
The line can be horizontal or vertical.
3. Once a player makes a line with their pawns they can remove any
one of the opponent’s pawns as long as it is not a part of one of their
lines.
A player wins if the opponent has less than 3 pawns or is unable to make
a move.

MULTIPLY

We have seen how algebra makes use of letter symbols to write general
statements about patterns and relations in a compact manner. Algebra
can also be used to justify or prove claims and conjectures (like the many
properties you saw in the previous chapter) and to solve problems of
various kinds.
Distributivity is a property relating multiplication and addition that
is captured concisely using algebra. In this chapter, we explore different
types of multiplication patterns and show how they can be described in
the language of algebra by making use of distributivity.

6.1 Some Properties of Multiplication
Increments in Products
Consider the multiplication of two numbers, say, 23 × 27.
1. By how much does the product increase if the first number (23) is
increased by 1?
2. What if the second number (27) is increased by 1?
3. How about when both numbers are increased by 1?
Do you see a pattern that could help generalise our observations to the
product of any two numbers?
Let us first consider a simpler problem — find the increase in the
product when 27 is increased by 1. From the definition of multiplication
(and the commutative property), it is clear that the product increases by
23. This can be seen from the distributive property of multiplication as
well. If a, b and c are three numbers, then —

a (b + c) = ab + ac

This property can be visualised nicely using a diagram:

a (b + c)
This is called the distributive property of multiplication over
addition. Using the identity a (b + c) = ab + ac with a = 23, b = 27, and
c = 1, we have
23 ( 27 + 1) = 23 × 27 + 23
Increase

Remember that here, a (b + c) and 23 (27 + 1) mean a × (b + c), and
23 × (27 + 1), respectively. We usually skip writing the ‘×’ symbol before
or after brackets, just as in the case of expressions like 5a, xy, etc.
We can also similarly expand (a + b) c using the distributive property
as follows —
(a + b) c = c (a + b) (commutativity of multiplication)
= ca + cb (distributivity)
= ac + bc (commutativity of multiplication)
We can use the distributive property to find, in general, how much a
product increases if one or both the numbers in the product are increased
by 1. Suppose the initial two numbers are a and b. If one of the numbers,
say b, is increased by 1, then we have —
a ( b + 1) = ab × a
Increase

Now let us see what happens if both numbers in a product are
increased by 1. If in a product ab, both a and b are increased by 1, then
we obtain (a + 1) (b + 1).

137

How do we expand this?
Let us consider (a + 1) as a single term. Then, by the distributive
property, we have
(a + 1) (b + 1) = (a + 1) b + (a + 1) 1
Again applying the distributive
property, we obtain
(a + 1) (b + 1) = (a + 1) b + (a + 1) 1
= ab + (b + a + 1)

If a = 23, and, b = 27, we get

(23 + 1) (27 + 1) = (23 + 1) 27 + (23 + 1) 1
= 23 × 27 + (27 + 23 + 1)
Increase

Increase

Thus, the product ab increases by a + b + 1 when each of a and b are
increased by 1.
What would we get if we had expanded (a + 1) (b + 1) by first taking (b + 1)
as a single term? Try it?
What happens when one of the numbers in a product is increased by 1
and the other is decreased by 1? Will there be any change in the product?
Let us again take the product ab of two numbers a and b. If a is
increased by 1 and b is decreased by 1, then their product will be (a + 1)
(b – 1). Expanding this, we get
(a + 1) (b – 1) = (a + 1) b – (a + 1) 1
= ab + b – (a + 1)
= ab + b – a – 1

If a = 23, and b = 27, we get
(23 + 1) (27 – 1) = (23 + 1) 27 – (23 + 1) 1
= 23 × 27 + 27 – (23 + 1)
= 23 × 27 + 27 – 23 – 1

Increase

Increase

Will the product always increase? Find 3 examples where the product
decreases.
What happens when a and b are negative integers?
Check by substituting different values for a and b in each of the above
cases. For example, a = –5, b = 8; a = –4, b = –5; etc.
We have seen that integers also satisfy the distributive property, that
is, if x, y and z are any three integers, then x (y + z) = xy + xz.
Thus, the expressions we have for increase of products hold when the
letter-numbers take on negative integer values as well.
Recall that two algebraic expressions are equal if they take on the
same values when their letter-numbers are replaced by numbers. These

138

We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply

numbers could be any integers. Mathematical statements that express
the equality of two algebraic expressions, such as
a (b + 8) = ab + 8a,
(a + 1) (b – 1) = ab + b – a – 1, etc.,
are called identities.
By how much will the product of two numbers change if one of the
numbers is increased by m and the other by n?
If a and b are the initial numbers being multiplied, they become
a + m and b + n.
(a + m) (b + n) = (a + m)b + (a + m)n
= ab + mb + an + mn
The increase is an + bm + mn.
Notice that the product is the sum of the product of each term of
(a + m) with each term of (b + n).

(a + m) (b + n) = ab + mb + an + mn

This identity can be used to find how products change when the numbers
being multiplied are increased or decreased by any amount. Can you see
how this identity can be used when one or both numbers are decreased?
For example, let us reconsider the case when one number is increased
by 1 and the other decreased by 1. Let us write the product (a + 1) (b – 1)
as (a + 1) (b + (–1). Taking m = 1 and n = –1 in Identity 1, we have
ab + (1) × b + a × (–1) + (1) × (–1) = ab + b – a – 1,
which is the same expression that we obtain earlier.
Use Identity 1 to find how the product changes when
(i) one number is decreased by 2 and the other increased by 3;
(ii) both numbers are decreased, one by 3 and the other by 4.
Verify the answers by finding the products without converting the
subtractions to additions.
Generalising this, we can find the product (a + u) (b – v) as follows.
(a + u) (b – v) = (a + u) b – (a + u) v
= ab + ub – (av + uv)
= ab + ub – av – uv.
Check that this is the same as taking m = u and n = –v in Identity 1.
As in Identity 1, the product (a + u) (b – v) is the sum of the product of
each term of a + u (a and u) with each term of b – v (b and (–v)). Notice
that the signs of the terms in the products can be determined using the
usual rules of integer multiplication.
See how the rules of integer multiplication allows us to handle
multiple cases using a single identity!
Expand (i) (a – u) (b + v), (ii) (a – u) (b – v).
We get
(a – u) (b + v) = ab – ub + av – uv, and
(a – u) (b – v) = ab – ub – av + uv.
The distributive property is not restricted to two terms within a bracket.
1
Example 1: Expand 3a
2 (a – b + 5).
3a
1
3a
3a
3a 1
2 (a – b + 5) = ( 2 × a) – ( 2 × b) + ( 2 × 5 ).

The terms can be simplified as follows —
3a
3
2 × a = 2 × (a × a).

140

We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply

Using exponent notation, we can write 32 × (a × a) = 32 a2.
3a
3
3
2 × b = 2 × (a × b) = 2 ab.
3a 1
3 1
3
2 × 5 = (2 × 5) a = 10 a

So we get
3a
1
3 2 3
3
2 (a – b + 5) = 2 a – 2 ab + 10 a.

Can any two terms be added to get a single term?
3
For example, can 32 a2 and 10
a be added to get a single term?

We see that no two terms have exactly the same letter-numbers,
which would have allowed them to be simplified into a single term. So,
a further simplification of the expression is not possible.
Recall that we call terms having the same letter-numbers like terms.
Example 2: Expand (a + b) (a + b).
We have (a + b) (a + b) = (a+b) a + (a + b)b = a × a + b × a + ab + b × b
= a2 + ba + ab + b2
Since ba = ab, we have two terms having the same letter-numbers ab
(or, that are like terms), and so can be added —
ba + ab = ab + ab = 2ab
So we get
(a + b) (a + b) = a2 + 2ab + b2.
Example 3: Expand (a + b) (a2 + 2ab + b2).
(a + b) (a2 + 2ab + b2) = (a + b)a2 + (a + b) × 2ab + (a + b)b2
= (a × a2) + ba2 + (a × 2ab) + (b × 2ab) + ab2 + (b × b2)
The terms can be simplified as follows —
a × a2 = a3 (why?)
ba2 = a2b
a × 2ab = 2 × a × a × b = 2a2b
b × 2ab = 2 × a × b × b = 2ab2
b × b2 = b3
So, (a + b)(a2 + 2ab + b2) = a3 + a2b + 2a2b + 2ab2 + ab2 + b3.
We see that a2b and 2a2b have the same letter-numbers (or, are like
terms) and so can be added —

141

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

a2b + 2a2b = (1 + 2) a2 b = 3a2 b.
Similarly, ab2 and 2ab2 are like terms and so can be added —
ab2 + 2ab2 = (1 + 2)ab2 = 3ab2.
Thus, we have
(a + b) × (a2 + 2ab +b2 ) = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3.
A Pinch of History
The distributive property of multiplication over addition was implicit
in the calculations of mathematicians in many ancient civilisations,
particularly in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, China, and India. For
example, the mathematicians Euclid (in geometric form) and Āryabhaṭa
(in algebraic form) used the distributive law in an implicit manner
extensively in their mathematical and scientific works. The first explicit
statement of the distributive property was given by Brahmagupta in his
work Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta (Verse 12.55), who referred to the use of
the property for multiplication as khaṇḍa-guṇanam (multiplication by
parts). His verse states, “The multiplier is broken up into two or more
parts whose sum is equal to it; the multiplicand is then multiplied by
each of these and the results added”. That is, if there are two parts, then
using letter symbols this is equivalent to the identity (a + b) c = ac + bc. In
the next verse (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta further describes a method
for doing fast multiplication using this distributive property, which we
explore further in the next section.

Such methods of applying the distributive property to easily multiply
two numbers were discussed extensively in the ancient
mathematical works of Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya
(750 CE) and Bhaskaracharya (Lilavati, 1150 CE). In his work
Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta refers to such
methods for fast multiplication using the distributive property as
ista-gunana.

6.2 Special Cases of the Distributive Property
Square of the Sum/Difference of Two Numbers
The area of a square of sidelength 60 units is 3600 sq. units (602) and that
of a square of sidelength 5 units is 25 sq. units (52). Can we use this to
find the area of a square of sidelength 65 units?
A square of sidelength 65 can be split into 4 regions as shown in the
figure — a square of sidelength 60, a square of sidelength 5, and two
rectangles of sidelengths 60 and 5. The area of the square of sidelength 65
is the sum of the areas of all its constituent parts. Can you find the areas
60
of the four parts in the figure above?
We get
652 = (60 + 5)2 = 602 + 52 + 2 × (60 × 5).
= 3600 + 25 + 600 = 4225 sq. units.
Let us multiply (60 + 5) × (60 + 5) using the

= (6x)2 + 2 (6x × 5) + 52

If you have difÏculty remembering or using the general rule, you
can just apply the distributive property to multiply and get the
desired result.

Can we use 602 (=3600) and 52 (=25) to find the value of (60 – 5)2 or 552?
Let us approach this through geometry by drawing a square of side

Area of a square of sidelength 55 is (60 – 5)2 = 552.

the square of sidelength
60 and removing the areas
of the two rectangles of
sidelengths 60 and 5, i.e.,
602 – (60 × 5) – (5 × 60).
By doing this, we remove the
area of the small square of
sidelength 5 twice. What can
we do with this expression to
get the actual area?
We can add back the area
of the square of sidelength 5
to this expression. That way,
we are only subtracting this
area once.

So,
(60 – 5)2 = 602 – (60 × 5) – (5 × 60) + 52
= 3600 – 300 – 300 + 25
= 3025.
The area of the square of sidelength 55 is 3025 sq. units.
We have seen what (a + b)2 gives when expanded. What is the
expansion of (a – b)2?
Using the distributive property,
(a – b)2 = (a – b) × (a – b)
= (a)2 – ba – ab + (b)2
= a2 – 2ab + b2.
We can also use the expansion of (a + b)2 to find the expansion of
(a – b)2. Think how.
Hint: (a – b)2 = (a + (–b))2.
We can now directly use the expansion of (a + b)2.

Take a pair of natural numbers. Calculate the sum of their squares.
Can you write twice this sum as a sum of two squares?
Try this with other pairs of numbers. Have you figured out a pattern?
Notice that 2 (52 + 62) = (6 + 5)2 + (6 – 5)2.
Do the identities below help in explaining the observed pattern?
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
(a – b)2 = a2 – 2ab + b2
(a + b)2 + (a – b)2 = (a2 + 2ab + b2) + (a2 – 2ab + b2)
Adding the like terms a2 + a2 = 2a2 , b2 + b2 = 2b2 and 2ab – 2ab = 0,
we get
2 (a2 + b2) = (a + b)2 + (a – b)2.

The pattern here appears to be a2 – b2 = (a + b) × (a – b).
Is this a true identity? Using the distributive property, we get
(a + b) × (a – b) = a2 – ab + ba – a2.

a2 = (a + b) (a – b) + b2
Why is this identity true?
Now, for example, 312 can be found by taking a = 31 and b = 1.
312 = (31 + 1) (31 – 1) + 12
= 32 × 30 + 1
= 961.
1972 can be found by taking a = 197, and b = 3.
1972 = (197 + 3) (197 – 3) + 32

SUMMARY
�

We extended the distributive property to find the product of
two expressions each of which has two terms. The general form
for the same is (a + b) × (c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd.

�

We saw some special cases of this identity.
y (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
y (a – b)2 = a2 – 2ab + b2
y (a + b) (a – b) = a2 – b2.

�

We considered different patterns, and explored how to
understand them using algebra. We saw that, often, there are
multiple ways to solve a problem and arrive at the same correct
answer. Finding different methods to approach and solve the
same problem is a creative process.

measuring the rectangles?

What makes images A, C, and D appear similar, and B and E different?
When we compare image A with C, we notice that the width of C is
half that of A. The height is also half of A. Both the width and height
have changed by the same factor (through multiplication), 12 in this
case. Since the widths and heights have changed by the same factor, the
images look similar.
When we compare image A with image B, we notice that the width of
B is 20 millimetre (mm) less than that of A. The height too is 20 mm less
than the height of A. Even though the difference (through subtraction) is
the same, the images look different. Have the width and height changed
by the same factor? The height of B is half the height of A. But the width of
B is not half the width of A. Since the width and height have not changed
by the same factor, the images look different.
Can you check by what factors the width and height of image D change
as compared to image A? Are the factors the same?
Images A, C, and D look similar because their widths and heights have
changed by the same factor. We say that the changes to their widths and
heights are proportional.

160

Proportional Reasoning-1

7.2 Ratios
We use the notion of a ratio to represent such proportional relationships
in mathematics.
We can say that the ratio of width to height of image A is
60 : 40.
The numbers 60 and 40 are called the terms of the ratio.
The ratio of width to height of image C is 30 : 20, and that of image D
is 90 : 60.
In a ratio of the form a : b, we can say that for every ‘a’ units of the
first quantity, there are ‘b’ units of the second quantity.
So, in image A, we can say that for every 60 mm of width, there are 40
mm of height.
We can say that the ratios of width to height of images A, C, and D
are proportional because the terms of these ratios change by the same
factor. Let us see how.
Image A — 60 : 40
Multiplying both the terms by 12, we get
60 × 12 : 40 × 12
which is 30 : 20, the ratio of width to height in image C.
By what factor should we multiply the ratio 60 : 40 (image A) to get 90 : 60
(image D)?
A more systematic way to compare whether the ratios are proportional
is to reduce them to their simplest form and see if these simplest forms
are the same.

7.3 Ratios in their Simplest Form
We can reduce ratios to their simplest form by dividing the terms by
their HCF.
In image A, the terms are 60 and 40. What is the HCF of 60 and 40? It
is 20. Dividing the terms by 20, we get the ratio of image A to be 3 : 2 in
its simplest form.
The ratio of image D is 90 : 60. Dividing both terms by 30 (HCF
of 90 and 60), we get the simplest form to be 3 : 2. So the ratios of
images A and D are proportional as well.
What is the simplest form of the ratios of images B and E?
The ratio of image B is 40 : 20; in its simplest form, it is 2 : 1.
The ratio of image E is 60 : 60; in its simplest form, it is 1 : 1.

161

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

These ratios are not the same as 3 : 2. So, we can say that the ratios of
width to height of images B and E are not proportional to the ratios of
images A, C, and D.
When two ratios are the same in their simplest forms, we say that the
ratios are in proportion, or that the ratios are proportional. We use
the ‘::’ symbol to indicate that they are proportional.
So a : b :: c : d indicates that the ratios a : b and c : d are proportional.
Thus,
60 : 40 :: 30 : 20 and 60 : 40 :: 90 : 60.

7.4 Problem Solving with Proportional Reasoning
Example 1: Are the ratios 3 : 4 and 72 : 96 proportional?
3 : 4 is already in its simplest form.
To find the simplest form of 72 : 96, we need to divide both terms by
their HCF.
What is the HCF of 72 and 96?
The HCF of 72 and 96 is 24. Dividing both terms by 24, we get 3 : 4.
Since both ratios in their simplest form are the same, they are proportional.
Example 2: Kesang wanted to make lemonade for a celebration. She
made 6 glasses of lemonade in a vessel and added 10 spoons of sugar to
the drink. Her father expected more people to join the celebration. So he
asked her to make 18 more glasses of lemonade.
To make the lemonade with the same sweetness, how many spoons of
sugar should she add?
To maintain the same sweetness, the ratio of
the number of glasses of lemonade to the number
of spoons of sugar should be proportional. For 6
glasses of lemonade, she added 10 spoons of sugar.
The ratio of glasses of lemonade to spoons of
sugar is 6 : 10. If she needs to make 18 more glasses
of lemonade, how many spoons of sugar should
she use? We can model this problem as —
6 : 10 :: 18 : ?
We know that each term in the ratio must change
by the same factor, for the ratios to be proportional.
How can we find the factor of change in the ratio?
The first term has increased from 6 to 18. To find the factor of change,
we can divide 18 by 6 to get 3.

162
##7##
Proportional Reasoning-1

The second term should also change by the same factor. When 10
increases by a factor of 3, it becomes 30. Thus,
6 : 10 :: 18 : 30.
So, she should use 30 spoons of sugar to make 18 glasses of lemonade
with the same sweetness as earlier.
Example 3: Nitin and Hari were constructing a compound wall around
their house. Nitin was building the longer side, 60 ft in length, and Hari was
building the shorter side, 40 ft in length. Nitin used 3 bags of cement but
Hari used only 2 bags of cement. Nitin was worried that the wall Hari built
would not be as strong as the wall he built because she used less cement.
Is Nitin correct in his thinking?
In Nitin and Hari’s case, we should compare the ratio of the length
of the wall to the bags of cement used by each of them and see whether
they are proportional.
The ratio in Nitin’s case is 60 : 3, i.e., 20 : 1 (in its simplest form).
The ratio in Hari’s case is 40 : 2, i.e., 20 : 1 (in its simplest form).
Since both ratios are proportional, the walls are equally strong. Nitin
should not worry!
Example 4: In my school, there are 5 teachers and 170 students. The
ratio of teachers to students in my school is 5 : 170. Count the number
of teachers and students in your school. What is the ratio of teachers to
students in your school? Write it below.

Note to the Teacher: Give more such examples that students can relate to and ask
them to give reasons why they think they are correct. Engaging with these problems
and finding solutions through a process of proportional reasoning should go along
with learning procedures and methods to solve the problems.

Example 6: When Neelima was 3 years old, her mother’s age was 10
times her age. What is the ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age?
What would be the ratio of their ages when Neelima is 12 years old?
Would it remain the same?
The ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age when Neelima is 3 years
old is 3 : 30 (her mother’s age is 10 times Neelima’s age). In the simplest
form, it is 1 : 10.
When Neelima is 12 years old (i.e., 9 years later), the ratio of their ages
will be 12 : 39 (9 years later, her mother would be 39 years old). In the
simplest form, it is 4 : 13.
When we add (or subtract) the same number from the terms of a ratio,
the ratio changes and is not necessarily proportional to the original ratio.
Example 7: Fill in the missing numbers for the following ratios that are
proportional to 14 : 21.
______ : 42

6 : ______

2 : ______

In the first ratio, we don’t know the first term. But the
second term is 42. It is 2 times the second term of the
ratio 14 : 21. So, the first term should also be 2 times 14
(the first term). Hence the proportional ratio is 28 : 42.
For the second ratio, the first term is 6.
What factor should we multiply 14 by to get 6? Can it
be an integer? Or should it be a fraction?

14:21
×2

× 2=?
______ :42

We can model this as 14y = 6. So, y = 6 = 3 .
14

7

So, we need to multiply 21 (the second term of 14 : 21) also by the
same factor 3.
7
3
21 × is 9. So, the ratio is 6 : 9.
7

In the third ratio, the first term is 2.
We can see that when we divide 14 (the first term of 14 : 21) by 7
(HCF of 14 and 21) we get 2.
If we divide 21 also by 7, we get 3. So, the ratio is 2 : 3.
Filter Coffee!
Filter coffee is a beverage made by mixing coffee
decoction with milk. Manjunath usually mixes 15
mL of coffee decoction with 35 mL of milk to make
one cup of filter coffee in his coffee shop.
In this case, we can say that the ratio of coffee
decoction to milk is 15 : 35.
If customers want ‘stronger’ filter coffee,
Manjunath mixes 20 mL of decoction with 30 mL of
milk. The ratio here is 20 : 30.

Trairasika — The Rule of Three
Example 8: For the mid-day meal in a school with 120 students, the cook
usually makes 15 kg of rice. On a rainy day, only 80 students came to
school. How many kilograms of rice should the cook make so that the
food is not wasted?
The ratio of the number of students to the amount of rice needs to be
proportional.
So, 120 : 15 :: 80 : ?
What is the factor of change in the first term?
80
We can find that by dividing the terms 120
= 23.

The number of students is reduced by a factor of 23 .
On multiplying the weight of rice by the same factor, we get,
15 × 23 = 10.
So, the cook should make 10 kg of rice on that day.
The situation above is a typical example of a problem where we need
to use proportional reasoning to find a solution. Four quantities are

167

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

linked proportionally, out of which three are known and we must find
the fourth, unknown, quantity.
To solve such problems, we can model two proportional ratios using
algebraic notation as —
a : b :: c : d.
For these two ratios to be proportional, we know that term c should
be a multiple of term a by a factor, say f, and term d should be a multiple
of term b by the same factor f. So,
c = fa

...(1)

d = fb

...(2)

From (1) and (2), we can say that,
c
d
f = a and f = .
b
c d
Therefore, a = .
b
Multiplying both sides by ab, we get,
c
d
ab × a = ab ×
b
c
d
ab × a = ab ×
b
bc = ad or ad = bc
Thus, when a : b :: c : d, then ad = bc. This is known as cross multiplication
of terms.
Since ad = bc, we can show that
bc
d= a .
Two ratios are proportional if their terms are equal when cross
multiplied. The fourth unknown quantity can be found through such
cross multiplication.
In ancient India, Āryabhaṭa (199 CE) and others called such problems
of proportionality Rule of Three problems. There were 3 numbers
given — the pramāṇa (measure — ‘a’ in our case), the phala (fruit — ‘b’
in our case), and the ichchhā (requisition — ‘c’ in our case). To find the
ichchhāphala (yield — ‘d’ in our case), Āryabhaṭa says,
“Multiply the phala by the ichchhā and divide the resulting product
by the pramāṇa.”
In other words, Āryabhaṭa says,
“pramāṇa : phala :: ichchhā : ichchhāphala,” therefore,
pramāṇa × ichchhāphala = phala × ichchhā.

168

Proportional Reasoning-1

Thus,
ichchhāphala =

phala × ichchhā
.
pramāṇa

Using the cross multiplication method proposed by Āryabhaṭa, ancient
Indians solved complex problems that involved proportionality.
Example 9: A car travels 90 km in 150 minutes. If it continues at the
same speed, what distance will it cover in 4 hours?
If it continues at the same speed, the ratio of the time taken should be
proportional to the ratio of the distance covered.
150 : 90 :: 4 : ?
Is this the right way to formulate the question?
No, because 150 is in minutes, but 4 is in hours. The second ratio
should use the same units for time as the first ratio. Since 4 hours is 240
minutes, the right form is
150 : 90 :: 240 : ?
How can you find the distance covered in 240 minutes?
Discuss with your classmates and find the answer using different
strategies.
Note to the Teacher: Instead of giving one ‘method’ to solve the problem of the
distance, encourage students to reason out the answer through different strategies.
They can use their understanding of equivalent fractions and equivalent ratios to
find the answer.

We can model this proportion as
150 : 90 :: 240 : x.
By cross multiplication, we get
150 × x = 240 × 90
Therefore,

x = 240 × 90 .

Example 10: A small farmer in Himachal Pradesh sells each 200 g packet
of tea for ₹200. A large estate in Meghalaya sells each 1 kg packet of
tea for ₹800. Are the weight-to-price ratios in both places proportional?
Which tea is more expensive?

169

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

The ratio of weight to price of the Himachal tea is 200 : 200.
What is the weight to price ratio of the Meghalaya tea? Is it 1 : 800?
This would not be appropriate, because we considered the weight in
grams in the case of Himachal. So, the weight to price ratio is 1000 : 800
in Meghalaya after we convert the weight to grams.
To check if the ratios are proportional, we need to see if both ratios
are the same in their simplest forms.
The Himachal tea ratio in its simplest form is 1 : 1.
The Meghalaya tea ratio in its simplest form is 5 : 4.
So, the ratios are not proportional.
Which tea is more expensive? Why?
Note to the Teacher: Encourage a discussion on the more expensive tea, how they
came to their conclusions and what the reasons for that tea being more expensive
could be.

To answer the question as to which tea is more expensive, we should
compare the price of tea for the same weight in both places.
What is the price of 1 kg of tea from Meghalaya? It is ₹800.
In Himachal, if 200 g of tea costs rupees 200, what is the cost of 1 kg
of tea?
Let us say that the price of 1 kg of tea is x rupees. 200 g is 15 of 1 kg.
1
So,
5 × x = 200.
Multiplying both sides by 5, we get
1
5 × x × 5 = 200 × 5
1
× x × 5 = 1000
5

x = 1000.
So, the cost of 1 kg of tea is ₹800 in Meghalaya and ₹1,000 in Himachal
Pradesh.
Therefore, the tea from Himachal Pradesh is more expensive.

Would it take Puneeth’s father more time or less time to reach
Kanpur? Think about it.
Even though this problem looks similar to the previous
problems, it cannot be solved using the Rule of Three!
The time of travel would actually decrease when the speed

Let us compare the ratios for the sample table above.
The ratio of the volume of a sachet to a small bottle is 6 : 180. The ratio
of their prices is 2 : 154. Are these ratios proportional?
Why do you think that the ratio of the prices is not proportional to
the ratio of the volumes?

Note to the Teacher: Give a project to students. Start by dividing the class into
groups. Each group should go to one shop and collect prices for different measures
of the same product. For example, they should note down the prices of 500 g of
rice, 1 kg of rice, and 10 kg of rice. They should make tables with measure sizes and
prices, and present them to the rest of the class. They should discuss if the prices are
proportional or not, and why.

7.5 Sharing, but Not Equally!
Activity 3: Form a pair. Collect 12
countable objects or counters (it can
be coins, seeds, or pebbles). Now,
share them between the two of you
in different ways.
If you divide them equally, what is
the ratio of the number of counters
with each of you?
Each of you will get 6 counters.
So, the ratio is 6 : 6, or 1 : 1 in its
simplest form.
Now let us not share equally.
If your partner gets 5 counters, how
many objects will you get? What is
the ratio of the counters?

172

Proportional Reasoning-1

The ratio of the counters of your partner to yours is 5 : 7.
Now, if you want to share the counters between the two of you in the
ratio of 3 : 1, how many counters would each of you get?
Share the counters in different ways and see which combination is in
the ratio 3 : 1.
One way to share the counters in the ratio of 3 : 1 is as follows —
1. Your partner takes 3 counters and you take 1 counter. There are now
8 counters left.
2. Your partner takes 3 more counters and you take 1 more counter.
There are now 4 counters left.
3. Your partner takes 3 more counters and you take 1 more counter.
There are no more counters left.
So, your partner gets 9 counters in total and you get 3 counters.
When we divide 12 counters in the ratio of 3 : 1 between two people,
one gets 9 counters and the other gets 3 counters.
The ‛whole’ is 12

Now, if you want to share 42 counters between the two of you in the
ratio of 4 : 3, how will you do it?
Using the same procedure would take a long time! There is a simpler
way to share the whole with parts in a specified ratio.
You need to divide 42 into groups such that your partner gets 4 groups
and you get 3 groups.
What is the size of each group?
If your partner gets 4 groups and you get 3 groups, the total number
of groups is 7. So, the size of each group is 42 ÷ 7 = 6.
Multiplying the number of groups by the size of each group, your
partner gets 24 counters and you get 18 counters, when you share 42
counters in the ratio of 4 : 3.

In general, when we want to divide a quantity, say x, in the ratio m : n,
we do the following:
1. We need to split x into groups such that it can be divided into two
parts where the first part has m groups and the second part has
n groups.
2. But what is the size of each group? This can be found out by dividing
x by the number of groups. The number of groups are m + n. So, the
size of each group is m x+ n .
3. So, the first part has m × m x+ n objects and the second part has n × x
m+n
objects.
Thus, if we want to divide a quantity x in the ratio of m: n, then the
parts will be m × m x+ n and n × x . We see that

Example 11: Prashanti and Bhuvan started a food cart business near
their school. Prashanti invested ₹75,000 and Bhuvan invested ₹25,000.
At the end of the first month, they gained a profit of ₹4,000. They
decided that they would share the profit in the same ratio as that of their
investment. What is each person’s share of the profit?
The ratio of their investment is 75000 : 25000.
Reducing this ratio to its simplest form, we get 3 : 1.
3 + 1 is 4 and dividing the profit of 4000 by 4, we get 1000.
So, Prashanti’s share is 3 × 1000 and Bhuvan’s share is 1 × 1000.
So, Prashanti would get ₹3,000 and Bhuvan would get ₹1,000 of the profit.

Example 12: A mixture of 40 kg contains sand and cement in the ratio
of 3 : 1. How much cement should be added to the mixture to make the
ratio of sand to cement 5 : 2?

Let us find the quantity of sand and cement in the original mixture.
The ratio is 3 : 1 and the total weight is 40 kg.
3
40 = 30 kg.
(3 + 1) ×
The weight of cement is 1 × 40 = 10 kg.
(3 + 1)

So, the weight of sand is

The weight of sand is the same in the new mixture. It remains 30. But
the new ratio of sand to cement is 5 : 2. So the question is,
5 : 2 :: 30 : ?
If the ratio is 5 : 2, then the second term is 25 times the first term. Since
the new ratio is equivalent to 5 : 2, the second term in the new ratio
should also be 25 times of 30.
2 30 = 12.
5×

The new mixture should have 12 kg of cement if the ratio of sand to
cement is to be 5 : 2.
There is 10 kg of cement already. So, we need to add 2 kg of cement to
the original mixture.

7.6 Unit Conversions
We have noticed earlier that solving problems with proportionality
often requires us to convert units from one system to another. Here are

175

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

a few important unit conversions for your reference.
Length
1 metre = 3.281 feet
Area
1 square metre = 10.764 square feet
1 acre = 43,560 square feet
1 hectare = 10,000 square metres
1 hectare = 2.471 acres
Volume
1 millilitre (mL) = 1 cubic centimetre (cc)
1 litre = 1,000 mL or 1,000 cc
Temperature
Temperature conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius is a bit more
complicated. 0oC = 32 oF, and
Fahrenheit = 95 × Celsius + 32
and
Celsius = 59 × (Fahrenheit–32)
For example, 25 oC is 77 oF.
