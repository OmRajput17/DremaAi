CONSTITUTION:
WHY AND HOW?

INTRODUCTION

This book is about the working of the Indian Constitution. In the chapters that
follow, you will read information about various aspects of the working of our
Constitution. You will learn about the various institutions of the government in
our country and their relationship with each other.

But before you begin to read about elections, governments, and presidents
and prime ministers, it is necessary to understand that the entire structure of the
government and the various principles that bind the institutions of government
have their origin in the Constitution of India.

After studying this chapter, you  will learn:
± what a constitution means;
± what a constitution does to the society;
± how constitutions govern the allocation of power in society; and
± what was the way in which the Constitution of India was made.

WHY DO WE NEED A CONSTITUTION?
What is a constitution? What are its functions? What role does it
perform for a society? How does a constitution relate to our daily
existence? Answering these questions is not as difficult as you might
think.

Constitution allows coordination and
assurance
Imagine yourself to be a member of a
reasonably large group. Further imagine that
this group has the following characteristics.
The members of this group are diverse in
various ways. They have different religious
allegiances: some are Hindus, some are
Muslims, some Christians and some perhaps
profess no religion at all. They are also varied

in many different respects: they
pursue different professions, have
different abilities, have different
hobbies, different tastes in
everything from films to books. This group is very much like the

Some are old, some young.
Imagine further that members of this group are likely to
have disputes over various aspects of life: How much
property should one be allowed to own?  Should it be
compulsory that every child be sent to school or should

village or town or colony too? more parks instead? Should the group be allowed to
discriminate against some of its members?  Every question
will elicit a variety of answers from different people. But,

for all their diversity, this group has to live together. They are
dependent upon each other in various ways. They require the

2 cooperation of each other. What will enable the group to live together
peacefully?

Chapter 1: Constitution: Why and How?

One may say that perhaps members of this group can live together
if they can agree on some basic rules. Why will the group need certain 3
basic rules? Think of what would happen in the absence of some
basic rules. Every individual would be insecure simply because they
would not know what members of this group could do to each other,
who could claim rights over what. Any group will need some basic
rules that are publicly promulgated and known to all members of
that group to achieve a minimal degree of coordination. But these
rules must not only be known, they must also be enforceable.  If
citizens have no assurance that others will follow these rules, they
will themselves have no reason to follow these rules. Saying that the
rules are legally enforceable gives an assurance to everybody that
others will follow these, for if they do not do so, they will be punished.

The first function of a constitution is to provide a set of
basic rules that allow for minimal coordination amongst
members of a society.

Activity
Enact the thought experiment of this section in the
classroom. The entire class should discuss and arrive
at some decisions that would apply to everyone for
this entire session. The decision could be about:
± How would the class representatives be chosen?
± Which decisions will the representative be able to

take on behalf of the entire class?
± Are there some decisions that the class

representative cannot take without consulting the
entire class?

± You can add any other items to this list (collection
of common kitty for the class, organisation of picnic
and trips, sharing of common resources, …) as long
as everyone agrees to it. Make sure that you
include those subjects that have led to any
differences in the past.

± How to revise these decisions in case you
need to?

Reprint 2025-26



Indian Constitution at Work

± Write down all these decisions on a paper and put
it up on the notice board. Which problems did you
encounter in this decision? Were there differences
among different students? How did you resolve
these differences? Did the entire class gain
something from this exercise?

Specification of decision making powers
A constitution is a body of fundamental principles according to which
a state is constituted or governed. But what should these
fundamental rules be? And what makes them fundamental? Well,
the first question you will have to decide is who gets to decide what
the laws governing the society should be? You may want rule X, but
others may want rule Y. How do we decide whose rules or preferences
should govern us? You may think the rules you want everyone to
live by are the best; but others think that their rules are the best.
How do we resolve this dispute? So even before you decide what
rules should govern this group you have to decide: Who gets to
decide?

The constitution has to provide an answer to this question. It
specifies the basic allocation of power in a society. It decides who
gets to decide what the laws will be. In principle, this question, who
gets to decide, can be answered in many ways: in a monarchical
constitution, a monarch decides; in some constitutions like the old
Soviet Union, one single party was given the power to decide. But in
democratic constitutions, broadly speaking, the people get to decide.
But this matter is not so simple. Because even if you answer that the
people should decide, it will not answer the question: how should
the people decide? For something to be law, should everyone agree
to it? Should  the people directly vote on each matter as the ancient
Greeks did? Or should the people express their preferences by electing
representatives? But if the people act through their representatives,
how should these representatives be elected? How many should there
be?

4 In the Indian Constitution for example, it is specified that in most
instances, Parliament gets to decide laws and policies, and that
Parliament itself be organised in a particular manner. Before
identifying what the law in any given society is, you have to identify

on certain procedures there would be something
obviously unjust about that government enacting these
laws.

So the third function of a constitution is to set
some limits on what a government can  impose on
its citizens. These limits are fundamental in the
sense that government may never trespass them.

Constitutions limit the power of government in many
ways. The most common way of limiting the power of
government is to specify certain fundamental rights that
all of us possess as citizens and which no government
can ever be allowed to violate.  The exact content and
interpretation of these rights varies from constitution to

of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of association,
freedom to conduct a trade or business  etc. In practice,
these rights can be limited  during times of national
emergency and the constitution specifies the
circumstances under which these rights may be
withdrawn.

Aspirations and goals of a society
Most of the older constitutions limited themselves largely
to allocating decision-making power and setting some
limits to government power. But many twentieth century
constitutions, of which the Indian Constitution is the
finest example, also provide an enabling framework for
the government to do certain positive things, to express
the aspirations and goals of society. The Indian
Constitution was particularly innovative in this respect.
Societies with deep entrenched inequalities of various

6 kinds, will not only have to set limits on the power of
government, they will also have to enable and empower
the government to take positive measures to overcome
forms of inequality or deprivation.

Constitution, and these provisions are found in the section
on Fundamental Rights. The Directive Principles of State

aspirations of the people.

The fourth function of a constitution is to enable
the government to fulfil the aspirations of a society
and create conditions for a just society.

framework within which one pursues individual aspirations, goals and
freedoms. The constitution sets authoritative constraints upon what  one

THE AUTHORITY OF A CONSTITUTION
10

We have outlined some of the functions a constitution performs. These
functions explain why most societies have a constitution. But there
are three further questions we can ask about constitutions:

Reprint 2025-26



Chapter 1: Constitution: Why and How?

a) What is  a constitution?
b) How effective is a constitution? 11
c) Is  a constitution just?
In most countries, ‘Constitution’ is a compact

document that comprises a number of articles about the
state, specifying how the state is to be constituted and
what norms it should follow. When we ask for the
constitution of a country we are usually referring to this
document. But some countries, the United Kingdom for
instance, do not have one single document that can be
called the Constitution. Rather they have a series of
documents and decisions that, taken collectively, are
referred to as the constitution. So, we can say that
constitution is the document or set of documents that
seeks to perform the functions that we mentioned above.

But many constitutions around the world exist only
on paper; they are mere words existing on a parchment.
The crucial question is: how effective is a constitution?
What makes it effective? What ensures that it has a real
impact on the lives of people? Making a constitution
effective depends upon  many factors.

Mode of promulgation
This refers to how a constitution comes into being. Who
crafted the constitution and how much authority did they
have? In many countries constitutions remain defunct
because they are crafted by military leaders or leaders
who are not popular and do not have the ability to carry
the people with them. The most successful constitutions,
like India, South Africa and the United States, are
constitutions which  were created in the aftermath of
popular national movements. Although India’s

that, for instance, allowed permanent majorities to oppress minority
groups within society would give minorities no reason to go along 13
with the provision of the constitution. Or a constitution that
systematically privileged some members at the expense of others, or
that systematically entrenched the power of small groups in society,
would cease to command allegiance. If any group feels their identity
is being stifled, they will have no reason to abide by the constitution.
No constitution by itself achieves perfect justice. But it has to convince
people that it provides the framework for pursuing basic justice.

Do this thought experiment. Ask yourself this question: What
would be the content of some basic rules in society, such that they
gave everyone a reason to go along with them?

The more a constitution preserves the freedom and equality of
all its members, the more likely it is to succeed. Does the Indian
Constitution, broadly speaking, give everyone a reason to go along
with its broad outlines? After studying this book, one should be
able to answer this question in the affirmative.

Balanced institutional design
Constitutions are often subverted, not by the people, but by small
groups, who wish to enhance their own power. Well crafted
constitutions fragment power in society intelligently so that no single
group can subvert the constitution. One way of such intelligent
designing of a constitution is to ensure that no single institution
acquires monopoly of power. This is often done by fragmenting power
across different institutions. The Indian Constitution, for example,
horizontally fragments power across different institutions like the
Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary and even independent
statutory bodies like the Election Commission. This ensures that
even if one institution wants to subvert the Constitution, others can
check its transgressions. An intelligent system of checks and
balances has facilitated the success of the Indian Constitution.

Another important aspect of intelligent institutional design is:
that a constitution must strike the right balance between certain
values, norms and procedures as authoritative, and at the same
time allow enough flexibility in its operations to adapt to changing
needs and circumstances. Too rigid a constitution is likely to break
under the weight of change; a constitution that is, on the other

Successful constitutions strike the right
balance between preserving core values and
adapting them to new circumstances. You
will notice the wisdom of makers of the
Indian Constitution  in the chapter on the
Constitution as a living document (Chapter
9). The Indian Constitution is described as
‘a living’ document.  By striking a balance
between the possibility to change the
provisions and the limits on such changes,
the Constitution has ensured that it will
survive as a document respected by people.
This arrangement also ensures that no
section or group can, on its own, subvert
the Constitution.

± Also, is the constitution the locus of people’s hopes and
aspiration? The ability of the constitution to command voluntary
allegiance of the people depends to a certain extent upon whether
the constitution is just. What are the principles of justice

India on 14 August 1947. Its members were chosen by indirect election 15
by the members of the Provincial Legislative Assemblies that had been

established  under the Government of India Act, 1935. The Constituent

Assembly was composed roughly along the lines suggested by the

plan proposed by the committee of the British cabinet, known as the

Cabinet Mission.  According to this plan:

± Each Province and each Princely State or group of States were

allotted seats proportional to their respective population roughly

in the ratio of 1:10,00,000. As a result the Provinces (that were

under direct British rule) were to elect 292 members while the

Princely States were allotted a minimum of 93 seats.

± The seats in each Province were distributed among the three main

communities, Muslims, Sikhs and general, in proportion to their

respective populations.

± Members of each community in the Provincial Legislative

Assembly elected their own representatives by the method of

proportional representation with single transferable vote.

± The method of selection in the case of representatives of Princely

States was to be determined by consultation.

Indian Constitution at Work

The previous section  discusses the three factors that
make a constitution effective and respectable. How far
does the Indian Constitution pass this test?

Composition of the Constituent Assembly
As a consequence of the Partition under the plan of
3 June 1947 those members who were elected from
territories which fell under Pakistan ceased to be
members of the Constituent Assembly. The number of
members in the Assembly was reduced to 299. The
Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949. 284
members were actually present on 24 January 1950 and
appended their signature to the Constitution as finally
passed. The Constitution came into force on 26 January
1950. The Constitution was thus framed against the
backdrop of the horrendous violence that the Partition
unleashed on the subcontinent. But it is a tribute to the
fortitude of the framers that they were not only able to
draft a constitution under immense pressure, but also
learnt the right lessons from the  unimaginable violence
that accompanied the Partition. The Constitution was
committed to a new conception of citizenship, where not
only would minorities be secure, but religious identity
would have no bearing on citizenship rights.

But this account of the composition of the Constituent
Assembly that drafted the Constitution touches upon only
the surface of how our Constitution was made. Although,

Chapter 1: Constitution: Why and How?

The Principle of Deliberation
The authority of the Constituent Assembly does not come only from 17
the fact that it was broadly, though not perfectly, representative. It
comes from the procedures it adopted to frame the Constitution and
the values its members brought to their deliberations. While in any
assembly that claims to be representative, it is desirable that diverse
sections of society participate, it is equally important that they
participate not only as representatives of their own identity or
community. Each member deliberated upon the Constitution with
the interests of the whole nation in mind. There were often
disagreements amongst members, but few of these disagreements
could be traced to members protecting their own interests.

There were legitimate differences of principle. And the differences
were many: should India adopt a centralised or decentralised system
of government? What should be the relations between the States and
the centre? What should be the powers of the judiciary? Should the
Constitution protect property rights? Almost every issue that lies at
the foundation of a modern state was discussed with great
sophistication. Only one provision of the Constitution was passed
without virtually any debate: the introduction of universal suffrage
(meaning that all citizens reaching a certain age, would be entitled to
be voters irrespective of religion, caste, education, gender or income).
So, while the members felt no need at all to discuss the issue of who
should have the right to vote, every other matter was seriously
discussed and debated. Nothing can be a better testament to the
democratic commitment of this Assembly.

The Constitution drew its authority from the fact that members
of the Constituent Assembly engaged in what one might call public
reason. The members of the Assembly placed a great emphasis on
discussion and reasoned argument. They did not simply advance
their own interests, but gave principled reasons to other members
for their positions. The very act of giving reasons to others makes
you move away from simply a narrow consideration of your own
interest because you have to give reasons to others to make them go
along with your view point. The voluminous debates in the

Constituent Assembly of India could not have functioned
if there was no background consensus on the main
principles the Constitution should enshrine. These
principles were forged during the long struggle for
freedom. In a way, the Constituent Assembly was giving
concrete shape and form to the principles it had  inherited
from the nationalist movement. For decades preceding
the promulgation of the Constitution, the nationalist
movement had debated many questions that were
relevant to the making of the constitution — the shape
and form of government India should have, the values it
should uphold, the inequalities it should overcome.
Answers forged in those debates were given their final
form in the Constitution.

Perhaps the best summary of the principles that the
nationalist movement brought to the Constituent
Assembly is the Objective Resolution (the resolution that
defined the aims of the Assembly) moved by Nehru in
1946. This resolution encapsulated the aspirations and
values behind the Constitution. What the previous section
terms as substantive provisions of the constitution  is
inspired by and summed up by the values incorporated
in the Objectives Resolution. Based on this resolution,
our Constitution gave institutional expression to these

Main points of the Objectives Resolution

√ India is an independent, sovereign, republic;

√ India shall be a Union of erstwhile British Indian
territories, Indian States, and other parts outside
British India and Indian States as are willing to be a
part of the Union;

√ Territories forming the Union shall be autonomous
units and exercise all powers and functions of the
Government and administration, except those assigned
to or vested in the Union;

√ All powers and authority of sovereign and independent
India and its constitution shall flow from the people;

√ All people of India shall be guaranteed and secured
social, economic and political justice; equality of status
and opportunities and equality before law; and
fundamental freedoms - of speech, expression, belief,
faith, worship, vocation, association and action -
subject to law and public morality;

√ The minorities, backward and tribal areas, depressed
and other backward classes shall be provided adequate
safeguards;

√ The territorial integrity of the Republic and its sovereign
rights on land, sea and air shall be maintained
according to justice and law of civilized nations;

√ The land would make full and willing contribution to

the promotion of world peace and welfare of mankind.

Institutional arrangements
The third factor ensuring effectiveness of a constitution is a balanced
arrangement of the institutions of government. The basic principle is
that government must be democratic and committed to the welfare
of the people. The Constituent Assembly spent a lot of time on
evolving the right balance among the various institutions like the

20 executive, the legislature and the judiciary. This led to the
adoption of the parliamentary form and the federal arrangement,
which would distribute governmental powers between the

legislature and the executive on the one hand and
between the States and the central government on the 21
other hand.

While evolving the most balanced governmental
arrangements, the makers of our Constitution did not
hesitate to learn from experiments and experiences of
other countries. Thus, the framers of the Constitution
were not averse to borrowing from other constitutional
traditions. Indeed, it is a testament to their wide learning
that they could lay their hands upon any intellectual
argument, or historical example that was necessary for
fulfilling the task at hand. So they borrowed a number of
provisions from different countries.

But borrowing these ideas was not slavish imitation.

Conclusion 23
It is a tribute to the wisdom and foresight of the makers of the
Constitution that they presented to the nation a document that
enshrined fundamental values and highest aspirations shared
by the people. This is one of the reasons why this most intricately
crafted document has not only survived but become a living
reality, when so many other constitutions have perished with
the paper they were first written on.

India’s Constitution is a unique document which in turn
became an exemplar for many other constitutions, most notably
South Africa. The main purpose behind the long search that
went on for almost three years was to strike the right balance
so that institutions created by the Constitution would not be
haphazard or tentative arrangements but would be able to
accommodate the aspirations of the people of India for a long
time to come. You will know more about these arrangements
through the study of the remaining chapters in this book.

THE IMPORTANCE OF RIGHTS
27

In 1982 during the construction work for Asian Games the
government engaged a few contractors. These contractors employed
a large number of very poor construction workers from different
parts of the country to build the flyovers and stadiums. These workers
were kept in poor working conditions and were paid less than the
minimum wages decided by the government.

A team of social scientists studied their poor condition and
petitioned the Supreme Court. They argued that employing a person
to work for less than the minimum prescribed wage amounts to
begar or forced labour, which is a violation of the Fundamental Right
against exploitation. The court accepted this plea and directed the
government to ensure that thousands of workers get the prescribed
wages for their work.

Machal Lalung was 23 when he was arrested. A resident of
Chuburi village of Morigaon district of Assam, Machal was charged
of causing grievous injuries. He was found mentally too unstable to
stand trial and was sent as under trial to Lok Priya Gopinath Bordoloi
Mental Hospital in Tejpur for treatment.

Machal was treated successfully and doctors wrote twice to jail
authorities in 1967 and 1996 that he was fit to stand  trial. But no
one paid any attention. Machal Lalung remained in “judicial custody.’’

Machal Lalung was released in July 2005. He was 77 then. He
spent 54 years under custody during which his case never came up
for hearing. He was freed when a team appointed by the National
Human Rights Commission intervened after an inspection of
undertrials in the State.

Machal’s entire life was wasted because a proper trial
against him never took place. Our Constitution gives every What if Machal was a rich and

Indian Constitution at Work

In the case of the first instance also there was violation
of rights provided in the Constitution. But it was
challenged in the court. As a result, workers could get
what was due to them in the form of their rightful wages.
The constitutional guarantee of the right against
exploitation ensured justice to these workers.

Bill of Rights
Both these examples show the importance of having rights
and of the actual implementation of these rights. A
democracy must ensure that individuals have certain
rights and that the government will always recognise these
rights. Therefore it is often a practice in most democratic
countries to list the rights of the citizens in the constitution
itself. Such a list of rights mentioned and protected by
the constitution is called the ‘bill of rights’. A bill of rights
prohibits government from thus acting against the rights
of the individuals and ensures a remedy in case there is
violation of these rights.

From whom does a constitution protect the rights of
the individual? The rights of a person may be threatened
by another person or private organisation. In such a
situation, the individual would need the protection of the
government. So, it is necessary that the government is
bound to protect the rights of the individual. On the other
hand, the organs of the government (the legislature,
executive, bureaucracy or even the judiciary), in the course
of their functioning, may violate the rights of the person.

These are examples of clear discrimination. In one
instance the discrimination is based on caste and in
another it is based on gender. Do you think that such

Right to equality tries to do away with such and other
discriminations. It provides for equal access to public
places like shops, hotels, places of entertainment, wells,
bathing ghats and places of worship. There cannot be
any discrimination in this access on the grounds only of

The practice of untouchability is one of the crudest
manifestations of inequality. This has been abolished

that the state shall confer no title on a person except those

right to equality strives to make India a true democracy
by ensuring a sense of equality of dignity and status
among all its citizens.

of status and equality of opportunity. Equality of opportunity means
that all sections of the society enjoy equal opportunities. But in a 33
society where there are various kinds of social inequalities, what does
equal opportunity mean? The Constitution clarifies that the
government can implement special schemes and measures for
improving the conditions of certain sections of society: children,
women, and the socially and educationally backward classes. You
may have heard about ‘reservations’ in jobs, and in admissions. You
would have wondered why there are reservations if we follow the
principle of equality. In fact Article 16(4) of the constitution explicitly
clarifies that a policy like reservation will not be seen as a violation of
right to equality. If you see the spirit of the Constitution, this is
required for the fulfilment of the right to equality of opportunity.

Indian Constitution at Work

Article 21: Protection of life and personal
liberty—No person shall be deprived of his
life or personal liberty except according
to procedure established by law.

RIGHT TO FREEDOM

Equality and freedom or liberty, are the two rights that
are most essential to a democracy. It is not possible to
think of the one without thinking of the other. Liberty
means freedom of thought, expression and action. However
it does not mean freedom to do anything that one desires
or likes. If that were to be permitted then a large number
of people will not be able to enjoy their freedom. Therefore,
freedoms are defined in such a manner that every person
will enjoy her freedom without threatening freedom of
others and without endangering the law and order
situation.

Right to life and personal liberty
The foremost right among rights to freedom is the right to
life and personal liberty. No citizen can be denied his or
her life except by procedure as laid down under the law.
Similarly no one can be denied his/her personal liberty.

Does it mean that in some cases That means no one can be arrested without being told

Can you think of an example? Also, it is mandatory for the police to take that person to

the nearest magistrate within 24 hours. The magistrate,
who is not part of the police, will decide whether the arrest
is justified or not.

This right is not just confined to a guarantee against
34 taking away of an individual’s life but has wider

application. Various judgments of Supreme Court have
expanded the scope of this right. The Supreme Court

Reprint 2025-26



Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution

has ruled that this right also includes right to live with human dignity,
free from exploitation. The court has held that right to shelter and 35
livelihood is also included in the right to life because no person can
live without the means of living, that is, the means of livelihood.

Preventive detention
Ordinarily, a person would be arrested after he or she has reportedly
committed some offence. However there are exceptions to this.
Sometimes a person can be arrested simply out of an apprehension
that he or she is likely to engage in unlawful activity and imprisoned
for some time without following the above mentioned procedure. This
is known as preventive detention. It means that if the government
feels that a person can be a threat to law and order or to the peace
and security of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person. This
preventive detention can be extended only for three months. After
three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for
review.

On the face of it, preventive detention looks like an effective tool
in the hands of the government to deal with anti-social elements or
subversives. But this provision has often been misused by the
government. Many people think that there must be greater safeguards
in this law so that it may not be misused against people for reasons
other than that which are really justified. In fact, there is a clear
tension between right to life and personal liberty and the provision
for preventive detention.

Other freedoms
You can see that under the right to freedom there are some other
rights as well. These rights however are not absolute. Each of these
is subject to restrictions imposed by the government.

For example right to freedom of speech and expression is subject
to restrictions such as public order, peace and morality etc. Freedom
to assemble too is to be exercised peacefully and without arms. The
government may impose restrictions in certain areas declaring the
assembly of five or more persons as unlawful. Such powers can be
easily misused by the administration. The genuine protest against
an act or policy of government by the people may be denied

Reprint 2025-26

permission. However, if the people are aware and vigilant in regard
to their rights and choose to protest against such acts of
administration such misuse becomes rare.  In the Constituent
Assembly itself, some members had expressed their dissatisfaction
about restrictions on rights.

“I feel that many of these fundamental
rights have been framed from the point of
view of a police constable… you will find that
very minimum rights have been conceded
and are almost invariably followed by a
proviso. Almost every article is followed by
a proviso which takes away the right almost
completely,...
…What should be our conception of
fundamental rights?...We want to
incorporate every one of those rights which
our people want to get.”

Somnath Lahiri
CAD, Vol. III, p. 404, 29 April 1947

Rights of accused
Our Constitution ensures that persons accused of various offences
would also get sufficient protection. We often tend to believe that
anyone who is charged with some offence is guilty. However, no one is
guilty unless the court has found that person guilty of an offence. It is
also necessary that a person accused of any crime should get adequate
opportunity to defend herself or himself. To ensure a fair trial in courts,
the Constitution has provided three rights:

± no person would be punished for the same offence more than
once,

36 ± no law shall declare any action as illegal from a backdate,
and

± no person shall be asked to give evidence against himself or
herself.

RIGHT AGAINST EXPLOITATION

In our country there are millions of
people who are underprivileged and
deprived. They may be subjected to
exploitation by their fellow human
beings. One such form of
exploitation in our country has been
begar or forced labour without
payment. Another closely related
form of exploitation is buying and
selling of human beings and using
them as slaves. Both of these are
prohibited under the Constitution.
Forced labour was imposed by
landlords, moneylenders and other
wealthy persons in the past. Some

Indian Constitution at Work

The Constitution also forbids employment of children below the
age of 14 years in dangerous jobs like factories and mines. With
child labour being made illegal and right to education becoming a
fundamental right for children, this right against exploitation has
become more meaningful.

RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF RELIGION
According to our Constitution, everyone enjoys the right to follow
the religion of his or her choice.  This freedom is considered as a
hallmark of democracy. Historically, there were rulers and emperors
in different parts of the world who did not allow residents of their
countries to enjoy the right to freedom of religion. Persons following
a religion different from that of the ruler were either persecuted or
forced to convert to the official religion of the rulers. Therefore,
democracy has always incorporated the freedom to follow the religion
of one’s choice as one of its basic principles.

Freedom of faith and worship
In India, everyone is free to choose a religion and practice that religion.
Freedom of religion also includes the freedom of conscience. This
means that a person may choose any religion or may choose not to
follow any religion. Freedom of religion includes the freedom to
profess, follow and propagate any religion. Freedom of religion is
subject to certain limitations. The government can impose restrictions
on the practice of freedom of religion in order to protect public order,
morality and health. This means that the freedom of religion is not
an unlimited right. The government can interfere in religious matters
for rooting out certain social evils. For example in the past, the
government has taken steps banning practices like sati, bigamy or
human sacrifice. Such restrictions cannot be opposed in the name
of interference in right to freedom of religion.

The limitations on the right to freedom of religion always produce
tensions between followers of various religions and the government.
When the government seeks to restrict some activities of any religious
group, people of that religion feel that this is interference in their

38 religion.
Freedom of religion becomes a matter of political controversy for

yet another reason. The Constitution has guaranteed the right
to propagate one’s religion. This includes persuading people to

Reprint 2025-26



Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution

convert from one religion to another. However, some people resent
conversions on the ground that these are based on intimidation or 39
inducement. The Constitution does not allow forcible conversions. It
only gives us the right to spread information about our religion and
thus attract others to it.

Equality of all religions
Being a country which is home to several religions, it is necessary
that the government must extend equal treatment to different
religions. Negatively, it means that government will not favour any
particular religion. India does not have any official religion. We don’t
have to belong to any particular religion in order to be a prime
minister or president or judge or any other public official. We have
also seen that under the right to equality, there is a guarantee that
government will not discriminate on the basis of religion in giving
employment. The institutions run by the state will not preach any
religion or give religious education nor will they favour persons of
any religion. The objective of these provisions is to sustain and
nurture the principle of secularism.

CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS
When we talk of the Indian society, the image of diversity comes before
our minds. India is not made up of a monolithic society. We are a
society that has vast diversity. In such a society that is full of diversity,
there would be social sections which are small in numbers compared
to some other groups. If a group is in minority, will it have to adopt
the culture of the majority?
Our Constitution believes that diversity is our strength. Therefore,
one of the fundamental rights is the right of the minorities to
maintain their culture. This minority status is not dependent only

“A heavy responsibility would be cast

It pays them to be nationalists ...The
majority community should not boast
of their national outlook. ...They should
try to place themselves in the position
of the minorities and try to appreciate
their fears. All demands for safeguards
...are the products of those fears that
the minorities have in their minds, ...as
regards their language, their script and

upon religion. Linguistic and cultural minorities are also included
in this provision. Minorities are groups that have common language
or religion and in a particular part of the country or in the country
as a whole, they are outnumbered by some other social section. Such
communities have a culture, language and a script of their own, and
have the right to conserve and develop these.

All minorities, religious or linguistic, can set up their own
educational institutions. By doing so, they can preserve and develop
their own culture. The government will not, while granting aid to
educational institutions, discriminate against any educational
institution on the basis that it is under the management of minority
community.

RIGHT TO CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES

One would agree that our Constitution contains a very impressive
40 list of Fundamental Rights. But merely writing down a list of rights

is not enough. There has to be a way through which they could be
realised in practice and defended against any attack on these rights.

Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution

Right to constitutional remedies is the means through
which this is to be achieved. Dr. Ambedkar considered 41
the right to constitutional remedies as ‘heart and soul of
the constitution’. It is so because this right gives a citizen
the right to approach a High Court or the Supreme Court
to get any of the fundamental rights restored in case of
their violation. The Supreme Court and the High Courts
can issue orders and give directives to the government for
the enforcement of rights.
The courts can issue various special orders known as
writs.

± Habeas corpus: A writ of habeas corpus means I am in minority in my locality
that the court orders that the arrested person but majority in the town,
should be presented before it. It can also order to minority if you look at my

finds that a particular office holder is not doing
legal duty and thereby is infringing on the right of
an individual.

± Prohibition: This writ is issued by a higher court
(High Court or Supreme Court) when a lower court
has considered a case going beyond its jurisdiction.

± Quo Warranto: If the court finds that a person is
holding office but is not entitled to hold that office,
it issues the writ of quo warranto and restricts that
person from acting as an office holder.

± Certiorari: Under this writ, the court orders a
lower court or another authority to transfer a
matter pending before it to the higher authority or
court.

Apart from the judiciary, many other mechanisms
have been created in later years for the protection of
rights. You may have heard about the National
Commission on Minorities, the National Commission on
Women, the National Commission on Scheduled Castes,

Reprint 2025-26

etc. These institutions protect the rights of women, minorities or
Dalits. Besides, the National Human Rights Commission has also
been established by law to protect the fundamental and other kinds
of rights.

National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
The real test of the rights given by any constitution is in
their actual implementation. The poor, illiterate and the
deprived sections of the society must be able to exercise
their rights. Independent organisations like the People’s
Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) or People’s Union for
Democratic Rights (PUDR) have been working as
watchdogs against the violations of rights. In this
background, the government has established in 1993 an
institution, the National Human Rights Commission.

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is
composed of a former chief justice of the Supreme Court
of India, a former judge of the Supreme Court, a former
chief justice of a High Court and two other members who
have knowledge and practical experience in matters
relating to human rights.

The Commission’s functions include inquiry at its own
initiative or on a petition presented to it by a victim into
complaint of violation of human rights; visit to jails to
study the condition of the inmates; undertaking and
promoting research in the field of human rights, etc.

The Commission receives complaints in thousands
every year. These relate to custodial death, custodial rape,
disappearances, police excesses, failure in taking action,
indignity to women, etc. Its most significant intervention
has been on disappeared youth in Punjab and
investigation and trial of Gujarat riot cases where its
intervention proved effective.

The Commission does not have the power of
prosecution. It can merely make recommendations to the

42 government or recommend to the courts to initiate
proceedings based on the inquiry that it conducts.

Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution

DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY
43

The makers of our Constitution knew that independent India was
going to face many challenges. Foremost among these was the
challenge to bring about equality and well-being of all citizens. They
also thought that certain policy direction was required for handling
these problems. At the same time, the Constitution did not want
future governments to be bound by certain policy decisions.

Therefore, some guidelines were incorporated in the Constitution
but they were not made legally enforceable: this means that if a
government did not implement a particular guideline, we cannot go
to the court asking the court to instruct the government to implement
that policy. Thus, these guidelines are ‘non-justiciable’ i.e., parts of
the Constitution that cannot be enforced by the judiciary. Those who
framed our Constitution thought that the moral force behind these
guidelines would ensure that the government would take them
seriously. Besides, they expected that the people would also hold
the governments responsible for implementing these directives. So,
a separate list of policy guidelines is included in the Constitution.
The list of these guidelines is called the Directive Principles of State
Policy.

What do the Directive Principles contain?
The chapter on Directive Principles lists mainly three things:

± the goals and objectives that we as a society should adopt;
± certain rights that individuals should enjoy apart from the

Fundamental Rights; and
± certain policies that the government should adopt.
You may get some idea of the vision of makers of our Constitution

by looking at some of the Directive Principles shown below.
The governments from time to time tried to give effect to some

Directive Principles of State Policy. They passed several zamindari
abolition bills, nationalised banks, enacted numerous factory laws,
fixed minimum wages, cottage and small industries were promoted
and provisions for reservation for the uplift of the scheduled castes
and scheduled tribes were made. Such efforts to give effect to the

Reprint 2025-26

Directive Principles include the right to education, formation of
panchayati raj institutions all over the country, partial right to work
under employment guarantee programme and the mid-day meal
scheme etc.

Fundamental Duties of citizens
± In 1976, the 42nd amendment to the Constitution was

passed. Among other things, this amendment inserted
a list of Fundamental Duties of Citizens. In all, ten duties
were enumerated. However, the Constitution does not
say anything about enforcing these duties.

± As citizens, we must abide by the Constitution, defend
our country, promote harmony among all citizens, protect
the environment.

± However, it must be noted that our Constitution does
not make the enjoyment of rights dependent or
conditional upon fulfilment of duties. In this sense, the
inclusion of fundamental duties has not changed the
status of our fundamental rights.

Principles exhort the government to do certain things. Fundamental
Rights mainly protect the rights of individuals while directive
principles ensure the well-being of the entire society.

However, at times, when government intends to implement
Directive Principles of State Policy, it can come in conflict with the
Fundamental Rights of the citizen.

This problem arose when the government sought to pass laws to
abolish zamindari system. These measures were opposed on the
ground that they violated right to property. However, keeping in mind
the societal needs that are greater than the individual interests, the
government amended the Constitution to give effect to the Directive
Principles of State Policy. This led to a long legal battle. The executive
and the judiciary took different positions. The government claimed
that rights can be abridged for giving effect to Directive Principles.
This argument assumed that rights were a hindrance to welfare of
the people. On the other hand, the court held the view that
Fundamental Rights were so important and sacred that they cannot
be limited even for purposes of implementing Directive Principles.

Right to Property
Behind the controversy about the relationship between rights
and directive principles, there was one important reason: in
the Constitution, originally, there was a fundamental right to
‘acquire, possess and maintain’ property. But the Constitution
made it clear that property could be taken away by the
government for public welfare. Since 1950, government made
many laws that limited this right to property. This right was at
the centre of the long debate over the relationship between rights
and directive principles. Finally, in 1973, the Supreme Court
gave a decision that the right to property was not part of the
basic structure of the Constitution and therefore, parliament
had power to abridge this right by an amendment. In 1978, the
44th amendment to the Constitution removed the right to property
from the list of Fundamental Rights and converted it into a simple

46 legal right under article 300 A.
What difference, do you think, this change of status makes

to the right to property?

Reprint 2025-26



Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution

This generated another complicated debate. This related to the
amendment of the Constitution. The government was saying that 47
Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution. The court was
saying that Parliament cannot make an amendment that violated
Fundamental Rights. This controversy was settled by an important
decision of the Supreme Court in Kesavananda Bharati case. In this
case, the court said that there are certain basic features of the
Constitution and these cannot be changed by Parliament. We shall
discuss this in greater detail in Chapter 9 on ‘Constitution as a Living
Document’.

Conclusion

In the writings of Jotirao Phuley (1827-1890), a radical social
reformer from Maharashtra, we find one of the earliest
expressions of the view that rights include both freedom and
equality. During the national movement, this idea of rights was
further sharpened and expanded to constitutional rights. Our
Constitution reflected this long tradition and listed the
fundamental rights. Since 1950, the judiciary has functioned
as an important protector of rights.

Judicial interpretations have expanded the scope of rights
in many respects. The government and administration of our
country function within this overall framework. Rights enforce
limitations on the functioning of the government and ensure
democratic governance of the country.

ELECTION AND
REPRESENTATION
INTRODUCTION

Have you ever played chess? What would happen if the black knight suddenly
started moving straight rather than two and a half squares? Or, what would
happen if in a game of cricket, there were no umpires? In any sport, we need to
follow certain rules. Change the rules and the outcome of the game would be
very different. Similarly a game needs an impartial umpire whose decision is
accepted by all the players. The rules and the umpire have to be agreed upon
before we begin to play a game. What is true of a game is also true of elections.
There are different rules or systems of conducting elections. The outcome of the
election depends on the rules  we have adopted.  We need some machinery to
conduct the elections in an impartial manner. Since these two decisions need to
be taken before the game of electoral politics can begin, these cannot be left to
any government. That is why these basic decisions about elections are written
down in the constitution of a democratic country.

In this chapter we shall study the constitutional provisions regarding elections
and representation. We shall focus on the importance of the method of election
chosen in our Constitution and the implications of the constitutional provisions
regarding impartial machinery for conducting elections. We shall also look at
some suggestions for amending the constitutional provisions in this respect. After
reading this chapter,  you would understand:
± different methods of election;
± the characteristics of the system of election adopted in our country;
± the importance of the provisions for free and fair elections; and
± the debate on electoral reforms.

ELECTIONS AND DEMOCRACY

Let us begin by asking ourselves two simple questions about elections
and democracy.
± Can we have democracy without holding elections?
± Can we hold elections without having democracy?

Let us have a discussion in the classroom on both these questions
by using examples from whatever we have learnt so far in the previous
classes.

The first question reminds

R us of the necessity of

representation in a large
democracy. All citizens cannot
take direct part in making
every decision. Therefore,
representatives are elected by
the people. This is how elections
become important.  Whenever
we think of India as a
democracy, our mind
invariably turns to the last
elections. Elections have today
become the most visible
symbol of the democratic
process.  We often distinguish
between direct and indirect
democracy. A direct
democracy is one where the
citizens directly participate in

Chapter 3: Election and Representation

democracy. But this kind of direct democracy cannot be
practiced when a decision has to be taken by lakhs and 53
crores of people. That is why rule by the people usually
means rule by people’s representatives.

In such an arrangement citizens choose their
representatives who, in turn, are actively involved in
governing and administering the country. The method
followed to choose these representatives is referred to as
an election. Thus, the citizens have a limited role in taking
major decisions and in running the administration. They
are not very actively involved in making of the policies.
Citizens are involved only indirectly, through their elected
representatives. In this arrangement, where all major
decisions are taken by elected representatives, the method
by which people elect their representatives becomes very
important.

The second question reminds us of the fact that not
all elections are democratic. A large number of non-
democratic countries also hold elections. In fact non-
democratic rulers are very keen to present themselves as
democratic. They do so by holding election in such a way
that it does not threaten their rule. Can you think of some
examples of such non-democratic elections? What do you
think would distinguish a democratic from a non-
democratic election? What can be done to ensure that
elections in a country would be conducted in a
democratic way?

This is where constitution comes in. The constitution
of a democratic country lays down some basic rules about
elections. The details are usually left to be worked out by
laws passed by the legislatures. These basic rules are
usually about
± Who is eligible to vote?
± Who is eligible to contest?
± Who is to supervise elections? What is the need of writing

± How do the voters choose their representatives? these rules in the constitution?

± How are the votes to be counted and Why can’t these be decided by

parties before every election?

It talks of one historic moment in India’s democracy.
In the Lok Sabha elections of 1984, the Congress party
came to power winning 415 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats –
more than 80% of the seats. Such a victory was never
achieved by any party in the Lok Sabha. What did this
election show?

it mean that four out of five Indian voters voted for the

Lok Sabha.  Look at the performance of other parties. The
BJP got 7.4 per cent votes but less than one per cent seats.
How did that happen?

AGP    1.0     7

This happened because in our country we follow a
special method of elections. Under this system:
± The entire country is divided into 543 constituencies;

56 ± Each constituency elects one representative; and
± The candidate who secures the highest number of

votes in that constituency is declared elected.
It is important to note that in this system whoever has

Reprint 2025-26



Chapter 3: Election and Representation

more votes than all other candidates, is declared elected.
The winning candidate need not secure a majority of the 57
votes. This method is called the First Past the Post (FPTP)
system. In the electoral race, the candidate who is ahead
of others, who crosses the winning post first of all, is the
winner. This method is also called the Plurality System.
This is the method of election prescribed by the
Constitution.

Let us now go back to our example. The Congress
party won greater share of seats than its share of votes
because in many of the  constituencies in which its
candidates won, they secured less than 50% of the votes.
If there are several candidates, the winning candidate often
gets much less than 50% of the votes. The votes that go to
all the losing candidates go ‘waste’, for those candidates
or parties get no seat from those votes. Suppose a party
gets only 25 per cent of the votes in every constituency,
but everyone else gets even less votes. In that case, the
party could win all the seats with only 25 per cent votes
or even less.

Proportional Representation
Let us compare this to how elections take place in Israel
that follows a very different system of elections. In Israel
once the votes are counted, each party is allotted the share
of seats in the parliament in proportion to its share of
votes (see Box). Each party fills its quota of seats by picking
those many of its nominees from a preference list that has
been declared before the elections. This system of elections
is called the Proportional Representation (PR) system. In
this system a party gets the same proportion of seats as
its proportion of votes.

In the PR system there could be two variations. In
some countries, like Israel or Netherlands, the entire This is very confusing! How do

constituencies as in Argentina and Portugal. Each party prepares a
list of candidates for each constituency, depending on how many
have to be elected from that constituency. In both these variations,
voters exercise their preference for a party and not a candidate. The
seats in a constituency are distributed on the basis of votes polled

58 by a party. Thus, representatives from a constituency, would and
do belong to different parties. In India, we have adopted PR system

Proportional Representation in Israel
Israel follows proportional representation system of election. Elections to
the legislature (Knesset) take place every four years. Every party declares a
list of its candidates, but voters vote for the party and not for the candidates.
A party gets seats in the legislature in proportion to the votes polled by it.
This allows even smaller parties with very small support base to get
representation in the legislature. (A party must get a minimum of 3.25%
votes to be eligible to get seats in the legislature.)  This often leads to a
multi-party coalition government.

How does PR work in Rajya Sabha elections
A third variant of PR, the Single Transferable Vote system
(STV), is followed for Rajya Sabha elections. Every State
has a specific quota of seats in the Rajya Sabha. The
members are elected by the respective State legislative
assemblies. The voters are the MLAs in that State. Every
voter is required to rank candidates according to her or
his preference. To be declared the winner, a candidate
must secure a minimum quota of votes, which is
determined by a formula:

 Total votespolled 
  +1
 Total number of candidates to be elected +1 

For example if 4 Rajya Sabha members have to be
elected by the 200 MLAs in Rajasthan, the winner would
require (200/4+1= 40+1) 41 votes. When the votes are
counted it is done on the basis of first preference votes
secured by each candidate, of which the candidate has
secured the first preference votes. If after the counting of
all first preference votes, required number of candidates
fail to fulfil the quota, the candidate who secured the
lowest votes of first preference is eliminated and his/her
votes are transferred to those who are mentioned as
second preference on those ballot papers. This process
continues till the required number of candidates are
declared elected.

Why did India adopt the FPTP system?
The answer is not very difficult to guess. If you have carefully read
the box explaining the Rajya Sabha elections, you would have noticed
that it is a complicated system which may work in a small country,

60 but would be difficult to work in a sub-continental country like India.
The reason for the popularity and success of the FPTP system is its
simplicity. The entire election system is extremely simple to
understand even for common voters who may have no specialised

knowledge about politics and elections.  There is also a clear choice
presented to the voters at the time of elections. Voters have to simply 61
endorse a candidate or a party while voting. Depending on the nature
of actual politics, voters may either give greater importance to the
party or to the candidate or balance the two.  The FPTP system offers
voters a choice not simply between parties but specific candidates.
In other electoral systems, especially PR systems, voters are often
asked to choose a party and the representatives are elected on the
basis of party lists. As a result, there is no one representative who
represents and is responsible for one locality. In constituency based
system like the FPTP, the voters know who their own representative
is and can hold him or her accountable.

system generally gives the largest party or coalition some extra bonus
seats, more than their share of votes would allow. Thus this system
makes it possible for parliamentary government to function smoothly
and effectively by facilitating the formation of a stable government.
Finally, the FPTP system encourages voters from different social
groups to come together to win an election in a locality. In a diverse
country like India, a PR system would encourage each community
to form its own nation-wide party. This may also have been at the
back of the mind of our constitution makers.

The experience of the working of the Constitution has confirmed

62 the expectation of the constitution makers. The FPTP system has
proved to be simple and familiar to ordinary voters. It has helped
larger parties to win clear majorities at the centre and the State level.
The system has also discouraged political parties that get all their

the FPTP system results in a two-party system. This means that 63
there are two major competitors for power and power is often shared
by these two parties alternately. It is difficult for new parties or the
third party to enter the competition and share power. In this respect,
the experience of FPTP in India is slightly different. After
independence, though we adopted the FPTP system, there emerged
a one party dominance and along with it, there existed many smaller
parties. After 1989, India is witnessing the functioning of the multi-
party coalitions. At the same time, gradually, in many States, a two-
party competition is emerging. But the distinguishing feature of
India’s party system is that the rise of coalitions has made it possible
for new and smaller parties to enter into electoral competition in spite
of the FPTP system.

RESERVATION OF CONSTITUENCIES

We have noticed that in the FPTP election system, the candidate who
secures the highest votes in a particular constituency is declared
elected. This often works to the disadvantage of the smaller social
groups. This is even more significant in the Indian social context. We
have had a history of caste-based discrimination. In such a social
system, the FPTP electoral system can mean that the dominant social
groups and castes can win everywhere and the oppressed social
groups may continue to remain unrepresented.  Our Constitution
makers were aware of this difficulty and the need to provide a way to
ensure fair and just representation to the oppressed social groups.

This issue was debated even before independence and the British
government had introduced ‘separate electorates’. This system meant

“Separate electorates have been a curse to India, have
done incalculable harm to this country… Separate
electorates have barred our progress… We (Muslims)
want to merge in the nation. ...for God’s sake keep
your hands off reservation for the Muslim
community.”

that for electing a representative from a particular community, only
those voters would be eligible who belong to that community. In the
Constituent Assembly, many members expressed a fear that this
will not suit our purposes. Therefore, it was decided to adopt the
system of reserved constituencies. In this system, all voters in a
constituency are eligible to vote but the candidates must belong to
only a particular community or social section for which the seat is
reserved.

There are certain social groups which may be spread across the
country. In a particular constituency, their numbers may not be
sufficient to be able to influence a victory of a candidate.  However,
taken across the country they are a significantly sizeable group. To
ensure their proper representation, a system of reservation becomes
necessary. The Constitution provides for reservation of seats in the
Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies for the Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes. This provision was made initially for a period
of 10 years and as a result of successive constitutional amendments,
has been extended up to 2030. The Parliament can take a decision
to further extend it, when the period of reservation expires. The
number of seats reserved for both of these groups is in proportion to
their share in the population of India. Of the 543 elected seats in the
Lok Sabha, 84 are reserved for Scheduled Castes and 47 are reserved
for Scheduled Tribes (as on 26 January 2019).

“…But I have come to say a few words on behalf of the
Adivasis of India…. In the past, thanks to the major
political parties, thanks to the British Government and
thanks to every enlightened Indian citizen, we have been
isolated and kept, as it were, in a zoo. ...We are willing to
mix with you, and it is for that reason, ..., that we have
insisted on a reservation of seats as far as the Legislatures
are concerned. We have not asked ...(for) separate
electorates; ...Under the 1935 Act, throughout the
Legislatures in India, there were altogether only 24

64 Adivasi MLAs out of a total of 1585, …and not a single
representative at the Centre.”

Jaipal Singh, CAD, Vol. V, pp. 209-210, 27 August 1947

Reprint 2025-26



Chapter 3: Election and Representation

Who decides which constituency is to be reserved? On what basis
is this decision taken? This decision is taken by an independent 65
body called the Delimitation Commission. The Delimitation
Commission is appointed by the President of India and works in
collaboration with the Election Commission of India.  It is appointed for
the purpose of drawing up the boundaries of constituencies all over the
country. A quota of constituencies to be reserved in each State is fixed
depending on the proportion of SC or ST in that State. After drawing
the boundaries, the Delimitation Commission looks at the composition
of population in each constituency. Those constituencies that have the
highest proportion of Scheduled Tribe population are reserved for ST.
In the case of Scheduled Castes, the Delimitation Commission looks at
two things. It picks constituencies that have higher proportion of
Scheduled Caste population. But it also spreads these constituencies
in different regions of the State.  This is done because the Scheduled
Caste population is generally spread evenly throughout the country.
These reserved constituencies can be rotated each time the
Delimitation exercise is undertaken.

The Constitution does not make similar reservation for other
disadvantaged groups. Of late there has been a strong demand
seeking reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies
for women. Given the fact that very few women are elected to
representative bodies, the demand for reserving one-third seats for
women was articulated for many years. Reservation of seats for
women has already been provided for rural and urban local bodies.
We shall discuss this in chapter on Local Governments. A similar
provision for Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas has been provided
through the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam (Women's Reservation
Act, 2023).

FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS

The true test of any election system is its ability to ensure a free and
fair electoral process. If we want democracy to be translated into
reality on the ground, it is important that the election system is
impartial and transparent. The system of election must also allow
the aspirations of the voter to find legitimate expression through the
electoral results.

The proportion of Muslims in the population of India
is about 14.2 per cent. But the number of Muslim

creation of an independent Election Commission to ‘supervise and
conduct’ elections. Do you know that in many countries, there is an
absence of an independent mechanism for conducting elections?

Article 324: (1)
The superintendence, direction and control of
the preparation of the electoral rolls for, and
the conduct of, all elections to Parliament and
to the Legislature of every State and of
elections to the offices of President and Vice-
President held under this Constitution shall
be vested in a Commission (referred to in this
Constitution as the Election Commission).

Article 324 of the Indian Constitution provides for an independent
Election Commission for the ‘superintendence, direction and control
of the electoral roll and the conduct of elections’ in India. These words
in the Constitution are very important, for they give the Election
Commission a decisive role in virtually everything to do with elections.
The Supreme Court has agreed with this interpretation of the
Constitution.

To assist the Election Commission of India there is a Chief Electoral
Officer in every state. The Election Commission is not responsible for
the conduct of local body elections. As we shall study in the chapter
on Local Government, the State Election Commissioners work
independently of the Election Commission of India and each has its
own sphere of operation.

The Election Commission of India can either be a single member
or a multi-member body. Till 1989, the Election Commission was
single member. Just before the 1989 general elections, two Election
Commissioners were appointed, making the body multi-member.
Soon after the elections, the Commission reverted to its single member
status. In 1993, two Election Commissioners were once again

68 appointed and the Commission became multi-member and has
remained multi-member since then. Initially there were many
apprehensions about a multi-member Commission. There was a
sharp difference of opinion between the then Chief Election

Commissioner and the other Commissioners about who
had how much power. The matter had to be settled by the 69
Supreme Court. Now there is a general consensus that a
multi-member Election Commission is more appropriate
as power is shared and there is greater accountability.

The Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) presides over
the Election Commission, but does not have more powers
than the other Election Commissioners. The CEC and the
two Election Commissioners have equal powers to take
all decisions relating to elections as a collective body.  They
are appointed by the President of India on the advice of
the Council of Ministers. It is therefore possible for a ruling
party to appoint a partisan person to the Commission
who might favour them in the elections. This fear has led
many to suggest that this procedure should be changed.

The Election Commission of India has a wide range of functions.
± It supervises the preparation of up-to-date voters’ list. It makes

every effort to ensure that the voters’ list is free of errors like non-
existence of names of registered voters or existence of names of
those non-eligible or non-existent.

± It also determines the timing of elections and prepares the election
schedule.  The election schedule includes the notification of
elections, date from which nominations can be filed, last date for
filing nominations, last date of scrutiny, last date of withdrawal,
date of polling and date of counting and declaration of results.

± During this entire process, the Election Commission has the power
to take decisions to ensure a free and fair poll. It can postpone or
cancel the election in the entire country or a specific State or
constituency on the grounds that the atmosphere is vitiated and
therefore, a free and fair election may not be possible.   The
Commission also implements a model code of conduct for parties
and candidates. It can order a re-poll in a specific constituency.
It can also order a recount of votes when it feels that the counting
process has not been fully fair and just.

± The Election Commission accords recognition to political parties
and allots symbols to each of them.
The Election Commission has very limited staff of its own. It

conducts the elections with the help of the administrative machinery.
However, once the election process has begun, the commission has
control over the administration as far as election related work is
concerned. During the election process, the administrative officers of
the State and central governments are assigned election related duty
and in this respect, the Election Commission has full control over
them. The EC can transfer the officers, or stop their transfers; it can
take action against them for failing to act in a non-partisan manner.

Over the years, the Election Commission of India has emerged as
70 an independent authority which has asserted its powers to ensure

fairness in the election process. It has acted in an impartial and

process. The record of Election Commission also shows that every

Conclusion
In countries where representative democracy is practiced,
elections and the representative character of those elections
are crucial factors in making democracy effective and
trustworthy. The success of India’s election system can be
gauged from a number of factors.
± Our election system has allowed the voters not only to freely
choose representatives, but also to change governments
peacefully both at the State and national level.
± Secondly, voters have consistently taken a keen interest in
the election process and participated in it. The number of
candidates and parties that contest elections is on the rise.
± Thirdly, the system of election has proved to be
accommodative and inclusive. The social composition of our
representatives has changed gradually. Now our representatives
come from many different social sections, though the number
of women legislators has not increased satisfactorily.
± Fourthly, the election outcome in most parts of the country
does not reflect electoral malpractices and rigging. Of course,
many attempts at rigging do take place. You must have read
about violence, about complaints that voters’ names disappear
from the voters’ list, about intimidation, and so on. Yet, such
instances rarely directly affect the outcome of the election.
± Finally and most importantly, elections have become a part
and parcel of our democratic life. No one can imagine a situation
where a government would disrespect the verdict of an election.
Similarly, no one can imagine that a government would be

74 formed without holding elections. In fact, regularity and
periodicity of elections has earned fame for India as a great
democratic experiment.

Chapter 3: Election and Representation

All these factors have earned for our election system a
respect within and outside the country. The voter in India has 75
gained confidence. The legitimacy of the Election Commission
has increased in the eyes of the people.  This vindicates the
basic decisions taken by our Constitution makers. If the election
process becomes more flawless, we as voters and citizens would
be able to share more effectively in this carnival of democracy
and make it more meaningful.

Indian Constitution at Work

Chapter Four

EXECUTIVE

INTRODUCTION

Legislature, executive and judiciary are the three organs of government.  Together,
they perform the functions of the government, maintain law and order and look
after the welfare of the people.  The Constitution ensures that they work in
coordination with each other and maintain a balance among themselves. In a
parl iamentary system,  executive  and the legis lature  are  interdependent:  the
legislature controls the executive, and, in turn, is controlled by the executive.
In this chapter we shall discuss the composition, structure and function of the
executive organ of the government. This chapter will  also tell  you about the
changes that have occurred in recent times due to political practice. After reading
this chapter, you will be able to
± make a distinction between the parliamentary and the presidential executive;
± understand the constitutional position of the President of India;

78 ± know the composition and functioning of the Council of Ministers and the
importance of the Prime Minister;  and

Chapter 4: Executive

WHAT IS AN EXECUTIVE?
Who is in charge of the administration of your school? 79
Who takes important decisions in a school or a university?
In any organisation, some office holder has to take
decisions and implement those decisions. We call this
activity administration or management. But
administration requires a body at the top that will take
policy decisions or the big decisions and supervise and
coordinate the routine administrative functioning. You
may have heard about the executives of big companies,
banks or industrial units. Every formal group has a body
of those who function as the chief administrators or the
executives of that organisation. Some office holders decide
the policies and rules and regulations and then some office
holders implement those decisions in actual day-to-day
functioning of the organisation. The word executive means
a body of persons that looks after the implementation of
rules and regulations in actual practice.

In the case of government also, one body may take
policy decisions and decide about rules and regulations,
while the other one would be in charge of implementing
those rules. The organ of government that primarily looks
after the function of implementation and administration
is called the executive.

What are the principal functions of the executive?
Executive is the branch of government responsible for the
implementation of laws and policies adopted by the
legislature. The executive is often involved in framing of
policy. The official designations of the executive vary from
country to country. Some countries have presidents, while
others have chancellors. The executive branch is not just
about presidents, prime ministers and ministers. It also I remember somebody saying

WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXECUTIVE?

Every country may not have the same type of executive. You may
have heard about the President of the USA and the Queen of England.
But the powers and functions of the President of the USA are very
different from the powers of the President of India. Similarly, the
powers of the Queen of England are different from the powers of the
King of Bhutan. Both India and France have prime ministers, but
their roles are different from each other. Why is this so?

Activity
Procure a photograph of the SAARC summit
meeting or the meeting of G-7 countries and list
those who attended the meeting. Can you imagine
why those people and not some others are attending
the meeting?

To answer this question we will briefly outline the nature of
executive existing in some of these countries. The USA has a
presidential system and executive powers are in the hands of the
president. Canada has a parliamentary democracy with a
constitutional monarchy where Queen Elizabeth II is the formal chief
of state and the prime minister is the head of government. In France,
both the president and the prime minister are a part of the semi-
presidential system. The president appoints the prime minister as
well as the ministers but cannot dismiss them as they are responsible
to the parliament. Japan has a parliamentary system with the
Emperor as the head of the state and the prime minister as the head
of government. Italy has a parliamentary system with the president
as the formal head of state and the prime minister as the head of
government. Russia has a semi-presidential system where president
is the head of state and prime minister, who is appointed by the
president, is the head of government. Germany has a parliamentary
system in which president is the ceremonial head of state and the
chancellor is the head of government.

80 In a presidential system, the president is the Head of state as well
as head of government. In this system the office of president is very
powerful, both in theory and practice. Countries with such a system
include the United States, Brazil and most nations in Latin America.

Semi-Presidential Executive in Sri Lanka
In 1978 the constitution of Sri Lanka was amended and the system of
Executive Presidency was introduced. Under the system of Executive
Presidency, people directly elect the President. It may happen that both
the President and the Prime Minister belong to the same political party
or to different political parties.

The President has vast powers under the constitution. The President
chooses the Prime Minister from the party that has a majority in the
Parliament. Though ministers must be members of the Parliament, the
President has the power to remove the Prime Minister, or ministers.
Apart from being the elected Head of State and the Commander-in-
Chief of the Armed Forces, the President is also the Head of the
Government.

Elected for a term of six years, the President cannot be removed
except by a resolution in the parliament passed by at least two-thirds
of the total number of Members of Parliament. If it is passed by not less
than one-half of the total number of Members of Parliament and the
Speaker is satisfied that such allegations merit inquiry then the Speaker
can report the matter to the Supreme Court.

How is the position of the President and Prime Minister in Sri Lanka
different from India? Compare the role of Supreme Court in the
impeachment of the President in India and Sri Lanka.

In a parliamentary system, the prime minister is the head of
government. Most parliamentary systems have a president or a
monarch who is the nominal Head of state. In such a system, the
role of president or monarch is primarily ceremonial and prime
minister along with the cabinet wields effective power. Countries with
such system include Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom as well
as Portugal. A semi-presidential system has both a president and a
prime minister but unlike the parliamentary system the president
may possess significant day-to-day powers. In this system, it is

82 possible that sometimes the president and the prime minister may
belong to the same party and at times they may belong to two different
parties and thus, would be opposed to each other. Countries with
such a system include France, Russia, Sri Lanka, etc.

PARLIAMENTARY EXECUTIVE IN INDIA

When the Constitution of India was written, India already
had some experience of running the parliamentary system
under the Acts of 1919 and 1935. This experience had
shown that in the parliamentary system, the executive
can be effectively controlled by the representatives of the
people. The makers of the Indian Constitution wanted to
ensure that the government would be sensitive to public
expectations and would be responsible and accountable.
The other alternative to the parliamentary executive was
the presidential form of government. But the presidential
executive puts much emphasis on the president as the
chief executive and as source of all executive power.  There
is always the danger of personality cult in presidential
executive. The makers of the Indian Constitution wanted
a government that would have a strong executive branch,
but at the same time, enough safeguards should be there
to check against the personality cult. In the parliamentary
form there are many mechanisms that ensure that the Haven’t we had very strong

and the Council of Ministers, which run the government at the
national level. At the State level, the executive comprises the Governor
and the Chief Minister and Council of Ministers.

The Constitution of India vests the executive power of the Union
formally in the President. In reality, the President exercises these powers
through the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. The
President is elected for a period of five years. But there is no direct
election by the people for the office of President. The President is elected
indirectly. This means that the president is elected not by the ordinary
citizens but by the elected MLAs and MPs. This election takes place in
accordance with the principle of proportional representation with single
transferable vote.

The President can be removed from office only by Parliament by
following the procedure for impeachment. This procedure requires a
special majority as explained in the last chapter. The only ground
for impeachment is violation of the Constitution.

Power and position of President

Article 74 (1): There shall be a Council of
Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head
to aid and advise the President who shall
in the exercise of his functions, act in
accordance with such advice.

Provided that the President may require
the Council of Ministers to reconsider such
advice….., and the President shall act in
accordance with the advice tendered after
such reconsideration.

Do you know what the word shall means here? It indicates that the
advice is binding on the President. In view of the controversy about the
scope of the President’s powers, a specific mention was made in the
Constitution by an amendment that the advice of the Council of
Ministers will be binding on the President. By another amendment

84 made later, it was decided that the President can ask the Council of
Ministers to reconsider its advice but, has to accept the reconsidered
advice of the Council of Ministers.

Chapter 4: Executive

We have already seen that President is the formal head
of the government. In this formal sense, the President has 85
wide ranging executive, legislative, judicial and emergency
powers. In a parliamentary system, these powers are in
reality used by the President only on the advice of the
Council of Ministers. The Prime Minister and the Council
of Ministers have support of the majority in the Lok Sabha
and they are the real executive. In most of the cases, the
President has to follow the advice of the Council of
Ministers.

“We did not give him any real
power but we have made his
position one of authority and
dignity. The constitution wants
to create neither a real
executive nor a mere

Besides this, there are at least three situations where
the President can exercise the powers using his or her
own discretion. In the first place, we have already noted
that the President can send back the advice given by the
Council of Ministers and ask the Council to reconsider
the decision. In doing this, the President acts on his (or
her) own discretion. When the President thinks that the
advice has certain flaws or legal lacunae, or that it is not
in the best interests of the country, the President can ask
the Council to reconsider the decision. Although, the

naturally carry a lot of weight. So, this is one way in which
the president can act in his own discretion.

Secondly, the President also has veto power by which
he can withhold or refuse to give assent to Bills (other
than Money Bill) passed by the Parliament. Every bill
passed by the Parliament goes to the President for his
assent before it becomes a law. The President can send
the bill back to the Parliament asking it to reconsider the

We saw that there is no time limit on the President for
giving his assent to a bill. Do you know that such a thing
has already happened? In 1986, the Parliament passed a
bill known as Indian Post office (amendment) bill. This bill
was widely criticised by many for it sought to curtail the
freedom of the press. The then President, Gyani Zail Singh,
did not take any decision on this bill. After his term was
over, the next President, Venkataraman sent the bill finally
back to the Parliament for reconsideration. By that time,
the government that brought the bill before the Parliament
had changed and a new government was elected in 1989.
This government belonged to a different coalition and did

86 not bring the bill back before the Parliament. Thus, Zail
Singh’s decision to postpone giving assent to the bill
effectively meant that the bill could never become a law!

Chapter 4: Executive

bill. This ‘veto’ power is limited because, if the Parliament passes the
same bill again and sends it back to the President, then, the President 87
has to give assent to that bill.  However, there is no mention in the
Constitution about the time limit within which the President must
send the bill back for reconsideration. This means that the President
can just keep the bill pending with him without any time limit. This
gives the President an informal power to use the veto in a very effective
manner. This is sometimes referred to as ‘pocket veto’.

Then, the third kind of discretion arises more out of political
circumstances. Formally, the President appoints the Prime Minister.
Normally, in the parliamentary system, a leader who has the support
of the majority in the Lok Sabha would be appointed as Prime
Minister and the question of discretion would not arise. But imagine
a situation when after an election, no leader has a clear majority in
the Lok Sabha. Imagine further that after attempts to forge alliances,
two or three leaders are claiming that they have the support of the
majority in the house. Now, the President has to decide whom to
appoint as the Prime Minister. In such a situation, the President has
to use his own discretion in judging who really may have the support
of the majority or who can actually form and run the government.

Since 1989 major political changes have considerably increased
the importance of the presidential office. In the four parliamentary
elections held from 1989 to 1998, no single party or coalition attained

President’s role in choosing the Prime Minister
After 1977, party politics in India became more competitive
and there have been many instances when no party had
clear majority in the Lok Sabha. What does the President do
in such situations? No political party or coalition secured
majority in the elections held in March 1998. The BJP and
its allies secured 251 seats, 21 short of a majority. President
Narayanan adopted an elaborate procedure. He asked the
leader of the alliance, Atal Behari Vajpayee, “to furnish
documents in support of his claim from concerned political
parties.” Not stopping at this the President also advised
Vajpayee to secure a vote of confidence within ten days of
being sworn in.

a majority in the Lok Sabha. These situations demanded presidential
intervention either in order to constitute governments or to grant a
request for dissolution of Lok Sabha by a Prime Minister who could
not prove majority in the House. It may thus be said that presidential
discretion is related to political conditions. There is greater scope for
presidential assertiveness when governments are not stable and
coalitions occupy power.

For the most part, the President is a formal power holder and a
ceremonial head of the nation. You may wonder why then do we
need a President? In a parliamentary system, the Council of Ministers
is dependent on the support of the majority in the legislature. This
also means that the Council of Ministers may be removed at any
time and a new Council of Ministers will have to be put in place.
Such a situation requires a Head of the state who has a fixed term,
who may be empowered to appoint the Prime Minister and who may
symbolically represent the entire country. This is exactly the role of
the President in ordinary circumstances. Besides, when no party
has a clear majority, the President has the additional responsibility
of making a choice and appointing the Prime Minister to run the
government of the country.

The Vice President of India
The Vice President is elected for five years. His election
method is similar to that of the President, the only
difference is that members of State legislatures are
not part of the electoral college. The Vice President
may be removed from his office by a resolution of the
Rajya Sabha passed by a majority and agreed to by
the Lok Sabha. The Vice President acts as the ex-
officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and takes over
the office of the President when there is a vacancy by
reasons of death, resignation, removal by
impeachment or otherwise. The Vice President acts
as the President only until a new President is elected.

who felt that ministers should be elected by the legislature
and not selected by the Prime Minister or Chief Minister:

Size of the Council of Ministers
Before the 91st Amendment Act (2003), the size of the Council
of Ministers was determined according to exigencies of time and
requirements of the situation. But this led to very large size of
the Council of Ministers. Besides, when no party had a clear
majority, there was a temptation to win over the support of the
members of the Parliament by giving them ministerial positions
as there was no restriction on the number of the members of
the Council of Ministers. This was happening in many States
also. Therefore, an amendment was made that the Council of
Ministers shall not exceed 15 percent of total number of members
of the House of the People (or Assembly, in the case of the States).

In the chapter on the legislature, you will study in detail the
various mechanisms through which the Parliament controls the
executive. But remember that the most important feature of
parliamentary executive is that the executive is routinely under the
control and supervision of the legislature.

The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok
Sabha. This provision means that a Ministry which loses confidence

of the Lok Sabha is obliged to resign. The principle
indicates that the ministry is an executive committee of
the Parliament and it collectively governs on behalf of the
Parliament. Collective responsibility is based on the
principle of the solidarity of the cabinet. It implies that a
vote of no confidence even against a single minister leads
to the resignation of the entire Council of Ministers. It also
indicates that if a minister does not agree with a policy or
decision of the cabinet, he or she must either accept the
decision or resign. It is binding on all ministers to pursue
or agree to a policy for which there is collective
responsibility.

In India, the Prime Minister enjoys a pre-eminent place
in the government.  The Council of Ministers cannot exist
without the Prime Minister. The Council comes into
existence only after the Prime Minister has taken the oath
of office. The death or resignation of the Prime Minister
automatically brings about the dissolution of the Council
of Ministers but the demise, dismissal or resignation of a
minister only creates a ministerial vacancy. The Prime
Minister acts as a link between the Council of Ministers
on the one hand and the President as well as the Parliament
on the other. It is this role of the Prime Minister which led
Pt. Nehru to describe him as ‘the linchpin of Government’.

governments in India. Many of these
governments could not remain in power for
the full term of the Lok Sabha. They were
either removed or they resigned due to loss

developments have affected the working of

In the first place, these developments
have resulted in a growing discretionary role
of the President in the selection of Prime
Ministers. Secondly, the coalitional nature

government cannot be decided by the Prime

both as pre-poll and post-poll allies to form a government. Policies
are framed after a lot of negotiations and compromises among the
allies. In this entire process, the Prime Minister has to act more as a
negotiator than as leader of the government.

with some variations. The most important variation is that there is a

PERMANENT EXECUTIVE: BUREAUCRACY

Who implements the decisions of the ministers?
The Executive organ of the government includes the Prime

Minister, the ministers and a large organisation called the
bureaucracy or the administrative machinery. To underline the
difference between this machinery and the military service, it is
described as civil service. Trained and skilled officers who work as
permanent employees of the government are assigned the task of
assisting the ministers in formulating policies and implementing these
policies.

In a democracy, the elected representatives and the ministers are
in charge of government and the administration is under their control
and supervision. In the parliamentary system, the legislature also
exercises control over the administration. The administrative officers

Chapter 4: Executive

machinery. At the same time, this machinery is made
politically accountable. The bureaucracy is also expected 95
to be politically neutral. This means that the bureaucracy
will not take any political position on policy matters. In a
democracy, it is always possible that a party is defeated
in elections and the new government wants to opt for new
policies in the place of policies of the previous government.
In such a situation, it is the responsibility of the
administrative machinery to faithfully and efficiently
participate in  drafting the policy and in its
implementation.

The Indian bureaucracy today is an enormously
complex system. It consists of the All-India services, State
services, employees of the local governments, and
technical and managerial staff running public sector
undertakings. Makers of our Constitution were aware of
the importance of the non-partisan and professional
bureaucracy. They also wanted the members of the civil
services or bureaucracy to be impartially selected on the
basis of merit. So, the Union Public Service Commission
has been entrusted with the task of conducting the process
of recruitment of the civil servants for the government of
India. Similar public service commissions are provided for
the States also. Members of the Public Service Commissions
are appointed for a fixed term. Their removal or suspension
is subject to a thorough enquiry made by a judge of the
Supreme Court.

While efficiency and merit are the norms for recruitment,
the Constitution also ensures that all sections of the society
including the weaker sections have an opportunity to be
part of the public bureaucracy. For this purpose, the
Constitution has provided reservation in jobs for Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Subsequently, reservations Yes, I know that the officers

Persons selected by the UPSC for Indian Administrative Service
and Indian Police Service constitute the backbone of the higher level
bureaucracy in the States. You may know that the collector of a district
is the most important officer of the government at the district level.
Do you know that the collector is normally an IAS officer and that
the officer is governed by the service conditions laid down by the
central government? An IAS or IPS officer is assigned to a particular
State, where he or she works under the supervision of the State
government. However, the IAS or IPS officers are appointed by the
central government, they can go back into the service of the central
government and most importantly, only the central government can
take disciplinary action against them. This means that the key
administrative officers of the States are under the supervision and
control of the central government. Apart from the IAS and the IPS
officers appointed by the UPSC, the administration of the State is
looked after by officers appointed through the State Public Service
Commissions. As we shall study later in the chapter on federalism,
this feature of the bureaucracy strengthens the control of the central
government over the administration of the States.

The bureaucracy is an instrument through which welfare policies
of the government must reach the people. But most often, it is so
powerful that people are afraid of approaching a government officer.
It is a common experience of the people that bureaucracy is
insensitive to the demands and expectations of the ordinary citizen.
Only if the democratically elected government controls the
bureaucracy, some of these problems can be effectively handled. On

It is also felt that enough provisions are not there to ensure the 97
accountability of the bureaucracy to the citizen. There is an
expectation that measures like the Right to Information may make
the bureaucracy a little more responsive and accountable.

Conclusion
The modern executive is a very powerful institution of
government. The executive enjoys greater powers compared to
other organs of the government. This generates a greater need
to have democratic control over the executive. The makers of
our Constitution thought with foresight that the executive must
be put firmly under regular supervision and control. Thus, a
parliamentary executive was chosen. Periodic elections,
constitutional limits over the exercise of powers and democratic
politics have ensured that executive organ cannot become
unresponsive.

Chapter 5: Legislature

WHY DO WE NEED A PARLIAMENT?
Legislature is not merely a law making body. Lawmaking is but one 101
of the functions of the legislature. It is the centre of all democratic
political process. It is packed with action; walkouts, protests,
demonstration, unanimity, concern and co-operation.  All these serve
very vital purposes. Indeed, a genuine democracy is inconceivable
without a representative, efficient and effective legislature. The
legislature also helps people in holding the representatives
accountable. This is indeed, the very basis of representative
democracy.

Yet, in most democracies, legislatures are losing central place to
the executive. In India too, the Cabinet initiates policies, sets the
agenda for governance and carries them through. This has led some
critics to remark that the Parliament has declined. But even very
strong cabinets must retain majority in the legislature. A strong leader
has to face the Parliament and answer to the satisfaction of the
Parliament. Herein lies the democratic potential of the Parliament. It
is recognised as one of the most democratic and open forum of debate.
On account of its composition, it is the most representative of all
organs of government. It is above all, vested with the power to choose
and dismiss the government.

constituted about 5 per cent rise in prices. The

WHY DO WE NEED TWO HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT?

The term ‘Parliament’ refers to the national legislature. The legislature

of the States is described as State legislature. The Parliament in India

has two houses. When there are two houses of the legislature, it is

called a bicameral legislature. The two Houses of the Indian

Parliament are the Council of States or the Rajya Sabha and the

102 House of the People or the Lok Sabha. The Constitution has given

the States the option of establishing either a unicameral or bicameral

legislature. At present only six States have a bicameral legislature.

Indian Constitution at Work

Countries with large size and much diversity usually prefer to
have two houses of the national legislature to give representation to
all sections in the society and to give representation to all geographical
regions or parts of the country. A bicameral legislature has one more
advantage. A bicameral legislature makes it possible to have every
decision reconsidered. Every decision taken by one house goes to
the other house for its decision. This means that every bill and policy
would be discussed twice. This ensures a double check on every
matter. Even if one house takes a decision in haste, that decision will
come for discussion in the other house and reconsideration will be
possible.

“...an Upper House could perform
the...useful function of being a
revising body, and ...its views may
count but not its votes... ...,those
who could not enter into the rough
and tumble of active politics
could...advise the Lower House.”

Purnima Banerji

Rajya Sabha
Each of the two Houses of Parliament has different bases of
representation. The Rajya Sabha represents the States of India. It is
an indirectly elected body. Residents of the State elect members to
State Legislative Assembly. The elected members of State Legislative
Assembly in turn elect the members of the Rajya Sabha.

We can imagine two different principles of representation in the

104 second chamber. One way is to give equal representation to all the
parts of the country irrespective of their size or population. We may

WHAT DOES THE PARLIAMENT DO?
What is the function of the legislature? Do both Houses of the
Parliament have similar functions? Is there a difference in the powers
of the two Houses?

Apart from law making, the Parliament is engaged in many other
functions. Let us list the functions of the Parliament:
± Legislative Function: The Parliament enacts legislations for the

country. Despite being the chief law making body, the Parliament
often merely approves legislations. The actual task of drafting
the bill is performed by the bureaucracy under the supervision
of the minister concerned.  The substance and even the timing of
the bill are decided by the Cabinet. No major bill is introduced in
the Parliament without the approval of the Cabinet. Members
other than ministers can also introduce bills but these have no
chance of being passed without the support of the government.

± Control of Executive and ensuring its accountability: Perhaps
the most vital function of the Parliament is to ensure that the
executive does not overstep its authority and remains responsible
to the people who have elected them. We shall discuss this function
in greater detail later in this chapter.

± Financial Function: Government is about spending a lot of money
on various matters. Where does this money come from? Every

Reprint 2025-26

government raises resources through taxation. However, in a

democracy, legislature controls taxation and the way in which

money is used by the government. If the Government of India

proposes to introduce any new tax, it has to get the approval of

the Lok Sabha. The financial powers of the Parliament involve

grant of resources to the government to implement its

programmes. The government has to give an account to the

legislature about the money it has spent and resources that it

wishes to raise. The legislature also ensures that the government

does not misspend or overspend. This is done through the budget

and annual financial statements.

The Parliament is the boss and the ministers are looking very

humble here. That is the effect of the Parliament’s power to

sanction money to different ministries.

± Representation: Parliament represents the divergent views of

members from different regional, social, economic, religious

groups of different parts of the country.

± Debating Function: The Parliament is the highest forum of debate

in the country. There is no limitation on its power of discussion.
108 Members are free to speak on any matter without fear. This makes

it possible for the Parliament to analyse any or every issue that

faces the nation.  These discussions constitute the heart of

democratic decision making.

functions. It elects the President and Vice President of India.

Special Powers of Rajya Sabha
As you know, the Rajya Sabha is an institutional
mechanism to provide representation to the States. Its
purpose is to protect the powers of the States. Therefore,
any matter that affects the States must be referred to it for
its consent and approval. Thus, if the Union Parliament
wishes to remove a matter from the State list (over which
only the State Legislature can make law) to either the Union
List or Concurrent List in the interest of the nation, the
approval of the Rajya Sabha is necessary. This provision
adds to the strength of the Rajya Sabha. However,
experience shows that the members of the Rajya Sabha
represent their parties more than they represent their
States.

Powers exercised only by the Lok Sabha:  Then, there
are powers that only the Lok Sabha exercises. The Rajya
Sabha cannot initiate, reject or amend money bills. The
Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lok Sabha and
not Rajya Sabha. Therefore, Rajya Sabha can criticise the
government but cannot remove it.

Can you explain why? The Rajya Sabha is elected by
the MLAs and not directly by the people. Therefore, the
Constitution stopped short of giving certain powers to the
Rajya Sabha. In a democratic form as adopted by our
Constitution, the people are the final authority. By this
logic, the representatives, directly elected by the people,
should have the crucial powers of removing a government
and controlling the finances.

bills, constitutional amendments, and impeaching the

A bill is a draft of the proposed law. There can be different types of
bills. When a non-minister proposes a bill, it is called private member’s
Bill. A bill proposed by a minister is described as Government Bill.  Let
us now see the different stages in the life of a bill.

Amendment Bill

Even before a bill is introduced in the Parliament there may be a
lot of debate on the need for introducing such a bill. A political party
may pressurise the government to initiate a bill in order to fulfil its
election promises or to improve its chances of winning forthcoming
elections. Interest groups, media and citizens’ forums may also
persuade the government for a particular legislation. Law making is
thus not merely a legal procedure but also a political course of action.

112 The preparation of a bill itself involves many considerations such as
resources required to implement the law, the support or opposition
that the bill is likely to produce, the impact that the law may have on

the electoral prospect of the ruling party etc. In the era of coalition
politics especially, a bill proposed by the government has to be 113
acceptable to all the partners of the coalition. Such practical
considerations can hardly be ignored. The Cabinet considers all these
before arriving at a decision to enact a law.

Once the Cabinet approves the policy behind the legislation, the
task of drafting the legislation begins. The draft of any bill is prepared
by the concerned ministry. For instance a bill raising the marriageable
age of girls from 18 to 21 will be prepared by the law ministry. The
ministry of women and child welfare may also be involved in it.
Within the Parliament, a bill may be introduced in the Lok Sabha or
Rajya Sabha by a member of the House (but often a minister
responsible for the subject introduces the bill). A money bill can be
introduced only in Lok Sabha. Once passed there, it is sent to the
Rajya Sabha.

A large part of the discussion on the bills takes place in the
committees. The recommendation of the committee is then sent to the
House. That is why committees are referred to as
miniature legislatures. This is the second stage in
the law making process. In the third and final stage, READ A CARTOON
the bill is voted upon. If a non-money bill is passed
by one House, it is sent to the other House where it
goes through exactly the same procedure.

As you know, a bill has to be passed by both
Houses for enactment. If there is disagreement
between the two Houses on the proposed bill,
attempt is made to resolve it through Joint Session
of Parliament. In the few instances when joint
sessions of the parliament were called to resolve a
deadlock, the decision has always gone in favour of
the Lok Sabha.

If it is a money bill, the Rajya Sabha can either
approve the bill or suggest changes but cannot reject
it. If it takes no action within 14 days the bill is
deemed to have been passed. Amendments to the
bill, suggested by Rajya Sabha, may or may not be Is this how they follow

HOW DOES THE PARLIAMENT CONTROL THE EXECUTIVE?
In a parliamentary democracy, the executive is drawn from the party
or a coalition of parties that has a majority in Lok Sabha. It is not
difficult for the executive to exercise unlimited and arbitrary powers
with the support of the majority party. In such a situation,
parliamentary democracy may slip into Cabinet dictatorship, where
the Cabinet leads and the House merely follows.  Only if the Parliament
is active and vigilant, can it keep regular and effective check on the

114 executive. There are many ways in which the Parliament can control
the executive. But basic to them all is the power and freedom of the
legislators as people’s representatives to work effectively and
fearlessly. For instance, no action can be taken against a member for

Reprint 2025-26



Chapter 5: Legislature

whatever the member may have said in the legislature.
This is known as parliamentary privilege. The presiding 115
officer of the legislature has the final powers in deciding
matters of breach of privilege.

The main purpose of such privileges is to enable the
members of the legislature to represent the people and
exercise effective control over the executive. How does the
Parliament exercise such control? What are the means
available at its disposal? Is parliamentary control
successful in curbing executive excesses?

Instruments of Parliamentary Control
The legislature in parliamentary system ensures executive
accountability at various stages: policy making,
implementation of law or policy and during and post-
implementation stage. The legislature does this through
the use of a variety of devices:

± Deliberation and discussion
± Approval or Refusal of laws
± Financial control
± No confidence motion
Deliberation and discussion: During the law making

process, members of the legislature get an opportunity to
deliberate on the policy direction of the executive and the
ways in which policies are implemented. Apart from
deliberating on bills, control may also be exercised during
the general discussions in the House. The Question Hour,
which is held every day during the sessions of Parliament,
where Ministers have to respond to searching questions
raised by the members; Zero Hour where members are
free to raise any matter that they think is important
(though the ministers are not bound to reply),
half-an-hour discussion on matters of public importance,
adjournment motion, etc., are some instruments of
exercising control.

Perhaps the question hour is the most effective method With so many sting operations

shown great interest in question hour and maximum
attendance is recorded during this time. Most of the
questions aim at eliciting information from the government
on issues of public interest such as, price rise, availability
of food grains, atrocities on weaker sections of the society,
riots, black-marketing, etc. This gives the members an

examination almost every day! to see members raise their voice, walk to the well of the
house or walk out in protest to make their point. This
results in considerable loss of legislative time. At the same
time, we must remember that many of these actions are
political techniques to gain concessions from government
and in the process force executive accountability.

Approval and ratification of laws: Parliamentary
control is also exercised through its power of ratification.
A bill can become a law only with the approval of the
Parliament. A government that has the support of a
disciplined majority may not find it difficult to get the
approval of the Legislature. Such approvals however,
cannot be taken for granted. They are the products of
intense bargaining and negotiations amongst the
members of ruling party or coalition of parties and even
government and opposition. If the government has
majority in Lok Sabha but not in the Rajya Sabha, as has
happened during the Janata Party rule in 1977 and
N.D.A. rule in 2000, the government will be forced to make
substantial concessions to gain the approval of both the
Houses. Many bills, such as the Lok Pal Bill have failed
enactment, Prevention of Terrorism bill (2002) was rejected
by the Rajya Sabha.

Financial control: As mentioned earlier, financial
resources to implement the programmes of the

116 government are granted through the budget. Preparation
and presentation of budget for the approval of the
legislature is constitutional obligation of the government.
This obligation allows the legislature to exercise control

Reprint 2025-26



Chapter 5: Legislature

over the purse strings of the government. The legislature may refuse
to grant resources to the government. This seldom happens because 117
the government ordinarily enjoys support of the majority in the
parliamentary system. Nevertheless, before granting money the Lok
Sabha can discuss the reasons for which the government requires
money. It can enquire into cases of misuse of funds on the basis of
the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Public
Accounts committees. But the legislative control is not only aimed at
financial propriety. The legislature is concerned about the policies of
the government that are reflected in the budget. Through financial
control, the legislature controls the policy of the government.

No Confidence Motion: The most powerful weapon that enables
the Parliament to ensure executive accountability is the no-confidence
motion. As long as the government has the support of its party or
coalition of parties that have a majority in the Lok Sabha, the power
of the House to dismiss the government is fictional rather than real.
However, after 1989, several governments have been forced to resign
due to lack of confidence of the house. Each of these governments
lost the confidence of the Lok Sabha because they failed to retain the
support of their coalition partners.

Thus, the Parliament can effectively control the executive and
ensure a more responsive government. It is however important for
this purpose, that there is adequate time at the disposal of the House,
the members are interested in discussion and participate effectively
and there is willingness to compromise amongst the government and
the opposition. In the last two decades, there has been a gradual

WHAT DO THE COMMITTEES OF

PARLIAMENT DO?
A significant feature of the legislative process
is the appointment of committees for various
legislative purposes. These committees play a
vital role not merely in law making, but also in
the day-to-day business of the House. Since
the Parliament meets only during sessions, it
has very limited time at its disposal. The
making of law for instance requires in-depth
study of the issue under consideration. This
in turn demands more attention and time.
Similarly, there are other important functions
also, like studying the demands for grants
made by various ministries, looking into
expenditure incurred by various departments,
investigating cases of corruption etc.

from both Houses.

The committee system has reduced the burden on the
Parliament. Many important bills have been referred to
committees. The Parliament has merely approved the work
done in the committees with few occasional alterations.
Of course legally speaking, no bill can become law, and
no budget will be sanctioned unless approved by the
Parliament. But the Parliament rarely rejects the
suggestions made by the committees.

HOW DOES THE PARLIAMENT REGULATE ITSELF?
Parliament as mentioned earlier is a debating forum. It is
through debates that the parliament performs all its vital
functions. Such discussions must be meaningful and
orderly so that the functions of the Parliament are carried
out smoothly and its dignity is intact. The Constitution
itself has made certain provisions to ensure smooth

“We are not walking out, we have been ordered out,” said the MPs.
Why do you think such situations occur?

There is one more way in which the presiding officers
control the behaviour of the members. You may have
heard about the anti-defection law. Most of the members
of the legislatures are elected on the ticket of some political
party. What would happen if they decide to leave the party
after getting elected? For many years after independence,

What is defection? If a member remains absent in the House when
asked by the party leadership to remain present or votes against the
instructions of the party or voluntarily leaves the membership of the
party, it is deemed as defection.

Experience of the past twenty years shows that the anti-defection
amendment has not been able to curb defections, but it has given
additional powers to the party leadership and the presiding officers

Conclusion
Have you watched the live telecast of the proceeding of the
Parliament? You will find that our Parliament is truly a rainbow
of colourful dresses symbolising different regions of the country.
Members speak different languages in the course of the
proceedings. They come from various castes, religions and sects.
They often fight bitterly. Many times an impression is created
that they are wasting the time and money of the nation.  But we
have seen in this chapter that these same parliamentarians
can effectively control the executive. They can express the
interests of various sections of our society. On account of its
composition, Legislature is the most representative of all organs
of government. The sheer presence of members of diverse social
backgrounds makes the legislatures more representative and
potentially more responsive to people’s expectations.  In a
parliamentary democracy, legislature, as a body representing
the wishes of the people occupies a high position of power and
responsibility. Herein lies the democratic potential of the
Parliament.

JUDICIARY

INTRODUCTION

Many times, courts are seen only as arbitrators in disputes between individuals
or private parties. But judiciary performs some political functions also. Judiciary
is an important organ of the government. The Supreme Court of India is in fact,
one of the very powerful courts in the world. Right from 1950 the judiciary has
played an important role in interpreting and in protecting the Constitution. In
this chapter you will  study the role and importance of the judiciary.  In the
chapter on fundamental rights you have already read that the judiciary is very
important for protecting our rights. After studying this chapter, you would be

Chapter 6: Judiciary

WHY DO WE NEED AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY?
In any society, disputes are bound to arise between individuals, 125
between groups and between individuals or groups and government.
All such disputes must be settled by an independent body in
accordance with the principle of rule of law. This idea of rule of law
implies that all individuals — rich and poor, men or women, forward
or backward castes — are subjected to the same law. The principal
role of the judiciary is to protect rule of law and ensure supremacy
of law. It safeguards rights of the individual, settles disputes in
accordance with the law and ensures that democracy does not give
way to individual or group
dictatorship. In order to be able to do
all this, it is necessary that the

like the executive and legislature

of the judiciary in such a way that
it is unable to do justice.

person must have experience as a lawyer and/or must be
well versed in law. Political opinions of the person or his/
her political loyalty should not be the criteria for
appointments to judiciary.

The judges have a fixed tenure. They hold office till
reaching the age of retirement. Only in exceptional cases,
judges may be removed. But otherwise, they have security
of tenure. Security of tenure ensures that judges could
function without fear or favour. The Constitution
prescribes a very difficult procedure for removal of judges.
The Constitution makers believed that a difficult
procedure of removal would provide security of office to
the members of judiciary.

The judiciary is not financially dependent on either
the executive or legislature. The Constitution provides that
the salaries and allowances of the judges are not subjected
to the approval of the legislature. The actions and
decisions of the judges are immune from personal
criticisms. The judiciary has the power to penalise those
who are found guilty of contempt of court. This authority
of the court is seen as an effective protection to the judges
from unfair criticism. Parliament cannot discuss the
conduct of the judges except when the proceeding  to

126 remove a judge is being carried out. This gives the
judiciary independence to adjudicate without fear of being
criticised.

Appointment of Judges
The appointment of judges has never been free from
political controversy. It is part of the political process. It
makes a difference who serves in the Supreme Court and
High Court— a difference in how the Constitution is
interpreted. The political philosophy of the judges, their
views about active and assertive judiciary or controlled
and committed judiciary have an impact on the fate of the
legislations enacted. Council of Ministers, Governors and
Chief Ministers and Chief Justice of India — all influence
the process of judicial appointment.

The other Judges of the Supreme Court and the High

matters of appointment rested with the Council of

making recommendations for appointments. At the
moment therefore, in matters of appointment the decision
of the group of senior judges of the Supreme Court carries
greater weight. Thus, in matters of appointment to the
judiciary, the Supreme Court and the Council of Ministers
play an important role.

Removal of Judges
The removal of judges of the Supreme Court and the High
Courts is also extremely difficult. A judge of the Supreme
Court or High Court can be removed only on the ground
of proven misbehaviour or incapacity. A motion
containing the charges against the judge must be
approved by special majority in both Houses of the
Parliament. Do you remember what special majority
means? We have studied this in the chapter on Elections.
It is clear from this procedure that removal of a judge is a
very difficult procedure and unless there is a general

128 consensus among Members of the Parliament, a judge
cannot be removed. It should also be noted that while in
making appointments, the executive plays a crucial role;

both balance of power and independence of the judiciary. So far,
only one case of removal of a judge of the Supreme Court came up 129
for consideration before Parliament. In that case, though the motion
got two-thirds majority, it did not have the support of the majority of
the total strength of the House and therefore, the judge was not
removed.

Unsuccessful Attempt to Remove a Judge
In 1991 the first-ever motion to remove a Supreme Court
Justice was signed by 108 members of Parliament. Justice
V. Ramaswami, during his tenure as the Chief Justice of
the Punjab and Haryana High Court was accused of
misappropriating funds. In 1992, a year after Parliament
had started the removal proceedings, a high-profile inquiry
commission consisting of Judges of the Supreme Court
found Justice V. Ramaswami “guilty of wilful and gross
misuses of office . . . and moral turpitude by using public
funds for private purposes and reckless disregard of
statutory rules” while serving as the Chief Justice of the
Punjab and Haryana High Court. Despite this strong
indictment, Ramaswami survived the parliamentary
motion recommending removal. The motion
recommending his removal got the required two-thirds
majority among the members who were present and voting,
but the Congress party abstained from voting in the
House. Therefore, the motion could not get the support of
one-half of the total strength of the House.

STRUCTURE OF THE JUDICIARY

The Constitution of India provides for a single integrated judicial
system. This means that unlike some other federal countries of the
world, India does not have separate State courts. The structure of
the judiciary in India is pyramidal with the Supreme Court at the
top, High Courts below them and district and subordinate courts at
the lowest level (see the diagram below). The lower courts function
under the direct superintendence of the higher courts.

Original Jurisdiction
Original jurisdiction means cases that can be directly considered by
the Supreme Court without going to the lower courts before that.
From the diagram above, you will notice that cases involving federal
relations go directly to the Supreme Court. The Original Jurisdiction
of the Supreme Court establishes it as an umpire in all disputes
regarding federal matters.  In any federal country, legal disputes are
bound to arise between the Union and the States; and among the
States themselves. The power to resolve such cases is entrusted to
the Supreme Court of India. It is called original jurisdiction because
the Supreme Court alone has the power to deal with such cases.
Neither the High Courts nor the lower courts can deal with such
cases. In this capacity, the Supreme Court not just settles disputes
but also interprets the powers of Union and State government as
laid down in the Constitution.

Writ Jurisdiction
As you have already studied in the chapter on fundamental rights,
any individual, whose fundamental right has been violated, can
directly move the Supreme Court for remedy. The Supreme Court
can give special orders in the form of writs. The High Courts can also
issue writs, but the persons whose rights are violated have the choice
of either approaching the High Court or approaching the Supreme
Court directly. Through such writs, the Court can give orders to the
executive to act or not to act in a particular way.

Appellate Jurisdiction
The Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal. A person can
appeal to the Supreme Court against the decisions of the High Court.
However, High Court must certify that the case is fit for appeal, that
is to say that it involves a serious matter of interpretation of law or
Constitution. In addition, in criminal cases, if the lower court has
sentenced a person to death then an appeal can be made to the High
Court or Supreme Court. Of course, the Supreme Court holds the

132 powers to decide whether to admit appeals even when appeal is not
allowed by the High Court. Appellate jurisdiction means that the
Supreme Court will reconsider the case and the legal issues involved

in it. If the Court thinks that the law  or the Constitution
has a different meaning from what the lower courts 133
understood, then the Supreme Court will change the
ruling and along with that also give new interpretation of
the provision involved.

The High Courts too, have appellate jurisdiction over
the decisions given by courts below them.

Advisory Jurisdiction
In addition to original and appellate jurisdiction, the
Supreme Court of India possesses advisory jurisdiction
also. This means that the President of India can refer any
matter that is of public importance or that which involves
interpretation of Constitution to Supreme Court for advice.
However, the Supreme Court is not bound to give advice
on such matters and the President is not bound to accept
such an advice.

What then is the utility of the advisory powers of the
Supreme Court? The utility is two-fold. In the first place,
it allows the government to seek legal opinion on a matter
of importance before taking action on it. This may prevent
unnecessary litigations later. Secondly, in the light of the
advice of the Supreme Court, the government can make
suitable changes in its action or legislations.

READ  A CARTOON 135

Do you know that in recent times the judiciary has ruled that
bandhs and hartals are illegal?

The chief instrument through which judicial activism has
flourished in India is Public Interest Litigation (PIL) or Social Action
Litigation (SAL). What is PIL or SAL? How and when did it emerge?
In normal course of law, an individual can approach the courts only
if he/she has been personally aggrieved. That is to say, a person
whose rights have been violated, or who is involved in a dispute,
could move the court of law.  This concept underwent a change
around 1979. In 1979, the Court set the trend when it decided to
hear a case where the case was filed not by the aggrieved persons
but by others on their behalf. As this case involved a consideration
of an issue of public interest, it and such other cases came to be
known as public interest litigations. Around the same time, the
Supreme Court also took up the case about rights of prisoners. This
opened the gates for large number of cases where public spirited
citizens and voluntary organisations sought judicial intervention for
protection of existing rights, betterment of life conditions of the poor,

protection of the environment, and many other issues in
the interest of the public. PIL has become the most
important vehicle of judicial activism.

Judiciary, which is an institution that traditionally
confined to responding to cases brought before it, began
considering many cases merely on the basis of newspaper
reports and postal complaints received by the court.
Therefore, the term judicial activism became the more
popular description of the role of the judiciary.

I have heard someone say that Some Early PILs

PIL means ‘private interest ± In 1979, newspapers published reports about

litigation’. Why would that ‘under trials’. There were many prisoners in
Bihar who had spent long years in jail, longer

be so?
than what they would have spent if they had
been punished for the offences for which they
were arrested. This report prompted an
advocate to file a petition. The Supreme Court
heard this case. It became famous as one of
the early Public Interest Litigations (PILs). This
was the Hussainara  Khatoon vs. Bihar case.

± In 1980, a prison inmate of the Tihar jail
managed to send a scribbled piece of paper to
Justice Krishna Iyer of the Supreme Court
narrating physical torture of the prisoners.
The judge got it converted into a petition.
Though later on, the Court abandoned the
practice of considering letters, this case,
known as Sunil Batra vs. Delhi Administration
(1980) also became one of the pioneers of
public interest litigation.

Through the PIL, the court has expanded the idea of
rights. Clean air, unpolluted water, decent living, etc., are
rights for the entire society. Therefore, it was felt by the
courts that individuals as parts of the society must have

136 the right to seek justice wherever such rights were violated.
Secondly, through PIL and judicial activism of the

post-1980 period, the judiciary has also shown readiness
to take into consideration rights of those sections who

cannot easily approach the courts. For this purpose, the
judiciary allowed public spirited citizens, social 137
organisations and lawyers to file petitions on behalf of the
needy and the deprived.

It must be remembered that the problems of
the poor …are qualitatively different from those which
have hitherto occupied the attention of the Court and
they need ….a different kind of judicial approach. If
we blindly follow the adversarial procedure in their
case, they would never be able to enforce their
fundamental rights. — Justice Bhagwati in Bandhua

Judicial activism has had manifold impact on the
political system. It has democratised the judicial system
by giving not just to individuals but also groups access
to the courts. It has forced executive accountability. It
has also made an attempt to make the electoral system
much more free and fair.  The court asked candidates
contesting elections to file affidavits indicating their assets
and income along with educational qualifications so that
the people could elect their representatives based on
accurate knowledge.

There is however a negative side to the large number
of PILs and the idea of a proactive judiciary. In the first I think judicial activism is more

instance, reducing air or sound pollution or investigating cases of
corruption or bringing about electoral reform is not exactly the duty
of the Judiciary. These are matters to be handled by the
administration under the supervision of the legislatures. Therefore,
some people feel that judicial activism has made the balance among
the three organs of government very delicate. Democratic government
is based on each organ of government respecting the powers and
jurisdiction of the others. Judicial activism may be creating strains
on this democratic principle.

YOU ARE THE JUDGE

A group of citizens from a city have
approached the court through a PIL
asking for an order to the city municipal
authorities to remove slums and
beautify the city in order to attract
investors to the city. They argue that
this is in the ‘public interest.’ The
residents of the slum localities have
responded by saying that this will
encroach on their right to life. They
argue that right to life is more central
to ‘public interest’ than the right to a
clean city.

JUDICIARY AND RIGHTS

We have already seen that the judiciary is entrusted with the task of
protecting rights of individuals. The Constitution provides two ways
in which the Supreme Court can remedy the violation of rights.
± First it can restore fundamental rights by issuing writs of Habeas

Chapter 6: Judiciary

Together these two provisions of the Constitution
establish the Supreme Court as the protector of 139
fundamental rights of the citizen on the one hand and
interpreter of Constitution on the other.  The second of
the two ways mentioned above involves judicial review.

Perhaps the most important power of the Supreme
Court is the power of judicial review. Judicial Review
means the power of the Supreme Court (or High Courts)
to examine the constitutionality of any law if the Court
arrives at the conclusion that the law is inconsistent with
the provisions of the Constitution, such a law is declared
as unconstitutional and inapplicable. The term judicial
review is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution. However,
the fact that India has a written constitution and the
Supreme Court can strike down a law that goes against
fundamental rights, implicitly gives the Supreme Court
the power of judicial review.

Besides, as we saw in the section on jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court, in the case of federal relations too, the
Supreme Court can use the review powers if a law is
inconsistent with the distribution of powers laid down by
the Constitution. Suppose, the central government makes
a law, which according to some States, concerns a subject
from the State list. Then the States can go to the Supreme
Court and if the court agrees with them, it would declare
that the law is unconstitutional. In this sense, the review
power of the Supreme Court includes power to review
legislations on the ground that they violate fundamental
rights or on the ground that they violate the federal
distribution of powers. The review power extends to the
laws passed by State legislatures also.

Together, the writ powers and the review power of the
Court make judiciary very powerful. In particular, the
review power means that the judiciary can interpret the
Constitution and the laws passed by the legislature. Many
people think that this feature enables the judiciary to I think I’d rather become a

Did you know that the practice of public interest litigation is now
becoming more and more acceptable in many other countries?
While many courts across the world, particularly in South Asia
and Africa practice some form of judicial activism comparable to
that of the Indian judiciary, the constitution of South Africa has
incorporated public interest litigation in its bill of rights. Thus,
in South Africa, it is a fundamental right of the citizen to bring
before the Constitutional Court, cases of violation of other persons’
rights.

Do you remember that in the chapter on rights we mentioned the
right against exploitation? This right prohibits forced labour, trade
in human flesh and prohibits employment of children in hazardous
jobs. But the question is: how could those, whose rights were violated,
approach the court? PIL and judicial activism made it possible for
courts to consider these violations. Thus, the court considered a whole
set of cases: the blinding of the jail inmates by the police, inhuman
working conditions in stone quarries, sexual exploitation of children,
and so on. This trend has made rights really meaningful for the poor
and disadvantaged sections.

JUDICIARY AND PARLIAMENT

Apart from taking a very active stand on the matter of rights, the
court has been active in seeking to prevent subversion of the

140 Constitution through political practice. Thus, areas that were
considered beyond the scope of judicial review such as powers of the
President and Governor were brought under the purview of the
courts.

Chapter 6: Judiciary

There are many other instances in which the Supreme Court
actively involved itself in the administration of justice by giving 141
directions to executive agencies. Thus, it gave directions to CBI to
initiate investigations against politicians and bureaucrats in the
hawala case, the Narasimha Rao case, illegal allotment of petrol
pumps case etc. You may have heard about some of these cases.
Many of these instances are the products of judicial activism.

The Indian Constitution is based on a delicate principle of limited
separation of powers and checks and balances. This means that each
organ of the government has a clear area of functioning. Thus, the
Parliament is supreme in making laws and amending the
Constitution, the executive is supreme in implementing them while
the judiciary is supreme in settling disputes and deciding whether
the laws that have been made are in accordance with the provisions
of the Constitution. Despite such clear cut division of power the
conflict between the Parliament and judiciary, and executive and
the judiciary has remained a recurrent theme in Indian politics.

We have already mentioned the differences that emerged between
the Parliament and the judiciary over right to property and the
Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution. Let us recapitulate
that briefly:

Immediately after the implementation of the Constitution began,
a controversy arose over the Parliament’s power to restrict right to
property. The Parliament wanted to put some restrictions on the
right to hold property so that land reforms could be implemented.
The Court held that the Parliament cannot thus restrict fundamental
rights. The Parliament then tried to amend the Constitution. But the
Court said that even through an amendment, a fundamental right
cannot be abridged.

The following issues were at the centre of the controversy between
the Parliament and the judiciary.
± What is the scope of right to private property?
± What is the scope of the Parliament’s power to curtail, abridge or

abrogate fundamental rights?
± What is the scope of the Parliament’s power to amend the

constitution?
± Can the Parliament make laws that abridge fundamental rights

while enforcing directive principles?

Indian Constitution at Work

“While there can be no two opinions
on the need for the maintenance of
judicial independence, ...it is also
necessary to keep in view one
important principle. The doctrine of
independence is not to be raised to
the level of a dogma so as to enable
the judiciary to function as a kind
of super-legislature or super -
executive. The judiciary is there to
interpret the Constitution or
adjudicate upon the rights...”

Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar, CAD, Vol. XI, p. 837, 23 November 1949

During the period 1967 and 1973, this controversy became very
serious. Apart from land reform laws, laws enforcing preventive
detention, laws governing reservations in jobs, regulations acquiring
private property for public purposes, and laws deciding the
compensation for such acquisition of private property were some
instances of the conflict between the legislature and the judiciary.

In 1973, the Supreme Court gave a decision that has become
very important in regulating the relations between the Parliament
and the Judiciary since then. This case is famous as the Kesavananda
Bharati case. In this case, the Court ruled that there is a basic
structure of the Constitution and nobody—not even the Parliament
(through amendment)—can violate the basic structure. The Court
did two more things. First, it said that right to property (the disputed
issue) was not part of basic structure and therefore could be suitably
abridged. Secondly, the Court reserved to itself the right to decide
whether various matters are part of the basic structure of the
Constitution. This case is perhaps the best example of how judiciary

142 uses its power to interpret the Constitution.
This ruling has changed the nature of conflicts between the

legislature and the judiciary. As we studied earlier, the right to
property was taken away from the list of fundamental rights in 1979

and this also helped in changing the nature of the
relationship between these two organs of government. 143

Some issues still remain a bone of contention between
the two — can the judiciary intervene in and regulate the
functioning of the legislatures? In the parliamentary
system, the legislature has the power to govern itself and
regulate the behaviour of its members. Thus, the
legislature can punish a person who the legislature holds
guilty of breaching privileges of the legislature. Can a
person who is held guilty for breach of parliamentary
privileges seek protection of the courts? Can a member of
the legislature against whom the legislature has taken
disciplinary action get protection from the court? These
issues are unresolved and are matters of potential conflict
between the two. Similarly, the Constitution provides that Why can’t the Court tell us once

on the functioning of the judiciary. Similarly, the judiciary
too has criticised the legislatures and issued instructions
to the legislatures about the conduct of legislative
business. The legislatures see this as violating the principle
of parliamentary sovereignty.

These issues indicate how delicate the balance between
any two organs of the government is and how important
it is for each organ of the government in a democracy to
respect the authority of others.

Centre, Delhi join hands on CNG issue
By Our Staff Reporter, The Hindu 23 September 2001
NEW DELHI, SEPT. 22. The Centre and the Delhi Government
today agreed to jointly approach the Supreme Court this coming
week… for phasing out of all non-CNG commercial vehicles in
the Capital. They also decided to seek a dual fuel policy for the
city instead of putting the entire transportation system on the
single-fuel mode “which was full of dangers and would result in
disaster.’’

It was also decided to discourage the use of CNG by private
vehicle owners in the Capital. Both governments would press for
allowing the use of 0.05 per cent low sulphur diesel for running of
buses in the Capital. In addition, it would be pleaded before the
Court that all commercial vehicles, which fulfil the Euro-II
standards, should be allowed to ply in the city. Though both the
Centre and the State would file separate affidavits, these would
contain common points. The Centre would also go out and support
the Delhi Government’s stand on the issues concerning CNG.

These decisions were taken at a meeting between the Delhi Chief

Ms. Dikshit said the Central Government would request the

court that in view of the high powered Committee appointed under

Dr. R.A. Mashelkar to suggest an “Auto Fuel Policy”’ for the entire

not possible to convert the entire 10,000-odd bus fleet into CNG

expected to submit its report within a period of six months.

The Chief Minister said time was required to implement the

court directives. Referring to the coordinated approach on the

issue, Ms. Dikshit said this would take into account the details

about the number of vehicles to be run on CNG, eliminating long

queues outside CNG filling stations, the CNG fuel requirements

of Delhi and the ways and means to implement the directive of

the court.

The Supreme Court had …refused to relax the only CNG norm

for the city’s buses but said it had never insisted on CNG for

taxis and auto rickshaws. Mr. Naik said the Centre would insist

FEDERALISM

INTRODUCTION

Look at the political maps (on next two pages) of India 1947 and 2017. They
have changed dramatically over the years. Boundaries of States have changed,
names of States have changed, and the number of States has changed. When
India  became independent ,  we had a  number  of  provinces  that  the  Brit i sh
government had organised only for administrative convenience. Then a number
of  pr ince ly  states  merged with the  newly independent  Indian union.  These
were joined to the existing provinces. This is what you see in the first map.
Since then boundaries of States have been reorganised many times. During this
entire period, not only did boundaries of States change, but in some cases, even
their names changed according to the wishes of the people of those States. Thus,
Mysore changed to Karnataka and Madras became Tamil  Nadu. The maps show
these large scale changes that have taken place in the span of over seventy years.
In a way, these maps also tell us the story of functioning of federalism in India.

After studying this chapter you will be able to understand the following:

± the federal provisions in the Indian Constitution;
± the issues involved  in the relations between the centre and the States; and

India is a land of continental proportions and immense
diversities. There are more than 20 major languages and
several hundred minor ones. It is the home of several major
religions. There are several million indigenous peoples
living in different parts of the country. In spite of all these
diversities we share a common land mass. We have also
participated in a common history, especially, when we
fought for independence. We also share many other
important features. This has led our national leaders to
visualise India as a country where there is unity in
diversity. Sometimes it is described as unity with diversity.

Federalism does not consist of a set of fixed principles,
which are applied, to different historical situations. Rather,
federalism as a principle of government has evolved
differently in different situations. American federalism –
one of the first major attempts to build a federal polity – is
different from German or Indian federalism. But there are
also a few key ideas and concepts associated with
federalism.
± Essentially, federalism is an institutional mechanism

to accommodate two sets of polities—one at the
regional level and the other at the national level. Each
government is autonomous in its own sphere. In some
federal countries, there is even a system of dual

Federalism in Nigeria
If the regions and various communities do not trust each
other, even a federal arrangement can fail to produce unity.
The example of Nigeria is instructive:

Till 1914, Northern and Southern Nigeria were two
separate British colonies. At the Ibadan Constitutional
Conference of 1950 Nigerian leaders decided to form a
federal constitution.  The three major ethnic groups of
Nigeria—Yoruba, Ibo and Hausa-Fulani—controlled the
regions of the West, the East and the North respectively.
Their attempt to spread their influence to other regions
led to fears and conflicts. These led to a military regime.
In the 1960 constitution, both federal and regional
governments jointly controlled the Nigerian police. In the
military-supervised constitution of 1979, no state was
allowed to have any civil police.

Though democracy was restored in Nigeria in 1999,
religious differences along with conflicts over who will
control revenues from the oil resources continue to present
problems before the Nigerian federation. Local ethnic
communities resist centralised control of the oil resources.
Thus, Nigeria is an example of overlap of religious, ethnic
and economic differences among the units.

FEDERALISM IN THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION

Even before Independence, most leaders of our national 157
movement were aware that to govern a large country like
ours, it would be necessary to divide the powers between
provinces and the central government. There was also
awareness that Indian society had regional diversity and
linguistic diversity. This diversity needed recognition.
People of different regions and languages had to share
power and in each region, people of that region should
govern themselves. This was only logical if we wanted a
democratic government.

The only question was what should be the extent of
powers to be enjoyed by the regional governments. In view

decided to frame a government that would be based on
the principles of unity and cooperation between the centre
and the States and separate powers to the States. The
most important feature of the federal system adopted by
the Indian Constitution is the principle that relations
between the States and the centre would be based on
cooperation. Thus, while recognising diversity, the
Constitution emphasised unity.

FEDERALISM WITH A STRONG CENTRAL GOVERNMENT

It is generally accepted that the Indian Constitution has created a
strong central government. India is a country of continental
dimensions with immense diversities and social problems. The
framers of the Constitution believed that we required a federal
constitution that would accommodate diversities. But they also
wanted to create a strong centre to stem disintegration and bring
about social and political change. It was necessary for the centre to
have such powers because India at the time of independence was
not only divided into provinces created by the British; but there were
more than 500 princely states which had to be integrated into existing
States or new States had to be created.

“Let me tell my honourable Friends
in the House that the drift… in all
constitutions has been towards the
centre... because of circumstances
that have now come into being
that the States have become,
...federal or unitary, welfare states
from being Police States and the
ultimate responsibility as for the
economic well-being of the country
has become the paramount
responsibility of the centre.”

T.T. Krishnamachari, CAD, Vol. XI, p. 955-956, 25 November 1949

Besides the concern for unity, the makers of the Constitution
also believed that the socio-economic problems of the country needed
to be handled by a strong central government in cooperation with
the States. Poverty, illiteracy and inequalities of wealth were some of
the problems that required planning and coordination. Thus, the

160 concerns for unity and development prompted the makers of the
Constitution to create a strong central government.

Let us look at the important provisions that create a strong central
government:

CONFLICTS IN INDIA’S FEDERAL SYSTEM

In the previous section, we have seen that the Constitution has vested
very strong powers in the centre. Thus, the Constitution recognises
the separate identity of the regions and yet gives more powers to the
centre. Once the principle of identity of the State is accepted, it is
quite natural that the States would expect a greater role and powers
in the governance of the State and the country as a whole. This leads
to various demands from the States. From time to time, States have
demanded that they should be given more powers and more
autonomy. This leads to tensions and conflicts in the relations between
the centre and the States. While the legal disputes between the centre
and the States (or between States) can be resolved by the  judiciary,
demands for autonomy are of political nature and need to be resolved
through negotiations.

in India has to a large extent been influenced by the
changing nature of the political process. In the 1950s and
early 1960s the foundation of our federalism was laid
under Jawaharlal Nehru. It was also a period of Congress
dominance over the centre as well as the States. Except
on the issue of formation of new States, the relations
between the centre and the States remained quite normal
during this period. The States were hopeful that they would
be making progress with the help of the grants-in-aid from
the centre. Besides, there was considerable optimism
about the policies of socio-economic development designed
by the centre.

In the middle of the 1960s Congress dominance
declined somewhat and in a large number of States
opposition parties came to power. It resulted in demands
for greater powers and greater autonomy to the States. In
fact, these demands were a direct fallout of the fact that
different parties were ruling at the centre and in many
States. So, the State governments were protesting against
what they saw as unnecessary interference in their
governments by the Congress government at the centre.
The Congress too, was not very comfortable with the idea
of dealing with governments led by opposition parties.
This peculiar political context gave birth to a discussion
about the concept of autonomy under a federal system.

Finally, since the 1990s, Congress dominance has
largely ended and we have entered an era of coalition
politics especially at the centre. In the States too, different
parties, both national and regional, have come to power.

Role of Governors and President’s Rule
READ A CARTOON The role of Governors has always been a

controversial issue between the States and
the central government. The Governor is not
an elected office-holder. Many Governors
have been retired military officers or civil
servants or politicians. Besides, the Governor
is appointed by the central government and
therefore, actions of the Governor are often
viewed as interference by the Central
government in the functioning of the State
government. When two different parties are
in power at the centre and the State, the role
of the Governor becomes even more

Don’t spare me Shankar, p.89 Powers and role of the Governor become
controversial for one more reason. One of the

most controversial articles in the Constitution is Article 356, which
provides for President’s rule in any State. This provision is to be
applied, when ‘a situation has arisen in which the Government of the
State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this
Constitution.’ It results in the takeover of the State government by
the Union government. The President’s proclamation has to be ratified
by Parliament. President’s rule can be extended till three years. The
Governor has the power to recommend the dismissal of the State
government and suspension or dissolution of State assembly. This
has led to many conflicts. In some cases, State governments were
dismissed even when they had a majority in the legislature, as had
happened in Kerala in 1959 or without testing their majority, as

166 happened in several other States after 1967. Some cases went to the
Supreme Court and the Court has ruled that constitutional validity
of the decision to impose President’s rule can be examined by the
judiciary.

recommended the creation of linguistic States, at least for

the major linguistic groups. In 1956, reorganisation of

some States took place. This saw the beginning of the

creation of linguistic States and the process is still

continuing. Gujarat and Maharashtra were created in

Chapter 7: Federalism

Broadly, two types of disputes keep recurring. One is
the border dispute. States have certain claims over 169
territories belonging to neighbouring States. Though
language is the basis of defining boundaries of the States,
often border areas would have populations speaking more
than one language. So, it is not easy to resolve this dispute
merely on the basis of linguistic majority. One of the long-
standing border disputes is the dispute between
Maharashtra and Karnataka over the city of Belgaum.
Manipur and Nagaland too, have a long-standing border
dispute. The carving out of Haryana from the erstwhile
State of Punjab has led to dispute between the two States
not only over border areas, but over the capital city of
Chandigarh. This city today houses the capital of both
these States. In 1985, the then Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi reached an understanding with the leadership of
Punjab. According to this understanding, Chandigarh
was to be handed over to Punjab. But this has not
happened yet.

While border disputes are more about sentiment, the
disputes over the sharing of river waters are even more
serious, because they are related to problems of drinking
water and agriculture in the concerned States. You might
have heard about the ‘Kaveri’ water dispute. This is a
major issue between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Farmers
in both the States are dependent on Cauvery waters.
Though there is a river water tribunal to settle water
disputes, this dispute has reached the Supreme Court.
In another similar dispute Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and
Maharashtra are battling over sharing the waters of
Narmada river. Rivers are a major resource and therefore,
disputes over river waters test the patience and cooperative

SPECIAL PROVISIONS

The most extra-ordinary feature of the federal arrangement

created in India is that many States get a differential

treatment. We have already noted in the chapter on

Legislature that the size and population of each State being

different, an asymmetrical representation is provided in

the Rajya Sabha. While ensuring minimum representation

to each of the smaller States, this arrangement also

ensures that larger States would get more representation.

In the case of division of powers, too, the Constitution

provides a division of powers that is common to all the

States.  And yet, the Constitution has some special

provisions for some States given their peculiar social and

historical circumstances. Most of the special provisions

pertain to the north eastern States (Assam, Nagaland,

Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, etc.) largely due to their

sizeable indigenous tribal population with a distinct

history and culture. However, these provisions have not

Jammu and Kashmir

The other State which had a special status was Jammu

170 and Kashmir (J&K) (Art. 370). Jammu and Kashmir was

one of the large princely States, which had the option of

joining India or Pakistan or remaining independent.

Reprint 2025-26



Chapter 7: Federalism

However, immediately after independence in October, 1947 Pakistan

sent tribal infiltrators from its side to capture Kashmir. This forced 171
the Maharaja Hari Singh to ask for Indian help and acceded to the

Indian Union.

Many of the Muslim majority areas in the Western and Eastern

parts joined Pakistan but J&K was an exception. Under these

circumstances, it was given much greater autonomy by the

Constitution. According to Article 370, the concurrence of the State

was required for making any laws in matters mentioned in the Union

and Concurrent lists. This was different from the position of other

states. In the case of the other States, the division of powers as listed

through three lists automatically applies. In the case of Jammu and

Kashmir, the central government had only limited powers and other

powers listed in the Union list and Concurrent list could be used

only with the consent of the State government. This gave greater

autonomy to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.

Earlier, there was a constitutional provision that allowed the

President, with the concurrence of the State government, to specify

which parts of the Union list should apply to the State. The President

had issued two Constitutional orders in concurrence with the

government of J&K making large parts of the Constitution applicable

to the State. As a result, though J&K had a separate constitution

and a flag, the Parliament’s power to make laws on subjects in the

Union List was fully accepted.

The remaining difference between the other States and the State

of J&K were that no emergency due to internal disturbances could

be declared in J&K without the concurrence of the State. The Union

government could not impose a financial emergency in the State and

the Directive Principles did not apply in J&K. Amendments to the

Indian Constitution (under Art. 368) could apply in concurrence

with the government of J&K.

At present, the special status given under 370 no longer exists.

By the Jammu and Kashmir reorganisation Act 2019, the State has

been bifurcated into two Union Territories viz., (i) Jammu and

Kashmir and (ii) Ladakh. The new arrangement has come into effect

from 31 October, 2019.

Conclusion
Federalism is like a rainbow, where each colour is separate, yet
together they make a harmonious pattern. Federalism has to
continuously maintain a difficult balance between the centre
and the States. No legal or institutional formula can guarantee
the smooth functioning of a federal polity. Ultimately, the people
and the political process must develop a culture and a set of
values and virtues like mutual trust, toleration and a spirit of
cooperation. Federalism celebrates both unity as well as
diversity. National unity cannot be built by streamlining
differences. Such forced unity only generates greater social strife
and alienation and tends finally to destroy unity. A responsive
polity sensitive to diversities and to the demands for autonomy
can alone be the basis of a cooperative federation.

government that involves the day-to-day life and problems

knowledge and local interest are essential ingredients for
democratic decision making. They are also necessary for

advantage of local government is that it is so near the
people. It is convenient for the people to approach the
local government for solving their problems both quickly

GROWTH OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN INDIA

Let us now discuss how local government has grown in
India and what our Constitution says about it. It is
believed that self-governing village communities existed
in India from the earliest times in the form of ‘sabhas’
(village assemblies). In the course of time, these village
bodies took the shape of Panchayats (an assembly of five
persons) and these Panchayats resolved issues at the
village level. Their role and functions kept on changing at
different points of time.

In modern times, elected local government bodies were
created after 1882. Lord Rippon, who was the Viceroy of
India at that time, took the initiative in creating these
bodies. They were called the local boards. However, due
to slow progress in this regard, the Indian National

order to be successful.  Panchayats therefore were looked upon as
instruments of decentralisation and participatory democracy.  Our
national movement was concerned about the enormous
concentration of powers in the hands of the Governor General sitting
at Delhi. Therefore, for our leaders, independence meant an assurance
that there will be decentralisation of decision making, executive and
administrative powers.

of the whole of India…Independence must begin at the

When the Constitution was prepared, the subject of local
government was assigned to the States. It was also mentioned in the
Directive Principles as one of the policy directives to all governments
in the country. As you have read in Chapter 2, being a part of the
Directive Principles of State Policy, this provision of the Constitution
was non-justiciable and primarily advisory in its nature.

It is felt that the subject of local government including panchayats
did not receive adequate importance in the Constitution. Do you
know why this happened? A few reasons can be advanced here.
Firstly, the turmoil due to the Partition resulted in a strong unitary
inclination in the Constitution. Nehru himself looked upon extreme
localism as a threat to unity and integration of the nation. Secondly,
there was a powerful voice in the Constituent Assembly led by
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar which felt that the faction and caste-ridden nature
of rural society would defeat the noble purpose of local government
at the rural level.

in development planning. Many members of the Constituent
Assembly wanted Village Panchayats to be the basis of democracy

Local Governments in Independent India
Local governments got a fillip after the 73rd and 74th

Constitution Amendment Acts. But even before that, some
efforts in the direction of developing local government bodies
had already taken place. First in the line was the
Community Development Programme in 1952, which
sought to promote people’s participation in local
development in a range of activities. In this background, a
three-tier Panchayati Raj system of local government was
recommended for the rural areas. Some States (like Gujarat,
Maharashtra) adopted the system of elected local bodies
around 1960. But in many States those local bodies did
not have enough powers and functions to look after the
local development. They were very much dependent on the
State and central governments for financial assistance.
Many States did not think it necessary to establish elected
local bodies. In many instances, local bodies were dissolved Why are people afraid of

After 1987, a thorough review of the functioning of local
government institutions was initiated. In 1989 the P.K.Thungon
Committee recommended constitutional recognition for the local
government bodies. A constitutional amendment to provide for
periodic elections to local government institutions, and enlistment of
appropriate functions to them, along with funds, was recommended.

73RD AND 74TH AMENDMENTS

In 1989, the central government introduced two constitutional
amendments. These amendments aimed at strengthening local
governments and ensuring an element of uniformity in their structure
and functioning across the country.

The Constitution of Brazil has created States, Federal
Districts and Municipal Councils.  Each of these is
assigned independent powers and jurisdiction. Just as
the Republic cannot interfere in the affairs of the States
(except on grounds provided by the constitution), states
are prohibited from interfering in the affairs of the
municipal councils. This provision protects the powers of
the local government.

182 Later in 1992, the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments were
passed by the Parliament.  The 73rd Amendment is about rural local
governments (which are also known as Panchayati Raj Institutions

Chapter 8: Local Governments

or PRIs) and the 74th amendment made the provisions relating to
urban local government (Nagarpalikas).  The 73rd and 74th 183
Amendments came into force in 1993.

We have noticed earlier that local government is a ‘State
subject‘. States are free to make their own laws on this
subject. But once the Constitution was amended, the States
had to change their laws about local bodies in order to
bring these in conformity with the amended Constitution.
They were given one year’s time for making necessary
changes in their respective State laws in the light of these
amendments.

All States now have a uniform three tier Panchayati Raj

Panchayat covers a village or group of villages. The intermediary
level is the Mandal (also referred to as Block or Taluka). These bodies
are called Mandal or Taluka Panchayats. The intermediary level body
need not be constituted in smaller States. At the apex is the Zilla
Panchayat covering the entire rural area of the District.

The amendment also made a provision
for the mandatory creation of the Gram
Sabha. The Gram Sabha would comprise all
the adult members registered as voters in the
Panchayat area. Its role and functions are
decided by State legislation.

fresh elections must be held within six months of such
dissolution. This is an important provision that ensures
the existence of elected local bodies. Before the 73rd
amendment, in many States, there used to be indirect
elections to the district bodies and there was no provision
for immediate elections after dissolution.

Reservations
One third of the positions in all panchayat institutions
are reserved for women. Reservations for Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes are also provided for at all the three
levels, in proportion to their population. If the States find
it necessary, they can also provide for reservations for the
other backward classes (OBCs).

It is important to note that these reservations apply

means that a seat may be reserved simultaneously for a
woman candidate and one belonging to the Scheduled

to be a Dalit woman or an Adivasi woman.

Transfer of Subjects
Twenty-nine subjects, which were earlier in the State list
of subjects, are identified and listed in the Eleventh
Schedule of the Constitution. These subjects are to be
transferred to the Panchayati Raj institutions. These
subjects were mostly linked to development and welfare
functions at the local level.  The actual transfer of these

184 functions depends upon the State legislation. Each State
decides how many of these twenty-nine subjects would
be transferred to the local bodies.

The provisions of the 73rd amendment were not made
applicable to the areas inhabited by the Adivasi
populations in many States of India. In 1996, a separate
act was passed extending the provisions of the Panchayat
system to these areas. Many Adivasi communities have
their traditional customs of managing common resources
such as forests and small water reservoirs, etc. Therefore,
the new act protects the rights of these communities to
manage their resources in ways acceptable to them. For
this purpose, more powers are given to the Gram Sabhas
of these areas and elected village panchayats have to get
the consent of the Gram Sabha in many respects. The
idea behind this act is that local traditions of self
government should be protected while introducing
modern elected bodies. This is only consistent with the
spirit of diversity and decentralisation.

State Election Commissioners
The State government is required to appoint a State
Election Commissioner who would be responsible for
conducting elections to the Panchayati Raj institutions.
Earlier, this task was performed by the State
administration which was under the control of the State
government. Now, the office of the State Election

74th Amendment
As we mentioned earlier, the 74th amendment dealt with
urban local bodies or Nagarpalikas.

What is an urban area? It is very easy to identify a big
city like Mumbai or Kolkata, but it is not so easy to say
this about some very small urban areas that are
somewhere between a village and a town. The Census of
India defines an urban area as having: (i) a minimum
population of 5,000; (ii) at least 75 per cent of male
working population engaged in non-agricultural
occupations and (iii) a density of population of at least
400 persons per sq. km. As per the 2011 Census, about
31% of India’s population lives in urban areas.

incorporated in the 74th amendment also and thus apply
to Nagarpalikas. The Constitution also mandated the
transfer of a list of functions from the State government to
the urban local bodies. These functions have been listed
in the Twelfth Schedule of the Constitution.

IMPLEMENTATION OF 73RD AND 74TH AMENDMENTS

All States have now passed a legislation to implement the
provisions of the 73rd and 74th amendments. During the
ten years since these amendments came into force (1994-
2004) most States have had at least two rounds of elections
to the local bodies. States like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan
and a few others have in fact held three elections so far.

significantly altered the social profile of local bodies. These
bodies have thus become more representative of the social 191
reality they operate within.  Sometimes this leads to
tensions. The dominant social groups which controlled
the village earlier do not wish to give up their power. This
leads to intensification of struggle for power. But tension
and struggle is not always bad. Whenever there is an
attempt to make democracy more meaningful and give
power to those who did not enjoy it earlier, there is bound
to be some conflict and tension in society.

29 subjects to the local governments. All these subjects
are related to functions linked to local welfare and So, the law is good but it is

perform the functions assigned to them. Many States have
not transferred most of the subjects to the local bodies.
This means that the local bodies cannot really function in
an effective manner. Therefore, the entire exercise of
electing so many representatives becomes somewhat
symbolic. Some people criticise the formation of the local
bodies because this has not changed the way in which
decisions are taken at the central and the State level. People
at the local level do not enjoy much powers of choosing
welfare programmes or allocation of resources.

Bolivia is frequently cited as one of the most successful cases
of democratic decentralisation in Latin America.  In 1994, the
Popular Participation Law decentralised power to the local level,
allowing for the popular election of mayors, dividing the country
into municipalities, and crafting a system of automatic fiscal
transfers to the new municipalities.  Bolivia is divided into 314
municipal governments. These governments in Bolivia are
headed by  popularly-elected mayors (presidente municipal) and
a municipal council (cabildo). Local elections occur nationwide
every five years.

Indian Constitution at Work

Bolivian local governments have been entrusted with building
local health and education facilities, as well as maintenance of
this infrastructure. In Bolivia, 20% of nationwide tax collections
are distributed among municipalities on a per capita basis.
While these municipalities may levy taxes on motor vehicles,
urban property, and large agricultural properties, fiscal
transfers provide the bulk of the operating budget for these
units.

Local bodies have very little funds of their own. The dependence of
local bodies on the State and central governments for financial
support has greatly eroded their capacity to operate effectively. While
rural local bodies raise 0.24% of the total revenues collected, they
account for 4% of the total expenditure made by the government. So
they earn much less than they spend. That makes them dependent
on those who give them grants.

Conclusion
This experience suggests that local governments continue to
be agencies implementing the welfare and development schemes
of the central and State government. Giving more power to local
government means that we should be prepared for real
decentralisation of power. Ultimately, democracy means that
power should be shared by the people; people in the villages
and urban localities must have the power to decide what policies
and programmes they want to adopt. As you have studied earlier,
democracy means decentralisation of power and giving more
and more power to the people. The laws about local governments
are an important step in the direction of democratisation. But
the true test of democracy is not merely in the legal provisions
but in the practice of those provisions.

Then how does the same Constitution continue to

is that our Constitution accepts the necessity of
modifications according to changing needs of the society.
Secondly, in the actual working of the Constitution, there
has been enough flexibility of interpretations. Both
political practice and judicial rulings have shown maturity
and flexibility in implementing the Constitution. These
factors have made our Constitution a living document
rather than a closed and static rulebook.

In any society, those responsible for drafting the
constitution at a particular time would face one common
challenge: the provisions of the constitution would
naturally reflect efforts to tackle the problems that the
society is facing at the time of making of the constitution.
At the same time, the constitution must be a document
that provides the framework of the government for the
future as well. Therefore, the constitution has to be able
to respond to the challenges that may arise in the future.
In this sense, the constitution will always have something
that is contemporary and something that has a more
durable importance.

the future generations will respect this document. At the same time,
they recognised that in the future, this document may require 199
modifications. Even at the time of writing the Constitution, they were
aware that on many matters there were differences of opinion.
Whenever society would veer toward any particular opinion, a change
in the constitutional provisions would be required. Thus, the Indian
Constitution is a combination of both the approaches mentioned
above: that the constitution is a sacred document and that it is an
instrument that may require changes from time to time.  In other
words, our Constitution is not a static document, it is not the final
word about everything; it is not unalterable.

After reading the section above, a number of
students in the class were confused. They made the
following statements. What would you say about
each of these statements?
± The Constitution is like any other law. It simply

tells us what are the rules and regulations
governing the government.

± The  Constitution is the expression of the will of
the people, so there must be a provision to change
the Constitution after every ten or fifteen years.

± The  Constitution is a statement of the philosophy
of the country. It can never be changed.

± The  Constitution is a sacred document.
Therefore any talk of changing it is against
democracy.

We have already seen that the makers of our
Constitution wanted to strike a balance. The Constitution
must be amended if so required. But it must be protected
from unnecessary and frequent changes. In other words,
they wanted the Constitution to be ‘flexible’ and at the
same time ‘rigid’. Flexible means open to changes and
rigid means resistant to changes. A constitution that can
be very easily changed or modified is often called flexible.
In the case of constitutions, which are very difficult
to amend, they are described as rigid. The Indian
Constitution combines both these characteristics.

The makers of the Constitution were aware of the fact
that there may be some faults or mistakes in the
Constitution; they knew that the Constitution could not
be totally free of errors. Whenever such mistakes would
come to light, they wanted the Constitution to be easily
amended and to be able to get rid of these mistakes. Then
there were some provisions in the Constitution that were
of temporary nature and it was decided that these could
be altered later on once the new Parliament was elected.
But at the same time, the Constitution was framing a
federal polity and therefore, the rights and powers of the
States could not be changed without the consent of the

There are many articles in the Constitution, which
mention that these articles can be amended by a simple 201
law of the Parliament. No special procedure for amendment
is required in such cases and there is no difference at all
between an amendment and an ordinary law. These parts
of the Constitution are very flexible. Read carefully the
following text of some articles of the Constitution. In both
these articles, the wording ‘by law’ indicates that these
articles can be modified by the Parliament without
recourse to the procedure laid down in Article 368. Many
other articles of the Constitution can be modified by the
Parliament in this simple manner.

For amending the remaining parts of the Constitution,
provision has been made in Article 368 of the Constitution.
In this article, there are two methods of amending the
Constitution and they apply to two different sets of articles
of the Constitution. One method is that amendment can
be made by special majority of the two houses of the
Parliament. The other method is more difficult: it requires
special majority of the Parliament and consent of half of
the State legislatures. Note that all amendments to the

bill, like all other bills, goes to the President for his assent, but in this
case, the President has no powers to send it back for reconsideration.
These details show how rigid and complicated the amending process
could have been. Our Constitution avoids these complications. This
makes the amendment procedure relatively simple. But more
importantly, this process underlines an important principle: only
elected representatives of the people are empowered to consider and
take final decisions on the question of amendments. Thus, sovereignty
of elected representatives (parliamentary sovereignty) is the basis of
the amendment procedure.

Special Majority
In the chapters on Election, Executive and Judiciary, we have come
across provisions that require ‘special majority’. Let us repeat again
what special majority means. Ordinarily, all business of the legislature
requires that a motion or resolution or bill should get the support of
a simple majority of the members voting at that time. Suppose that
at the time of voting on a bill, 247 members were present in the
house and all of them participated in the voting on the bill. Then, the
bill would be passed if at least 124 members voted in favour of the
bill. Not so in the case of an amendment bill. Amendment to the
Constitution requires two different kinds of special majorities: in the
first place, those voting in favour of the amendment bill should
constitute at least half of the total strength of that House. Secondly,
the supporters of the amendment bill must also constitute two-thirds
of those who actually take part in voting. Both Houses of the
Parliament must pass the amendment bill separately in this same
manner (there is no provision for a joint session). For every amendment
bill, this special majority is required.

Can you see the significance of this requirement? In the Lok Sabha
there are 545 members. Therefore, any amendment must be
supported by a minimum of 273 members. Even if only 300 members
are present at the time of voting, the amendment bill must get the
support of 273 out of them. But imagine that 400 members of Lok

202 Sabha have voted on an amendment bill. How many members should
support the bill to get the bill passed?

In addition to this, both the Houses must pass the amendment
bill (with special majorities) separately. This means that unless there

Two principles dominate the various procedures of

± One is the principle of special majority. For

Russia, etc. have employed this principle: In the
case of  constitution of US, it is two-thirds

± The other principle that is popular among many

But it would need to take at least some opposition parties
into confidence, if it wanted to amend the Constitution.
So, the basic principle behind the amending procedure is

“If those who are dissatisfied with the
Constitution have only to obtain a 2/3 majority
and if they cannot obtain even (that)..., their
dissatisfaction with the Constitution cannot be
deemed to be shared by the general public.”

Note that Dr. Ambedkar is talking here not only
of parliamentary majority. He refers to ‘sharing
(of the views) by the general public’. This
indicates that behind the majority there is the
principle of public opinion that governs decision-
making.

that it should be based on broad support among the political parties
and parliamentarians.

Ratification by States

For some articles of the Constitution, special majority is not
sufficient. When an amendment aims to modify an article related to
distribution of powers between the States and the central
government, or articles related to representation, it is necessary
that the States must be consulted and that they give their consent.
We have studied the federal nature of the Constitution. Federalism
means that powers of the States must not be at the mercy of the
central government. The Constitution has ensured this by providing
that legislatures of half the States have to pass the amendment bill
before the amendment comes into effect. We can say that for some
parts of the Constitution, greater or wider consensus in the polity
is expected. This provision also respects the States and gives them
participation in the process of amendment. At the same time, care
is taken to keep this procedure somewhat flexible even in its more
rigid format: consent of only half the States is required and simple
majority of the State legislature is sufficient. Thus, the amendment
process is not impracticable even after taking into consideration
this more stringent condition.

We may summarise that the Constitution of India can be amended
through large-scale consensus and limited participation of the States.
The founding fathers took care that Constitution would not be open
to easy tampering. And yet, future generations were given the right
to amend and modify according to the needs and requirements of
the time.

WHY HAVE THERE BEEN SO MANY

AMENDMENTS?
On 26 January 2024, the Constitution of India completed
74 years of its existence. In these years, it has been
amended 106 times. Given the relatively difficult method
of amending the Constitution, the number of amendments
appears quite high. Let us try to find out how it is that so
many amendments took place and what it means.

Let us first look at the brief history of the amendments:
look carefully at the graphs below. The same information
is presented in two different ways. The first graph depicts
the number of constitution amendments made every ten
years; the bar indicates the number of amendments in
that period. The second graph depicts the time taken for

years between 1974 and 1976. And again, in just three years, from
2001 to 2003, ten amendments took place. In the political history of
our country, these two periods are remarkably different. The first
was a period of Congress domination. Congress party had a vast
majority in Parliament ( it had  352 seats in the Lok Sabha and a
majority in most State Assemblies). On the other hand,
the period between 2001 and 2003 was a period marked by
coalition politics. It was also a period when different parties
were in power in different States. The bitter rivalry between
the BJP and its opponents is another feature of this period. And
yet, this period saw as many as ten amendments in just three
years. So, the incidence of amendments is not dependent
merely on the nature of majority of the ruling party alone.

There is always a criticism about the number of
amendments. It is said that there have been far too many 207
amendments to the Constitution of India. On the face of
it, the fact that 106 amendments took place in 74 years
does seem to be somewhat odd. But the two graphs above
suggest that amendments are not only due to political
considerations. Barring the first decade after the
commencement of the Constitution, every decade has
witnessed a steady stream of amendments. This means
that irrespective of the nature of politics and the party in
power, amendments were required to be made from time
to time. Was this because of the inadequacies of the
original Constitution? Is the Constitution too flexible?

Contents of Amendments made so far
Amendments made so far may be classified in three
groups. In the first group there are amendments, which

of the original provisions. They are amendments only in
the legal sense, but in matter of fact, they made no
substantial difference to the provisions.

This is true of the amendment that increased the age
of retirement of High Court judges from 60 to 62 years
(15th amendment). Similarly, salaries of judges of High
Courts and the Supreme Court were increased by an
amendment (54th amendment).

We may also take the example of the provision
regarding reserved seats in the legislatures for scheduled
castes and scheduled tribes. The original provision said
that these reservations were for a period of ten years.
However, in order to ensure fair representation of these
sections, it was necessary to extend this period by ten
years. Thus, after every ten years an amendment is made Yes, I think we should be looking

to extend the period by another ten years. This has led to at the changes rather than the

Do you remember the discussion in chapter four about
the role of the President? In the original Constitution, it
was assumed that in our parliamentary government, the
President would normally abide by the advice of the
Council of Ministers. This was only reiterated by a later
amendment when Article 74 (1) was amended to clarify
that the advice of the Council of Ministers will be binding
on the President (President shall act in accordance with
the advice of the Council of Ministers). In reality, this
amendment did not make any difference because, that is
exactly what has been happening all through. The
amendment was only by way of explanation.

Differing Interpretations
A number of amendments are a product of different
interpretations of the Constitution given by the judiciary
and the government of the day. When these clashed, the
Parliament had to insert an amendment underlining one
particular interpretation as the authentic one. It is part of
the democratic politics that various institutions would
interpret the Constitution and particularly the scope of
their own powers in a different manner. Many times, the
Parliament did not agree with the judicial interpretation
and therefore, sought to amend the Constitution to
overcome the ruling of the judiciary. In the period between
1970 and 1975 this situation arose frequently.

You will know more about these issues in the next year 209
when you study the political history of independent India.

Amendments through Political Consensus
Thirdly, there is another large group of amendments that
have been made as a result of the consensus among the
political parties. We may say that this consensus made it
necessary that some changes had to be made in order to
reflect the prevailing political philosophy and aspirations
of the society. In fact, many of the amendments of the
post-1984 period are instances of this trend. Remember
our question above about the peculiarity that even when
there were coalition governments, this period saw so many
amendments?  The reason is because many of these
amendments were based on an evolving consensus on
certain issues. Starting with the anti-defection amendment
(52nd amendment), this period saw a series of amendments So, politicians do agree on

years, the 73rd and the 74th amendments, etc. In this same
period, there were some amendments clarifying and
expanding the scope of reservations in jobs and
admissions. After 1992-93, an overall consensus emerged
in the country about these measures and therefore,
amendments regarding these measures were passed
without much difficulty (77 th, 81st, and 82nd
amendments).

Controversial Amendments
Our discussion so far, should not create an impression
that there has never been any controversy over amending
the Constitution. In fact, amendments during the period
1970 to 1980 generated a lot of legal and political
controversy.  The parties that were in opposition during
the period 1971-1976, saw many of these amendments

as attempts by the ruling party to subvert the
Constitution. In particular, the 38th, 39th and 42nd

amendments have been the most controversial
amendments so far. These three amendments were made
in the background of internal emergency declared in the
country from June 1975. They sought to make basic
changes in many crucial parts of the Constitution.

The 42nd amendment was particularly seen as a wide-

Constitution. It was also an attempt to override the ruling

It was said at that time that this amendment was

changes to the Preamble, to the seventh schedule of the
Constitution and to 53 articles of the Constitution? Many
MPs belonging to the opposition parties were in jail when
this amendment was passed in Parliament. In this
backdrop, elections were held in 1977 and the ruling
party (Congress) was defeated. The new government
thought it necessary to reconsider these controversial
amendments and through the 43rd and 44th amendments,
cancelled most of the changes that were effected by the
38th, 39th and the 42nd amendments. The constitutional

BASIC STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION OF THE
211

CONSTITUTION

One thing that has had a long lasting effect on the
evolution of the Indian Constitution is the theory of the
basic structure of the Constitution. You know already that
the Judiciary advanced this theory in the famous case of
Kesavananda Bharati. This ruling has contributed to the
evolution of the Constitution in the following ways:
± It has set specific limits to Parliament’s power to amend

the Constitution. It says that no amendment can violate
the basic structure of the Constitution;

± It allows Parliament to amend any and all parts of the
Constitution (within this limitation); and

± It places the Judiciary as the final authority in deciding
if an amendment violates basic structure and what
constitutes the basic structure.
The Supreme Court gave the Kesavananda ruling in

1973. In the past four decades, this decision has governed
all interpretations of the Constitution and all institutions
in the country have accepted the theory of basic structure.

Ah! So it is the judiciary
In fact, the theory of basic structure is itself an example of

the Constitution. It has emerged from judicial
interpretation. Thus, the Judiciary and its interpretation
have practically amended the Constitution without a
formal amendment.

All living documents evolve in this manner through
debates, arguments, competition and practical politics.
Since 1973, the Court has, in many cases, elaborated
upon this theory of basic structure and given instances
of what constitutes the basic structure of the Constitution
of India. In a sense, the basic structure doctrine has
further consolidated the balance between rigidity and
flexibility: by saying that certain parts cannot be amended,
it has underlined the rigid nature while by allowing
amendments to all others it has underlined the flexible
nature of the amending process.

Review of the Constitution
In the late nineties, efforts were made to
review the entire Constitution. In the year
2000 a commission to review the working of
the Constitution was appointed by the
Government of India under the chairmanship
of a retired Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, Justice Venkatachaliah. Opposition
parties and many other organisations
boycotted the commission. While a lot of
political controversy surrounded this
commission, the commission stuck to the
theory of basic structure and did not suggest
any measures that would endanger the basic
structure of the Constitution. This shows the
significance of the basic structure doctrine
in our constitutional practice.

There are many other examples of how judicial
interpretation changed our understanding of the
Constitution. In many decisions the Supreme Court had
held that reservations in jobs and educational institutions
cannot exceed fifty per cent of the total seats. This has
now become an accepted principle. Similarly, in the case
involving reservations for other backward classes, the
Supreme Court introduced the idea of creamy layer and

CONSTITUTION AS A LIVING DOCUMENT

We have described our Constitution as a living document. What does
that mean?

Almost like a living being, this document keeps responding to
the situations and circumstances arising from time to time. Like a
living being, the Constitution responds to experience. In fact that is
the answer to the riddle we mentioned at the beginning about the
durability of the Constitution. Even after so many changes in the
society, the Constitution continues to work effectively because of this
ability to be dynamic, to be open to interpretations and the ability to
respond to the changing situation. This is a hallmark of a democratic
constitution. In a democracy, practices and ideas keep evolving over
time and the society engages in experiments according to these. A
constitution, which protects democracy and yet allows for evolution
of new practices becomes not only durable but also the object of
respect from the citizens. The important point is: has the Constitution
been able to protect itself and protect democracy?

In the past six decades, some very critical situations arose in the
politics and constitutional development of the country. We have made
a brief reference to some of these in this chapter already. In terms of
constitutional-legal issues, the most serious question that came up

Reprint 2025-26



Indian Constitution at Work

again and again from 1950 was about the supremacy of
the Parliament. In a parliamentary democracy, the
Parliament represents the people and therefore, it is
expected to have an upper hand over both Executive and
Judiciary. At the same time, there is the text of the
Constitution and it has given powers to other organs of
the government. Therefore, the supremacy of the
Parliament has to operate within this framework.
Democracy is not only about votes and people’s
representation. It is also about the principle of rule of law.
Democracy is also about developing institutions and

institutions must be responsible to the people and
maintain a balance with each other.

Contribution of the Judiciary
During the controversy between the Judiciary and the
Parliament, the Parliament thought that it had the power
and responsibility to make laws (and amendments) for
furthering the interests of the poor, backward and the
needy. The Judiciary insisted that all this has to take place
within the framework provided by the Constitution and
pro-people measures should not bypass legal procedures,
because, once you bypass laws even with good intentions,
that can give an excuse to the power holders to use their
power arbitrarily. And democracy is as much about
checks on arbitrary use of power as it is about the
well-being of the people.

The success of the working of the Indian Constitution
lies in resolving these tensions. The Judiciary, in its
famous Kesavananda ruling found a way out of the
existing complications by turning to the spirit of the
Constitution rather than its letter. If you read the
Constitution, you will not find any mention of the ‘basic

214 structure’ of the Constitution. Nowhere does the
Constitution say that such and such are part of the basic
structure. In this sense, the ‘basic structure’ theory is the

invention of the Judiciary. How did it invent such a non-
existent thing? And how is it that all other institutions 215
have accepted this during the past four decades?

Therein lies the distinction between letter and spirit.
The Court came to the conclusion that in reading a text
or document, we must respect the intent behind that
document. A mere text of the law is less important than
the social circumstances and aspirations that have
produced that law or document. The Court was looking
at the basic structure as something without which the
Constitution cannot be imagined at all. This is an instance
of trying to balance the letter and the spirit of the
Constitution.

were made to ask the Court to reconsider its ruling. When
these failed, the 42nd amendment was made and
parliamentary supremacy was asserted. But the Court
again repeated its earlier stand in the Minerva Mills case
(1980). Therefore, even four decades after the ruling in
the Kesavananda case, this ruling has dominated our
interpretation of the Constitution. Political parties, political
leaders, the government, and Parliament, accepted the idea
of inviolable basic structure. Even when there was talk
about ‘review’ of the Constitution, that exercise could not
cross the limits set by the theory of the basic structure.

When the Constitution was made, leaders and people
of our country shared a common vision of India. In

Even within the Constituent Assembly, there were some
members who felt that this Constitution was not suited
to the Indian situation:

“The ideals on which this draft constitution is framed have
no manifest relation to the fundamental spirit of India.
…this Constitution …would not prove suitable and would
break down soon after being brought into operation.”

economic equality, well-being of all people, unity based on national
integrity. This vision has not disappeared. People and leaders alike
hold to the vision and hope to realize it. Therefore, the Constitution,
based on this vision, has remained an object of respect and authority
even after half a century. The basic values governing our public
imagination remain intact.

Conclusion
There can still be debates about what constitutes basic structure.
There is nothing wrong in such debates.  We must remember
that politics in a democracy is necessarily full of debates and
differences. That is a sign of diversity, liveliness and openness.
Democracy welcomes debates. At the same time, our political
parties and leadership have shown maturity in setting limits to
these debates. Because, politics is also about compromises and
give-and-take. Extreme positions may be theoretically very correct
and ideologically very attractive, but politics demands that
everyone is prepared to moderate their extreme views, sharp
positions and reach a common minimum ground. Only then
democratic politics becomes possible. Politicians and the people
of India have understood and practised these skills. That has
made the experience of working of the democratic Constitution

216 quite successful. Among the different organs of the government,
there will always be competition over which one is more important

In this book, so far we have studied some important provisions of our Constitution
and the way in which these have worked in the last 69 years. We also studied

constitution we have given ourselves. What objectives did we hope to achieve
by it? Do these objectives have a moral content? If so, what precisely is it? What
are the strengths and limitations of this vision and, by implication, the achievements
and weaknesses of the Constitution? In doing so, we try to understand what can
be called the philosophy of the Constitution.
After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand:

Chapter 10: The Philosophy of the Constitution

WHAT IS MEANT BY PHILOSOPHY OF THE
221

CONSTITUTION?
Some people believe that a constitution merely
consists of laws and that laws are one thing, values
and morality, quite another. Therefore, we can have
only a legalistic, not a political philosophy approach
to the Constitution.  It is true that all laws do not
have a moral content, but many laws are closely
connected to our deeply held values. For example, a
law might prohibit discrimination of persons on
grounds of language or religion. Such a law is
connected to the idea of equality. Such a law exists
because we value equality. Therefore, there is a
connection between laws and moral values.

We must therefore, look upon the constitution as a
document that is based on a certain moral vision. We need
to adopt a political philosophy approach to the
constitution. What do we mean by a political philosophy
approach to the constitution? We have three things in
mind.
± First, we need to understand the conceptual structure

of the constitution. What does this mean? It means
that we must ask questions like what are the possible
meanings of terms used in the constitution such as
‘rights’, ‘citizenship’, ‘minority’ or ‘democracy’?

± Furthermore, we must attempt to work out a coherent
vision of society and polity conditional upon an
interpretation of the key concepts of the constitution.
We must have a better grasp of the set of ideals
embedded in the constitution.

± Our final point is that the Indian Constitution must

arbitration.

Constitution as Means of Democratic Transformation
In the first chapter we have studied the meaning of the
term constitution and the need to have a constitution. It is
widely agreed that one reason for having constitutions is
the need to restrict the exercise of power.  Modern states
are excessively powerful. They are believed to have a
monopoly over force and coercion. What if institutions of
such states fall into wrong hands who abuse this power?
Even if these institutions were created for our safety and
well-being, they can easily turn against us. Experience of
state power the world over shows that most states are prone
to harming the interests of at least some individuals and
groups. If so, we need to draw the rules of the game in
such a way that this tendency of states is continuously
checked. Constitutions provide these basic rules and
therefore, prevent states from turning tyrannical.

Constitutions also provide peaceful, democratic means
to bring about social transformation. Moreover, for a
hitherto colonised people, constitutions announce and
embody the first real exercise of political self-determination.

Nehru understood both these points well. The demand
for a Constituent Assembly, he claimed, represented a
collective demand for full self-determination because; only

This approach had the potential of changing the theory of
constitutional democracy altogether: according to this approach,
constitutions exist not only to limit people in power but to empower
those who traditionally have been deprived of it. Constitutions can
give vulnerable people the power to achieve collective good.

Why do we need to go back to the Constituent Assembly?
Why look backwards and bind ourselves to the past? That may be
the job of a legal historian — to go into the past and search for the
basis of legal and political ideas. But why should students of politics
be interested in studying the intentions and concerns of those who
framed the Constitution? Why not take account of changed
circumstances and define anew the normative function of the
constitution?

In the context of America — where the constitution was written
in the late 18th century— it is absurd to apply the values and
standards of that era to the 21st century.  However, in India, the
world of the original framers and our present day world may not
have changed so drastically.  In terms of our values, ideals and
conception, we have not separated ourselves from the world of the
Constituent Assembly.  A history of our Constitution is still very
much a history of the present.

Indian Constitution at Work

In short, it is committed to freedom, equality, social justice, and some
form of national unity. But underneath all this, there is a clear
emphasis on peaceful and democratic measures for putting this
philosophy into practice.

Individual freedom
The first point to note about the Constitution is its commitment to
individual freedom. This commitment did not emerge miraculously
out of calm deliberations around a table. Rather, it was the product
of continuous intellectual and political activity of well over a century.
As early as the beginning of the nineteenth century, Rammohan Roy
protested against curtailment of the freedom of the press by the
British colonial state. Roy argued that a state responsive to the needs
of individuals must provide them the means by which their needs
are communicated. Therefore, the state must permit unlimited liberty
of publication. Likewise, Indians continued to demand a free press
throughout the British rule.

It is not surprising therefore that freedom of expression is an
integral part of the Indian Constitution.  So is the freedom from
arbitrary arrest. After all, the infamous Rowlatt Act, which the national
movement opposed so vehemently, sought to deny this basic freedom.
These and other individual freedoms such as freedom of conscience
are part of the liberal ideology. On this basis, we can say that the
Indian Constitution has a pretty strong liberal character. In the
chapter on fundamental rights we have already seen how the
Constitution values individual freedom. It might be recalled that for
over forty years before the adoption of the Constitution, every single
resolution, scheme, bill and report of the Indian National Congress
mentioned individual rights, not just in passing but as a non-
negotiable value.

Social Justice
When we say that the Indian Constitution is liberal, we do not mean
that it is liberal only in the classical western sense. In the book on

226 Political Theory, you will learn more about the idea of liberalism.
Classical liberalism always privileges rights of the individuals over
demands of social justice and community values.

State which of the following rights are part of

individual freedom:

± Freedom of expression

± Freedom of religion

± Cultural and educational rights of minorities

± Equal access to public places

The liberalism of the Indian Constitution differs from this version

in two ways. First, it was always linked to social justice. The best

example of this is the provision for reservations for Scheduled Castes

and Scheduled Tribes in the Constitution. The makers of the

Constitution believed that the mere granting of the right to equality

was not enough to overcome age-old injustices suffered by these

groups or to give real meaning to their right to vote. Special

constitutional measures were required to advance their interests.

Therefore the constitution makers provided a number of special

measures to protect the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled

Tribes such as the reservation of seats in legislatures. The Constitution

also made it possible for the government to reserve public sector

jobs for these groups.

Indian liberalism has two streams. The

first stream began with Rammohan Roy.

He emphasised individual rights,

particularly the rights of women. The

second stream included thinkers like K.C.

Sen, Justice Ranade and Swami

Vivekananda. They introduced the spirit

of social justice within orthodox Hinduism.

Indian Constitution at Work

Respect for diversity and minority rights
The Indian Constitution encourages equal respect between
communities. This was not easy in our country, first
because communities do not always have a relationship
of equality; they tend to have hierarchical relationships
with one another (as in the case of caste). Second, when
these communities do see each other as equals, they also
tend to become rivals (as in the case of religious
communities).  This was a huge challenge for the makers
of the Constitution: how to make communities liberal in
their approach and foster a sense of equal respect among
them under existing conditions of hierarchy or intense
rivalry?

It would have been very easy to resolve this problem
by not recognising communities at all, as most western
liberal constitutions do. But this would have been
unworkable and undesirable in our country. This is not
because Indians are attached to communities more than
others. Individuals everywhere also belong to cultural
communities and every such community has its own
values, traditions, customs and language shared by its
members. For example, individuals in France or Germany
belong to a linguistic community and are deeply attached
to it. What makes us different is that we have more openly

One such right is the right of religious communities
to establish and run their own educational institutions.
Such institutions may receive money from the

228 government. This provision shows that the Indian
Constitution does not see religion merely as a ‘private’
matter concerning the individual.

Chapter 10: The Philosophy of the Constitution

Secularism
Secular states are widely seen as treating religion as only 229
a private matter. That is to say, they refuse to give religion
public or official recognition. Does this mean that the
Indian Constitution is not secular? This does not follow.
Though the term ‘secular’ was not initially mentioned, the
Indian Constitution has always been secular. The
mainstream, western conception, of secularism means
mutual exclusion of state and religion in order to protect
values such as individual freedom and citizenship rights
of individuals.

Again, this is something that you will learn more about
in Political Theory. The term ‘mutual exclusion’ means this: Have they started teaching

affairs of one another. The state must not intervene in the
domain of religion; religion likewise should not dictate state
policy or influence the conduct of the state. In other words,
mutual exclusion means that religion and state must be
strictly separated.

What is the purpose behind strict separation? It is to
safeguard the freedom of individuals. States which lend
support to organised religions make them more powerful
than they already are. When religious organisations begin
to control the religious lives of individuals, when they start
dictating how they should relate to God or how they should
pray, individuals may have the option of turning to the
modern state for protecting their religious freedom, but what
help would a state offer them if it has already joined hands
with these organisations? To protect religious freedom of
individuals, therefore, state must not help religious
organisations. But at the same time, state should not tell
religious organisations how to manage their affairs. That
too can thwart religious freedom. The state must, therefore,
not hinder religious organisations either. In short, states
should neither help nor hinder religions. Instead, they should
keep themselves at an arm’s length from them. This has been
the prevalent western conception of secularism.

Reprint 2025-26



Indian Constitution at Work

Conditions in India were different and to respond to the
challenge they posed, the makers of the Constitution had
to work out an alternative conception of secularism. They
departed from the western model in two ways and for two
different reasons.
± Rights of Religious Groups

First, as mentioned already, they recognised that inter-
community equality was as necessary as equality
between individuals. This was because a person’s
freedom and sense of self-respect was directly
dependent upon the status of her community. If one
community was dominated by another, then its
members would also be significantly less free. If, on
the other hand, their relations were equal, marked by
an absence of domination, then its members would
also walk about with dignity, self-respect and freedom.
Thus, the Indian Constitution grants rights to all
religious communities such as the right to establish
and maintain their educational institutions. Freedom
of religion in India means the freedom of religion of
both individuals and communities. 

± State’s Power of Intervention
Second, separation in India could not mean mutual
exclusion. Why is it so? Because, religiously
sanctioned customs such as untouchability deprived
individuals of the most basic dignity and self-respect.
Such customs were so deeply rooted and pervasive

principled distance, a rather complex idea that allows the state
to be distant from all religions so that it can intervene or abstain 231
from interference, depending upon which of these two would better
promote liberty, equality and social justice.  
We have hitherto mentioned three core features — these can also
be seen as the achievements — of our Constitution.

± First, our Constitution reinforces and reinvents forms of liberal
individualism. This is an important achievement because this is
done in the backdrop of a society where community values are
often indifferent or hostile to individual autonomy.

± Second, our Constitution upholds the principle of social justice
without compromising on individual liberties. The constitutional
commitment to caste-based affirmative action programme shows
how much ahead India was compared to other nations.  Can one
forget that affirmative action programmes in the U.S. were begun
after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, almost two decades after they
were constitutionally entrenched in India?

± Third, against the background of inter-communal strife, the
Constitution upholds its commitment to group rights (the right
to the expression of cultural particularity). This indicates that
the framers of the Constitution were more than willing to face the
challenges of what more than four decades later has come to be
known as multiculturalism.

Universal franchise
Two other core features may also be regarded as achievements. First,
it is no mean achievement to commit oneself to universal franchise,
specially when there is widespread belief that traditional hierarchies
in India are congealed and more or less impossible to eliminate, and
when the right to vote has only recently been extended to women
and to the working class in stable, Western democracies.

Once the idea of a nation took root among the elite, the idea of
democratic self-government followed. Thus, Indian nationalism
always conceived of a political order based on the will of every single
member of society. The idea of universal franchise lay securely within
the heart of nationalism. As early as the Constitution of India Bill
(1895), the first non-official attempt at drafting a constitution for
India, the author declared that every citizen, i.e., anyone born in

Federalism

Second, by introducing the article concerning North-East

(Art. 371), the Indian Constitution anticipates the very

important concept of asymmetric federalism. We have seen

in the chapter on federalism that the Constitution has

created a strong central government. But despite this

unitary bias of the Indian Constitution, there are

important constitutionally embedded differences between

the legal status and prerogatives of different sub-units

within the same federation.  Unlike the constitutional
232 symmetry of American federalism, Indian federalism has

been constitutionally asymmetric. To meet the specific

Chapter 10: The Philosophy of the Constitution

needs and requirements of some sub-units, it was always

part of the original design to have a unique relationship 233
with them or to give them special status. 

Under Article 371A, the privilege of special status was

also accorded to the North-Eastern State of Nagaland. This

Article not only confers validity on pre-existing laws within

Nagaland, but also protects local identity through

restrictions on immigration. Many other States too, are

beneficiaries of such special provisions. According to the

Indian Constitution, then, there is nothing bad about this

differential treatment.

Although the Constitution did not originally envisage

this, India is now a multi-lingual federation. Each major

arena exists that allows for the play of multiple identities

that complement one another.

National identity

Thus, the Constitution constantly reinforces a common

national identity. In the chapter on federalism, you have

studied how India strives to retain regional identities along

with the national identity. It is clear from what is

mentioned above that this common national identity was

not incompatible with distinct religious or linguistic

identities. The Indian Constitution tried to balance these

various identities. Yet, preference was given to common

identity under certain conditions. This is clarified in the

debate over separate electorates based on religious identity

which the Constitution rejects. Separate electorates were

rejected not because they fostered difference between

religious communities as such or because they

endangered a simple notion of national unity but because

they endangered a healthy national life. Rather than forced unity,
our Constitution sought to evolve true fraternity, a goal dear to the
heart of Dr. Ambedkar. As Sardar Patel put it, the main objective
was to evolve ‘one community’.

“But in the long run, it
would be in the interest of
all to forget that there is
anything like majority or
minority in this country
and that in India there is
only one community…”

Sardar Patel, CAD, Vol. VIII, p. 272, 25 May 1949

 

PROCEDURAL ACHIEVEMENTS

All these five core features are what might be called the substantive
achievements of the Constitution.  However, there were also some
procedural achievements.
± First, the Indian Constitution reflects a faith in political

deliberation. We know that many groups and interests were not
adequately represented in the Constituent Assembly. But the
debates in the Assembly amply show that the makers of the
Constitution wanted to be as inclusive in their approach as
possible. This open-ended approach indicates the willingness of
people to modify their existing preferences, in short, to justify
outcomes by reference not to self-interest but to reasons.  It also
shows a willingness to recognise creative value in difference and

234 disagreement.
± Second, it reflects a spirit of compromise and accommodation.

These words, compromise and accommodation, should not
always be seen with disapproval. Not all compromises are bad.

Reprint 2025-26



Chapter 10: The Philosophy of the Constitution

If something of value is traded off for mere self-interest,
then we naturally have compromised in the bad sense. 235
However, if one value is partially traded off for another
value, especially in an open process of free deliberation
among equals, then the compromise arrived in this
manner can hardly be objected to.  We may lament
that we could not have everything but to secure a bit
of all things important cannot be morally blame-
worthy.  Besides, a commitment to the idea that
decisions on the most important issues must be arrived
at consensually rather than by majority vote is equally
morally commendable.

CRITICISMS design of institutions, but how can
The Indian Constitution can be subjected to many conflicting principles be
criticisms of which three may be briefly mentioned: first, accommodated?
that it is unwieldy; second, that it is unrepresentative and
third, that it is alien to our conditions.

The criticism that it is unwieldy is based on the
assumption that the entire constitution of a country must
be found in one compact document.  But this is not true
even of countries such as the US which do have a compact
constitution.  The fact is that a country’s constitution is
to be identified with a compact document and with other
written documents with constitutional status. Thus, it is
possible to find important constitutional statements and
practices outside one compact document. In the case of
India, many such details, practices and statements are
included in one single document and this has made that
document somewhat large in size. Many countries for
instance, do not have provisions for election commission
or the civil service commission in the document known as
constitution. But in India, many such matters are
attended to by the Constitutional document itself.

not yet granted and most members came from the
advanced sections of the society. Does this make our
Constitution unrepresentative?

Here we must distinguish two components of
representation, one that might be called voice and the other
opinion.  The voice component of representation is
important.  People must be recognised in their own
language or voice, not in the language of the masters.  If
we look at the Indian Constitution from this dimension, it
is indeed unrepresentative because members of the
Constituent Assembly were chosen by a restricted
franchise, not by universal suffrage.  However, if we
examine the other dimension, we may not find it altogether
lacking in representativeness. The claim that almost every
shade of opinion was represented in the Constituent
Assembly may be a trifle exaggerated but may have
something to it.  If we read the debates that took place in
the Constituent Assembly, we find that a vast range of
issues and opinions were mentioned, members raised
matters not only based on their individual social concerns
but based on the perceived interests and concerns of
various social sections as well.

entirely an alien document, borrowed article by article
from western constitutions and sits uneasily with the
cultural ethos of the Indian people. This criticism is often
voiced by many. Even in the Constituent Assembly itself,
there were some voices that echo this concern.

How far is this charge true?

236 It is true that the Indian Constitution is modern and
partly western. Do you remember that in the first chapter
we have listed the various sources from which our
Constitution ‘borrowed’? But in this chapter you have also

“…we wanted the music of Veena or Sitar, but here we 237
have the music of an English band. That was because
our constitution makers were educated that way.
…That is exactly the kind of Constitution Mahatma
Gandhi did not want and did not envisage.”

seen that it was never a blind borrowing. It was innovative borrowing.
Besides, as we shall see, this does not make it entirely alien.

First, many Indians have not only adopted modern ways of
thinking, but have made these their own. For them westernisation
became a form of protest against the filth in their own tradition.
Rammohan Roy started this trend and it is continued to this day by
Dalits. Indeed, as early as 1841, it was noticed that the Dalit people
of northern India were not afraid to use the newly introduced legal
system and bring suits against their landlords. So, this new
instrument of modern law was effectively adopted by the people to
address questions of dignity and justice.
  Second, when western modernity began to interact with local
cultural systems, something like a hybrid culture began to emerge,
possibly by creative adaptation, for which a parallel can be found
neither in western modernity nor in indigenous tradition. This cluster
of newly developed phenomenon forged out of western modern and
indigenous traditional cultural systems have the character of a
different, alternative modernity. In non-western societies, different
modernities emerged as non-western societies tried to break loose
not only from their own past practices but also from the shackles of
a particular version of western modernity imposed on them. Thus,
when we were drafting our Constitution, efforts were made to
amalgamate western and traditional Indian values. It was a process
of selective adaptation and not borrowing.

Limitations
All this is not to say that the Constitution of India is a perfect and
flawless document. Given the social conditions within which the

Constitution was made, it was only natural that there may
be many controversial matters, that there would be many
areas that needed careful revision. There are many
features of this Constitution that have emerged mainly
due to the exigencies of the time. Nonetheless, we must
admit that there are many limitations to this Constitution.
Let us briefly mention the limitations of the Constitution.
± First, the Indian Constitution has a centralised idea

of national unity.
± Second, it appears to have glossed over some

important issues of gender justice, particularly within
the family.

± Third, it is not clear why in a poor developing country,
certain basic socio-economic rights were relegated to
the section on Directive Principles rather than made
an integral feature of our fundamental rights.

 It is possible to give answers to these limitations, to explain
why this happened, or even to overcome them. But that is
not our point. We are arguing that these limitations are
not serious enough to jeopardise the philosophy of the
Constitution.

Conclusion
In the previous chapter we described the
Constitution as a living document. It is these core
features of the Constitution that give it this stature

studied throughout this book are based on a core
and commonly agreed vision. That vision has
historically emerged through our struggle for

238 independence. The Constituent Assembly was the
platform on which this vision was stated, refined
and articulated in legal-institutional form. Thus, the

Reprint 2025-26



Chapter 10: The Philosophy of the Constitution

Constitution becomes the embodiment of this vision. Many
people have said that the best summary of this vision or the 239
philosophy of the Constitution is to be found in the preamble to
our Constitution.

Have you carefully read the preamble? Apart from the various
objectives mentioned in it, the preamble makes a very humble
claim: the Constitution is not ‘given’ by a body of great men, it
is prepared and adopted by ‘We, the people of India…’. Thus,
the people are themselves the makers of their own destinies,
and democracy is the instrument that people have used for
shaping their present and their future. More than five decades
since the Constitution was drafted, we have fought over many
matters, we have seen that the courts and the governments
have disagreed on many interpretations, the centre and the
States have many differences of opinion, and political parties
have fought bitterly. As you will study next year, our politics
has been full of problems and shortcomings. And yet, if you
asked the politician or the common citizen, you will find that
every one continues to share in that famous vision embodied in
the Constitution: we want to live together and prosper together
on the basis of the principles of equality, liberty and fraternity.
This sharing in the vision or the philosophy of the Constitution
is the valuable outcome of the working of the Constitution. In
1950, making of this Constitution was a great achievement.
Today, keeping alive the philosophical vision of that Constitution
may be our important achievement.

arguments and state which of these do you agree with and why.

Jayesh: I still think that our Constitution is only a borrowed

Saba: Do you mean to say that there is nothing Indian in it? But is
there such a thing as Indian and western in the case of values and
ideas? Take equality between men and women. What is western
about it? And even if it is, should we reject it only because it is
western?

Jayesh: What I mean is that after fighting for independence from
the British, did we not adopt their system of parliamentary
government?

Neha: You forget that when we fought the British, we were not
against the British as such, we were against the principle of
colonialism. That has nothing to do with adopting a system of
