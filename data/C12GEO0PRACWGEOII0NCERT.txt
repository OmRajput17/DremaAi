Foreword

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s
life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks
a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our
system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi
and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement
this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the
maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these
measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred
system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).

The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and
teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to
pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space,
time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the
information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as
the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and
sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we
perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed
body of knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of
functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in
implementing the annual  calendar so that the required number of teaching
days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and
evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making
children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or
boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular
burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with
greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.
The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and
space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory
committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the higher secondary level, Professor
Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor M.H. Qureshi for
guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the
development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this
possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have

Reprint 2025-26



generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel.
We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee,
appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of
Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri
and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an
organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the
quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will
enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on
students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the
content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative
mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to
rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed
by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:

• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same
class

• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject

• Difficulty level

• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions
from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-
learning

• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the
changes given above.

Data – Its Source and Compilation 
You must have seen and used various forms of data. For example, at the end of
almost every news bulletin on Television, the temperatures recorded on that day
in major cities are displayed. Similarly, the books on the Geography of India
show data relating to the growth and distribution of population, and the
production, distribution and trade of various crops, minerals and industrial
products in tabular form. Have you ever thought what they mean? From where
these data are obtained? How are they tabulated and processed to extract
meaningful information from them ? In this chapter, we will deliberate on these
aspects of the data and try to answer these many questions.

What  is  Data?
The data are defined as numbers that represent measurements from the real
world. Datum is a single measurement. We often read the news like 20 centimetres
of continuous rain in Barmer or 35 centimetres of rain at a stretch in Banswara
in 24 hours or information such as New Delhi – Mumbai distance via Kota –
Vadodara is 1385 kilometres and via Itarsi - Manmad is 1542 kilometres by
train. This numerical information is called data. It may be easily realised that
there are large volume of data available around the world today. However, at
times, it becomes difficult to derive logical conclusions from these data if they are
in raw form. Hence, it is important to ensure that the measured information is
algorithmically derived and/or logically deduced and/or statistically calculated
from multiple data. Information is defined as either a meaningful answer to a
query or a meaningful stimulus that can cascade into further queries.

Need of  Data
Maps are important tools in studying geography. Besides, the distribution and
growth of phenomena are also explained through the data in tabular form. We
know that an interelationship exists between many phenomena over the surface
of the earth. These interactions are influenced by many variables which can be

Reprint 2025-26



explained best in quantitative terms. Statistical analysis of those variables has
become a necessity today. For example, to study cropping pattern of an area, it
is necessary to have statistical information about the cropped area, crop yield
and production, irrigated area, amount of rainfall and inputs like use of fertiliser,
insecticides, pesticides, etc. Similarly, data related to the total population, density,
number of migrants, occupation of people, their salaries, industries, means of
transportation and communication is needed to study the growth of a city. Thus,
data plays an important role in geographical analysis.

Presentat ion of  the Data
You might have heard the story of a person who was travelling with his wife and
a five-year old child. On his way, he had to cross a river. Firstly, he fathomed the
depth of the river at four points as 0.6, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.5 metres. He calculated the
average depth as 0.95 metres. His child’s height was 1 metre. So, he led them to
cross the river and his child drowned in the river. On the other bank, he sat
pondering: “Lekha Jokha Thahe, to Bachha Dooba Kahe?” (Why did the child
drown when average depth was within the reach of each one?). This is called
statistical fallacy, which may deviate you from the real situation. So, it is important
to collect the data to know the facts and figures, but equally important is the
presentation of data. Today, the use of statistical methods in the analysis,
presentation and in drawing conclusions plays a significant role in almost all
disciplines, including geography, which use the data. It may, therefore, be inferred
that the concentration of a phenomenon, e.g., population, forest or network of
transportation or communication not only vary over space and time but may
also be conveniently explained using the data. In other words, you may say that
there is a shift from qualitative description to quantitative analysis in explaining
the relationship among variables. Hence, analytical tools and techniques have

2 become more important these days to make the study more logical and derive
precise conclusion. Precise quantitative techniques are used right from the
beginning of collecting and compiling data to its tabulation, organisation, ordering
and analysis till the derivation of conclusions.

Sources  of  Data
The data are collected through the following ways.  These are : 1. Primary Sources,
and 2. Secondary Sources.

The data which are collected for the first time by an individual or the group
of individuals, institution/organisations are called Primary sources of the
data. On the other hand, data collected from any published or unpublished
sources are called Secondary sources. Fig. 1.1 shows the different methods
of data collection.

Sources  of  Primary Data
1. Personal Observations
It refers to the collection of information by an individual or group of individuals
through direct observations in the field. Through a field survey, information about
the relief features, drainage patterns, types of soil and natural vegetation, as well
as, population structure, sex ratio, literacy, means of transport and
communication, urban and rural settlements, etc., is collected. However, in

carrying out personal observations, the person(s) involved must have theoretical
knowledge of the subject and scientific attitude for unbiased evaluation.

2. Interview
3

In this method, the researcher gets direct information from the respondent
through dialogues and conversations. However, the interviewer must take the
following precautions while conducting an interview with people of the area:

(i) A precise list of items about which information is to be gathered from
the persons interviewed be prepared.

(ii) The person(s) involved in conducting the interview should be clear about
the objective of the survey.

(iii) The respondents should be taken into confidence before asking any sensitive
question and he/she be assured that the secrecy will be maintained.

(iv) A congenial atmosphere should be created so that the respondent may
explain the facts without any hesitation.

(v) The language of the questions should be simple and polite so that
the respondents feel motivated and readily agree to give the
information asked for.

(vi) Avoid asking any such question that may hurt the self-respect or the
religious feelings of the respondent.

(vii) At the end of the interview, ask the respondent what additional
information he/she may provide, other than what has already been
provided by him/her.

(viii) Pay your thanks and gratefulness for sparing his/her valuable time
for you.

3. Questionnaire/Schedule
In this method, simple questions and their possible answers are written on a
plain paper and the respondents have to tick-mark the possible answers from
the given choices. At times, a set of structured questions are written and sufficient
space is provided in the questionnaire where the respondent write their opinion.
The objectives of the survey should be clearly mentioned in the questionnaire.
This method is useful in carrying out the survey of a larger area. Even
questionnaire can be mailed to far-flung places. The limitation of the method is
that only the literate and educated people can be approached to provide the
required information. Similar to the questionnaire that contains the questions
pertaining to the matter of investigation is the schedule. The only difference
between the questionnaire and the schedule is that the respondent himself/
herself fills up the questionnaires, whereas, a properly trained enumerator himself
fills up schedules by asking question addressed to the respondents. The main
advantage of schedule over the questionnaire is that the information from both
literate and illiterate respondents can be collected.

4. Other Methods
The data about the properties of soil and water are collected directly in the field
by measuring their characteristics using
soil kit and water quality kit. Similarly,
field scientists collect data about the
health of the crops and vegetation using
transducers (Fig. 1.2).

Secondary Source of  Data
Secondary sources of data consist of
published and unpublished records

which include government publications,
documents and reports.

6. Electronic Media

The electronic media, specially the internet, has emerged as a major source of
secondary data in recent times.

Unpublished Sources

1. Government Documents

The unpublished reports, monographs and documents are yet another source
of secondary data. These documents are prepared and maintained as
unpublished record at different levels of governance. For example, the village
level revenue records maintained by the patwari of respective villages serve as an
important source of village-level information.

2. Quasi-government Records

The periodical reports and the development plans prepared and maintained by
different Municipal Corporations, District Councils and Civil Services departments
are included in Quasi-government records.

3. Private Documents

These include unpublished reports and records of companies, trade unions,
different political and apolitical organisations and residents’ welfare associations.

Tabulat ion and Classi f icat ion of  Data
The data collected from primary or secondary sources initially appear as a big
jumble of information with the least of comprehension. This is known as raw
data. To draw meaningful inferences and to make them usable the raw data
requires tabulation and classification.

One of the simplest devices to summarise and present the data is the
Statistical Table. It is a systematic arrangement of data in columns and rows.
The purpose of table is to simplify the presentation and to facilitate comparisons.
This table enables the reader to locate the desired information quickly. Thus, the
tables make it possible for the analyst to present a huge mass of data in an
orderly manner within a minimum of space.

Data Compilat ion and Presentat ion
Data are collected, tabulated and presented in a tabular form either in absolute
terms, percentages or indices.

Absolute Data

When data are presented in their original form as integers, they are called absolute
data or raw data. For example, the total population of a country or a state, the
total production of a crop or a manufacturing industry, etc. Table 1.1 shows the
absolute data of population of India and some of the selected states.

from a common parameter, such as literacy rate or growth rate of population,
percentage of agricultural products or industrial products, etc. Table 1.2 presents

with respect to time, geographic
location or other characteristics. It is to be noted that index numbers not only
measure changes over a period of time but also compare economic conditions of
different locations, industries, cities or countries. Index number is widely used
in economics and business to see changes in price and quantity. There are various
methods for the calculation of index number. However, the simple aggregate
method is most commonly used. It is obtained using the following formula:

∑q1
×100

∑q0

∑q1 = Total of the current year production

∑q0 = Total of the base year production

Generally, base year values are taken as 100 and index number is calculated
thereupon. For example, Table 1.3 shows the production of iron ore in India and 7

the changes in index number from 1970–71 to 2000–01 taking 1970–71 as the
base year. Table 1.3 : Production of Iron Ore in India

Processing of  Data
The processing of raw data requires their tabulation and classification in selected
classes. For example, the data given in Table 1.4 can be used to understand how
they are processed.

We can see that the given data are ungrouped. Hence, the first step is to
group data in order to reduce its volume and make it easy to understand.

Grouping of  Data
The grouping of the raw data requires determining of the number of classes in
which the raw data are to be grouped and what will be the class intervals. The
selection of the class interval and the number of classes, however, depends upon
the range of raw data. The raw data given in Table 1.4 ranges from 02 to 96.  We
can, therefore, conveniently choose to group the data into ten classes with an
interval of ten units in each group, e.g. 0–10, 10–20, 20–30, etc. (Table 1.5).

Process  of  Classi f icat ion
Once the number of groups and the class interval of each group are determined,
the raw data are classified as shown in Table 1.5. It is done by a method popularly
known as Four and Cross Method or tally marks.

First of all, one tally mark is assigned to each individual in the group in which
it is falling. For example, the first numerical in the raw data is 47. Since, it falls in
the group of 40–50, one tally mark is recorded in the column 3 of Table 1.5.

Frequency Distribution

In Table 1.5 we have classified the raw data of a quantitative variable and  have
grouped them class-wise. The number of individuals (places in the fourth column
of Table 1.5) is known as frequency and the column represents the frequency

It is expressed by ‘f’ and represent the

40-50 6 27
number of individuals falling in each
group 50-60 10 37

(Table 1.6). The sum of all the
frequencies, assigned to all classes, 60-70 8 45

represents the total number of individual 70-80 6 51

observations in the given series. In 80-90 5 56

statistics, it is expressed by the symbol N 90-100 4 60
that is equal to ∑ f . It is expressed as

∑ f  = N = 60 (Table 1.5 and 1.6). ∑ f  = N = 60

Cumulative Frequencies

It is expressed by ‘Cf’ and can be obtained by adding successive simple
frequencies in each group with the previous sum, as shown in the column 3 of
Table 1.6. For example, the first simple frequency in Table 1.6 is 4. Next frequency
of 5 is added to 4 which gives a total of 9 as the next cumulative frequency.
Likewise, add every next number until the last cumulative frequency of 60 is
obtained. Note that it is equal to N or ∑ f .

Advantage of cumulative frequency is that one can easily make out that there
are 27 individuals scoring less than 50 or that 45 out of 60 individuals lie below
the score of 70. 9

Each simple frequency is associated with its group or class. The exclusive or
inclusive methods are used for forming the groups or classes.

Exclusive Method
As shown in Table 1.6, two numbers are shown in its first column . Notice that
the upper limit of one group is the same as the lower limit of the next group. For
example, the upper limit of the one group (20 – 30) is 30, which is the lower limit
of the next group (30 – 40), making 30 to appear in both groups. But any
observation having the value of 30 is included in the group where it is at its lower
limit and it is excluded from the group where it is the upper limit as (in 20-30
groups). That is why the method is known as exclusive method, i.e. a group is
excluded of its upper limits. You may now make out where all the marginal
values of Table 1.4 will go.

The groups in Table 1.6, are interpreted in the following manner –

0 and under 10 10 and under 20
20 and under 30 30 and under 40
40 and under 50 50 and under 60
60 and under 70 70 and under 80
80 and under 90 90 and under100

Hence, in this type of grouping the class extends over ten units. For example,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 are included in the third group.

Inclusive Method Table 1.7 : Frequency Distribution

In this method, a value equal to the Group f Cf
upper limit of a group is included in
the same group. Therefore, it is known 0 – 9 4 4

as inclusive method. Classes are 10 – 19 5 9

mentioned in a different form in this 20 – 29 5 14
method, as shown in the first column 30 – 39 7 21
of Table 1.7. Normally, the upper limit 40 – 49 6 27
of a group differs by 1 with the lower 50 – 59 10 37
limits of the next group. It is important 60 – 69 8 45
to note that each group spreads over 70 – 79 6 51
ten units in this method also. For 80 – 89 5 56
example, the group of 50–59 includes

90 – 99 4 60
the ten values i.e. 50, 51, 52, 53, 54,
55, 56, 57, 58 and 59 (Table 1.7). In ∑ f  = N = 60
this method, both the upper and
lower limit are included to find the frequency distribution.

Frequency Polygon

A graph of frequency
distribution is known
as the frequency
polygon. It helps in
comparing two or more
than two frequency
distributions (Fig.1.5).
The two frequencies are

10 shown using a bar
diagram and a line
graph respectively.

Ogive

When the frequencies
are added they are
called cumulative
frequencies and are

Fig. 1.5 : Frequency Distribution Polygon
listed in a table called
cumulative frequency table. The curve obtained by plotting cumulative
frequencies is called an Ogive (pronounced as ojive). It is constructed either by
the less than method or the more than method.

In the less than method, we start with the upper limit of the classes and go
on adding the frequencies. When these frequencies are plotted, we get a rising
curve as shown in Table 1.8 and Fig. 1.6.

In the more than method, we start with the lower limits of the classes
and from the cumulative frequency, we substract frequency of each class.
When these frequencies are plotted, we get a declining curve as shown in
Table 1.9 and Fig 1.7.

Both the Figs. 1.5 and 1.6 may be combined to get a comparative picture of
less than and more than Ogive as shown in Table 1.10 and Fig. 1.7.

##10##
You have learnt in previous chapter that organising and presenting data makes
them comprehensible. It facilitates data processing. A number of statistical
techniques are used to analyse the data e.g.

1. Measures of Central Tendency
2. Measures of Dispersion
3. Measures of Relationship

While measures of central tendency provide the value that is an ideal
representative of a set of observations, the measures of dispersion take into
account the internal variations of the data, often around a measure of central
tendency. The measures of relationship, on the other hand, provide the degree of
association between any two or more related phenomena, like rainfall and
incidence of flood or fertiliser consumption and yield of crops. In this chapter,
you will learn the measures of central tendency.

Measures of  Central  Tendency
The measurable characteristics such as rainfall, elevation, density of population,
levels of educational attainment or age groups vary. If we want to understand
them, how would we do ? We may, perhaps, require a single value or number
that best represents all the observations. This single value usually lies near the
centre of a distribution rather than at either extreme. The statistical techniques
used to find out the centre of distributions are referred as measures of central
tendency. The number denoting the central tendency is the representative figure
for the entire data set because it is the point about which items have a tendency
to cluster.

Measures of central tendency are also known as statistical averages. There
are a number of the measures of central tendency, such as the mean, median
and the mode.

Mean

The mean is the value which is derived by summing all the values and dividing it
by the number of observations.

Reprint 2025-26



Median

The median is the value of the rank, which divides the arranged series into two
equal numbers. It is independent of the actual value. Arranging the data in
ascending or descending order and then finding the value of the middle ranking
number is the most significant in calculating the median. In case of the even
numbers the average of the two middle ranking values will be the median.

Mode

Mode is the maximum occurrence or frequency at a particular point or value.
You may notice that each one of these measures is a different method of determining
a single representative number suited to different types of the data sets.

Mean

Mean is the simple arithmetic average of the different values of a variable. For
ungrouped and grouped data, the methods for calculating mean are necessarily
different. Mean can be calculated by direct or indirect methods, for both grouped
and ungrouped data.

Computing Mean from Ungrouped Data

Direct Method

While calculating mean from ungrouped data using the direct method, the values
for each observation are added and the total number of occurrences are divided
by the sum of all observations. The mean is calculated using the following formula:

X = ∑ x

The mean for the data given in Table 2.1 is computed as under:

X = ∑ x

N

6,484
   =

7

   = 926.29

It could be noted from the computation of the mean that the raw rainfall data
have been added directly and the sum is divided by the number of observations
i. e., districts. Therefore, it is known as direct method.

Indirect Method

For a large number of observations, the indirect method is normally used to
compute the mean. It helps in reducing the values of the observations to smaller
numbers by subtracting a constant value from them. For example, as shown in
Table 2.1, the rainfall values lie between 800 and 1100 mm. We can reduce
these values by selecting ‘assumed mean’ and subtracting the chosen number
from each value. In the present case, we have taken 800 as assumed mean. Such
an operation is known as coding. The mean is then worked out from these reduced
numbers (Column 3 of Table 2.1).

The following formula is used in computing the mean using indirect
method:

X =  + ∑ d
A

N
Where,

A = Subtracted constant 1 5

       ∑ d = Sum of the coded scores

N = Number of individual observations in a series
Mean for the data as shown in Table 2.1 can be computed using the indirect

method in the following manner :

884
 X =  800 +  

7

884
= 800+

7

X =  926.29 mm
Note that the mean value comes the same when computed either of the two

methods.

Computing Mean from Grouped Data

The mean is also computed for the grouped data using either direct or indirect
method.

Direct Method

When scores are grouped into a frequency distribution, the individual values
lose their identity. These values are represented by the midpoints of the class

Reprint 2025-26

DDDDDaaaaatttttaaaaa     PPPPPrrrrroooooccccceeeeessssssssssiiiiinnnnnggggg



intervals in which they are located. While computing the mean from grouped
data using direct method, the midpoint of each class interval is multiplied with
its corresponding frequency ( f ); all values of fx  (the X are the midpoints) are
added to obtain∑ fx  that is finally divided by the number of observations i. e.,
N. Hence, mean is calculated using the following formula :

X  = ∑ fx
  

N
Where :

X = Mean
f = Frequencies
x = Midpoints of class intervals

N = Number of observations (it may also be defined as  ∑ f  )

Example 2.2 : Compute the average wage rate of factory workers using data
given in Table 2.2:

Indirect Method

The following formula can be used for the indirect method for grouped data. The
principles of this formula are similar to that of the indirect method given for
ungrouped data. It is expressed as under

fd
 x =   A ± ∑

 
N

Where,
A  = Midpoint of the assumed mean group

(The assumed mean group in Table 2.3 is 90 – 110 with 100 as
midpoint.)

f    = Frequency
d   = Deviation from the assumed mean group (A)

N  = Sum of cases or ∑ f

i    = Interval width (in this case, it is 20)
From Table 2.3 the following steps involved in computing mean using the

direct method can be deduced :
(i) Mean has been assumed in the group of 90 – 110. It is preferably 1 7

assumed from the class as near to the middle of the series as possible.
This procedure minimises the magnitude of computation. In Table 2.3,
A (assumed mean) is 100, the midpoint of the class 90 – 110.

(ii) The fifth column (u) lists the deviations of midpoint of each class from
the midpoint of the assumed mean group (90 – 110).

(iii) The sixth column shows the multiplied values of each f by its
corresponding d to give fd. Then, positive and negative values of fd are
added separately and their absolute difference is found ( ∑ f d ). Note
that the sign attached to ∑ f d  is replaced in the formula following A,
where ± is given.

The mean using indirect method is computed as under :

Median
Median is a positional average. It may be defined “as the point in a distribution
with an equal number of cases on each side of it”. The Median is expressed
using symbol M.

Computing Median for Ungrouped Data

When the scores are ungrouped, these are arranged in ascending or descending
order. Median can be found by locating the central observation or value in the
arranged series. The central value may be located from either end of the series
arranged in ascending or descending order. The following equation is used to
compute the median :

Example 2.3:  Calculate median height of mountain peaks in parts of the
Himalayas using the  following:

8,126 m, 8,611m, 7,817 m, 8,172 m, 8,076 m, 8,848 m, 8,598 m.

Computation : Median (M) may be calculated in the following steps :
(i) Arrange the given data in ascending or descending order.
(ii) Apply the formula for locating the central value in the series. Thus :

4th item
Hence,

M = 8,172 m

Computing Median for Grouped Data

When the scores are grouped, we have to find the value of the point where an
individual or observation is centrally located in the group. It can be computed
using the following formula :

M =  l+   − c

Where,
M = Median for grouped data
l = Lower limit of the median class
i = Interval
f = Frequency of the median class

           N = Total number of frequencies or number of observations

The value that occurs most frequently in a distribution is referred to as mode. It
is symbolised as Z or M . Mode is a measure that is less widely used compared

0

to mean and median. There can be more than one type mode in a given data set.

Computing Mode for Ungrouped Data

While computing mode from the given data sets all measures are first arranged
in ascending or descending order. It helps in identifying the most frequently
occurring measure easily.

Example 2.5 :  Calculate mode for the following test scores in geography for ten
students :

 61, 10, 88, 37, 61, 72, 55, 61, 46, 22
Computation :  To find the mode the measures are arranged in ascending order
as given below:

20 10, 22, 37, 46, 55, 61, 61, 61, 72, 88.

The measure 61 occurring three times in the series is the mode in the given
dataset.  As no other number is in the similar way in the dataset, it possesses the
property of being unimodal.

Example 2.6 :  Calculate the mode using a different sample of ten other students,
who scored:

82, 11, 57, 82, 08, 11, 82, 95, 41, 11.
Computation  :    Arrange the given measures in an ascending order as shown
below :

08, 11, 11, 11, 41, 57, 82, 82, 82, 95
It can easily be observed that measures of 11 and 82 both are occurring

three times in the distribution. The dataset, therefore, is bimodal in appearance.
If three values have equal and highest frequency, the series is trimodal. Similarly,
a recurrence of many measures in a series makes it multimodal. However, when
there is no measure being repeated in a series it is designated as without mode.

Comparison of  Mean,  Median and Mode
The three measures of the central tendency could easily be compared with the
help of normal distribution curve. The normal curve refers to a frequency
distribution in which the graph of scores often called a bell-shaped curve. Many

human traits such as intelligence, personality scores and student achievements
have normal distributions. The bell-shaped curve looks the way it does, as it is
symmetrical. In other words, most of the observations lie on and around the
middle value. As one approaches the extreme values, the number of observations
reduces in a symmetrical manner. A normal curve can have high or low data
variability. An example of a normal distribution curve is given in Fig. 2.3.

Fig. 2.3 : Normal Distribution Curve

The normal distribution has an important characteristic. The mean, median
and mode are the same score (a score of 100 in Fig. 2.3) because a normal
distribution is symmetrical. The score with the highest frequency occurs in the
middle of the distribution and exactly half of the scores occur above the middle
and half of the scores occur below. Most of the scores occur around the middle of
the distribution or the mean. Very high and very low scores do not occur frequently
and are, therefore, considered rare. 2 1

If the data are skewed or distorted in some way, the mean, median and mode
will not coincide and the effect of the skewed data needs to be considered (Fig.
2.4 and 2.5).

You must have seen graphs, diagrams and maps showing different types of data.
For example, the thematic maps shown in Chapter 1 of book for Class XI entitled
Practical Work in Geography, Part-I (NCERT, 2006) depict relief and slope, climatic
conditions, distribution of rocks and minerals, soils, population, industries,
general land use and cropping pattern in the Nagpur district, Maharashtra. These
maps have been drawn using large volume of related data collected, compiled
and processed. Have you ever thought what would have happened if the same
information would have been either in tabular form or in a descriptive transcript?
Perhaps, it would not have been possible from such a medium of communication
to draw visual impressions which we get through these maps. Besides, it would
also have been a time consuming task to draw inferences about whatever is
being presented in non–graphical form. Hence, the graphs, diagrams and maps
enhance our capabilities to make meaningful comparisons between the
phenomena represented, save our time and present a simplified view of the
characteristics represented.  In the present chapter, we will discuss methods of
constructing different types of graphs, diagrams and maps.

Representat ion of  Data
The data describe the properties of the phenomena they represent. They are
collected from a variety of sources (Chapter 1). The geographers, economists,
resource scientists and the decision makers use a lot of data these days.  Besides
the tabular form, the data may also be presented in some graphic or diagrammatic
form. The transformation of data through visual methods like graphs, diagrams,
maps and charts is called representation of data. Such a form of the presentation
of data makes it easy to understand the patterns of population growth,
distribution and the density, sex ratio, age–sex composition, occupational
structure, etc. within a geographical territory. There is a Chinese proverb that ‘a
picture is equivalent to thousands of words’. Hence, the graphic method of the
representation of data enhances our understanding, and makes the comparisons
easy. Besides, such methods create an imprint on mind for a longer time.

General  Rules  for  Draw i n g  Graphs ,  Diagrams and Ma p s
1. Selection of a Suitable Method

Data represent various themes such as temperature, rainfall, growth and
distribution of the population, production, distribution and trade of different
commodities, etc. These characteristics of the data need to be suitably represented
by an appropriate graphical method. For example, data related to the temperature
or growth of population between different periods in time and for different
countries/states may best be represented using line graphs. Similarly, bar
diagrams are suited best for showing rainfall or the production of commodities.
The population distribution, both human and livestock, or the distribution of
the crop producing areas may suitably be represented on dot maps and the
population density using choropleth maps.

2. Selection of Suitable Scale

The scale is used as measure of the data for representation over diagrams and
maps. Hence, the selection of suitable scale for the given data sets should be
carefully made and must take into consideration entire data that is to be
represented. The scale should neither be too large nor too small.

3. Design

We know that the design is an important cartographic task (Refer ‘Essentials of
Map Making’ as discussed in Chapter 1 of the Practical Work in Geography,
Part-I (NCERT, 2006), a textbook of Class XI). The following components of the
cartographic designs are important. Hence, these should be carefully shown on
the final diagram/map.

24 Title

The title of the diagram/map indicates the name of the area, reference year of the
data used and the caption of the diagram. These components are represented
using letters and numbers of different font sizes and thickness. Besides, their
placing also matters. Normally, title, subtitle and the corresponding year are
shown in the centre at the top of the map/diagram.

Legend

A legend or index is an important component of any diagram/map. It explains
the colours, shades, symbols and signs used in the map and diagram. It should
also be carefully drawn and must correspond to the contents of the map/diagram.
Besides, it also needs to be properly positioned. Normally, a legend is shown
either at the lower left or lower right side of the map sheet.

Direction

The maps, being a representation of the part of the earth’s surface, need be oriented
to the directions. Hence, the direction symbol, i. e. North, should also be drawn
and properly placed on the final map.

Construct ion of  Diagrams
The data possess measurable characteristics such as length, width and volume.
The diagrams and the maps that are drawn to represent these data related
characteristics may be grouped into the following types:

(i) One-dimensional diagrams, such as line graph, poly graph, bar diagram,
histogram, age, sex, pyramid, etc.;

(ii) Two-dimensional diagram, such as pie diagram and rectangular diagram;

(iii) Three-dimensional diagrams, such as cube and spherical diagrams.
It would not be possible to discuss the methods of construction of these many
types of diagrams and maps primarily due to the time constraint. We will,
therefore, describe the most commonly drawn diagrams and maps and the way
they are constructed. These are :

• Line graphs • Bar diagrams

• Pie diagram • Wind rose and star diagram

• Flow Charts

Line Graph

The line graphs are usually drawn to represent the time series data related to the
temperature, rainfall, population growth, birth rates and the death rates. Table
3.1 provides the data used for the construction of Fig 3.2.

Construction of a Line Graph

(a) Simplify the data by converting it into round numbers, such as the
growth rate of population as shown in Table 3.1 for the years 1961 and
1981 may be rounded to 2.0 and 2.2, respectively.

(b) Draw X and Y-axis. Mark the time series variables (years/months) on
the X axis and the data quantity/value to be plotted (growth of population
in per cent or the temperature in 0C) on Y axis.

(c)  Choose an appropriate scale and label it on Y-axis. If the data involve a
negative figure, then the selected scale should also show it as shown in

(d) Plot the data to depict year/month-wise values according to the selected
scale on Y-axis, mark the location of the plotted values by a dot and
join these dots by a free hand drawn line.

Polygraph

Polygraph is a line graph in which two or more than two variables are shown by
an equal number of lines for an immediate comparison, such as the growth rate
of different crops like rice, wheat, pulses or the birth rates, death rates and life
expectancy or sex ratio in different states or countries. A different line pattern
such as straight line ( ____ ), broken line (- - - ), dotted line (……) or a combination
of dotted and broken line (-.-.-) or line of different colours may be used to indicate
the value of different variables (Fig 3.3).

Bar Diagram

The bar diagrams are drawn through columns of equal width. It is also called a
columnar diagram. Following rules should be observed while constructing a bar
diagram:

(a) The width of all the bars or columns should be similar.

(b) All the bars should be placed on equal intervals/distance.

(c) Bars may be shaded with colours or patterns to make them distinct
and attractive.

The simple, compound or polybar diagram may be constructed to suit the
data characteristics.

Simple Bar Diagram

A simple bar diagram is constructed for an immediate comparison. It is advisable
to arrange the given data set in an ascending or descending order and plot the
data variables accordingly. However, time series data are represented according
to the sequencing of the time period.

Pie Diagram

Pie diagram is another
graphical method of the
representation of data. It is
drawn to depict the total value
of the given attribute using a
circle. Dividing the circle into
corresponding degrees of
angle then represent the
sub-sets of the data. Hence, it
is also called Divided Circle
Diagram.

The angle of each variable
is calculated using the
following formulae.

Fig. 3.7 : Gross Electricity Generation in India

Value of given State/Region X 360
Total Value of All States/Regions

If data are given in percentage form, the angles are calculated using the given
formulae.

For example, a pie diagram may be drawn to show the total population of
India along with the proportion of the rural and urban population. In this case, 3 1

the circle of an appropriate radius is drawn to represent the total population and
its sub-divisions into rural and urban population are shown by corresponding
degrees of angle.

cm may be chosen for the given data set.

(b) Draw a line from the centre of the circle to the arc as a radius.

(c) Measure the angles from the arc of the circle for each category of vehicles
in an ascending order clock-wise, starting with smaller angle.

(d) Complete the diagram by adding the title, sub-title, and the legend. The
legend mark be chosen for each variable/category and highlighted by
distinct shades/colours.

Precautions
32 (a) The circle should neither be too big to fit in the space nor too small to be

illegible.

(b) Starting with bigger angle will lead to accumulation of error leading to
the plot of the smaller angle difficult.

Flow Maps/Chart

Flow chart is a combination of graph and map. It is drawn to show the flow of
commodities or people between the places of origin and destination.  It is also
called Dynamic Map. Transport map, which shows the number of passengers,
vehicles, etc., is the best example of a flow chart. These charts are drawn using
lines of proportional width. Many government agencies prepare flow maps to
show density of the means of transportation on different routes. The flow maps/
charts are generally drawn to represent two the types of data as given below:

1. The number and frequency of the vehicles as per the direction of their
movement

2. The number of the passengers and/or the quantity of goods transported.

Requirements for the Preparation of a Flow Map

of the regional distributions or the characteristics of variations over space. These
maps are also known as the distribution maps.

Requirements for Making a Thematic Map

(a) State/District level data about the selected theme.

Classi f icat ion of  Thematic  Maps based on Method of  Construct ion
The thematic maps are, generally, classified into quantitative and non-quantitative
maps. The quantitative maps are drawn to show the variations within the data.
For example, maps depicting areas receiving more than 200 cm, 100 to 200 cm,
50 to 100 cm and less than 50 cm of rainfall are referred as quantitative maps.

36 These maps are also called statistical maps. The non-quantitative maps, on the
other hand, depict the non-measurable characteristics in the distribution ofgiven
information, such as a map showing high and low rainfall-receiving areas. These
maps are also called qualitative maps. It would not be possible to discuss drawing
these different types of thematic maps under the constraint of time. We will,
therefore, confine to discuss the methods of the construction of the following
types of quantitative maps :

(a) Dot maps

(b) Choropleth maps

(c) Isopleth maps

Dot Maps

The dot maps are drawn to show the distribution of phenomena such as
population, cattle, types of crops, etc. The dots of same size as per the chosen
scale are marked over the given administrative units to highlight the patterns of
distributions.

Requirement

(a) An administrative map of the given area showing state/district/block
boundaries.

(b) Statistical data on selected theme for the chosen administrative units,
i.e., total population, cattle, etc.

(c) Selection of a scale to determine the value of a dot.
(d) Physiographic map of the region, especially relief and drainage maps.

Precaution

(a) The lines, demarcating the boundaries of various administrative units,
should not be very thick and bold.

(b) All dots should be of same size.

Construction

(a) Select the size and value of a dot.

(b) Determine the number of dots in each state using the given scale. For
example, number of dots in Maharashtra will be 9,67,52,247/100,000
= 967.52. It may be rounded to 968, as the fraction is more than 0.5.

(c) Place the dots in each state as per the determined number in all states.

(d) Consult the physiographic/relief map of India to identify mountainous,
desert, and/or snow covered areas and mark lesser number of dots in
such areas.

Choropleth Map

The choropleth maps are also drawn to depict the data characteristics as they
are related to the administrative units. These maps are used to represent the
density of population, literacy/growth rates, sex ratio, etc.

Requirement for drawing Choropleth Map

(a) A map of the area depicting different administrative units.

(b) Appropriate statistical data according to administrative units.

Steps to be followed

(a) Arrange the data in ascending or descending order.

(b) Group the data into 5 categories to represent very high, high, medium,
low and very low concentrations.

(c) The interval between the categories may be identified on the following
formulae i.e., Range/5 and Range = maximum value – minimum value. 3 9

(d) Patterns, shades or colour to be used to depict the chosen categories
should be marked in an increasing or decreasing order.

Example 3.13: Construct a Choropleth map to represent the literacy rates in
India in 2001 as given in Table 3.10.

Construction

(a) Arrange the data in ascending order as shown above.

(b) Identify the range within the data. In the present case, the states
recording the lowest and highest literacy rates are Bihar (47%) and
Kerala (90.9%), respectively. Hence, the range would be 91.0 – 47.0 =
44.0

(c) Divide the range by 5 to get categories from very low to very high. (44.0/
5 = 8.80.  We can convert this value to a round number, i. e., t 9.0

(d) Determine the number of the categories alongwith the range of each
category. Add 9.0 to the lowest value of 47.0 as so on. We will finally get
following categories :
47 – 56 Very low (Bihar, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu

and Kashmir)
56 – 65 Low (Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya,

Odisha, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh)

Isopleth Map

We have seen that the data related to the administrative units are represented
using choropleth maps. However, the variations within the data, in many cases,
may also be observed on the basis of natural boundaries. For example, variations
in the degrees of slope, temperature, occurrence of rainfall, etc. possess
characteristics of the continuity in the data. These geographical facts may be
represented by drawing the lines of equal values on a map. All such maps are
termed as Isopleth Map. The word Isopleth is derived from Iso meaning equal
and pleth means lines. Thus, an imaginary line, which joins the places of equal
values, is referred as Isopleth. The more frequently drawn isopleths include
Isotherm (equal temperature), Isobar (equal pressure), Isohyets (equal rainfall),
Isonephs (equal cloudiness), Isohels (equal sunshine), contours (equal heights),
Isobaths (equal depths), Isohaline (equal salinity), etc.

Requirement

(a) Base line map depicting point location of different places.

(b) Appropriate data of temperature, pressure, rainfall, etc. over a definite
period of time.

(c) Drawing instrument specially French Curve, etc.

Rules to be observed

(a) An equal interval of values be selected.

(b) Interval of 5, 10, or 20 is supposed to be ideal.

(c) The value of Isopleth should be written along the line on either side or
in the middle by breaking the line.

42
Interpolation

Interpolation is used to insert the intermediate values between the observed values
of at two stations/locations, such as temperature recorded at Chennai and
Hyderabad or the spot heights of two points. Generally, drawing of isopleths
joining the places of same value is also termed as interpolation.

Method of Interpolation

For interpolation, follow the following steps:

(a) Firstly, determine the minimum and maximum values given on the map.

(b) Calculate the range of value i.e. Range = maximum value – minimum
value.

(c) Based on range, determine the interval in a whole number like 5, 10,
15, etc.

The exact point of drawing an Isopleth is determined by using the following
formulae.

Distance between two points in cm
Point of Isopleth = ×  Interval 

Difference between the two values of corresponding points

The interval is the difference between the actual value on the map and
interpolated value. For example, in an Isotherm map of two places show 28 oC
and 33 oC and you want to draw 30 oC isotherm, measure the distance between
the two points. Suppose, the distance is 1cm or 10 mm and the difference between
28 and 33 is 5, whereas, 30 is 2 points away from 28 and 3 points behind 33,
thus, exact point of 30 will be

Thus, isotherm of 30 oC will be plotted 4mm away from 28 oC or 6mm ahead
of 33 oC.

(d) Draw the isopleths of minimum value first; other isopleths may be drawn
accordingly.

You know that the computers enhance our capabilities in data processing and
in drawing graphs, diagrams and maps. The disciplines that deals with the
principles and methods of data processing and mapping using a combination of
computer hardware and the application software are referred as the Database
Management System (DBMS) and the Computer Assisted Cartography,
respectively. However, the role of such computer applications is restricted to merely
processing of the data and their graphical presentation. In other words, the data
so processed or the maps and diagrams so prepared could not be used to evolve

46 a decision support system. As a matter of fact, there are several questions that
we normally encounter in our day-to-day life and look for satisfactory solutions.
These questions may be: What is where ? Why is it there ? What will happen if it
is shifted to a new location? Who will be benefited by such a reallocation? Who
are expected to loose the benefits if reallocation takes place? In order to,
understand these and many other questions, we need to capture the necessary
data collected from different sources and integrate them using a computer that
is supported by geo-processing tools. Herein lays the concept of a Spatial
Information System. In the present chapter, we will discuss basic principles of
the Spatial Information Technology and its extension to the Spatial Information
System, which is more commonly known as Geographical Information System.

What is  Spatial  Information Technology?
The word spatial is derived from space. It refers to the features and the phenomena
distributed over a geographically definable space, thus, having physically
measurable dimensions. We know that most data that are used today have spatial
components (location), such as an address of a municipal facility, or the
boundaries of an agricultural holdings, etc. Hence, the Spatial Information
Technology relates to the use of the technological inputs in collecting, storing,
retrieving, displaying, manipulating, managing and analysing the spatial
information. It is an amalgamation of Remote Sensing, GPS, GIS, Digital
Cartography and Database Management Systems.

What is  GIS  (Geographical  Information System)?
The advance computing systems available since mid 1970’s enable the processing
of georeferenced information for the purpose of organising spatial and attribute
data and their integration; locating specific information in individual files and
executing the computations, performing analysis and evolving a decision support
system.  A system capable of all such functions is called Geographic Information
System (GIS). It is defined as A system for capturing, storing, checking,
integrating, manipulating, analysing and displaying data, which are spatially
referenced to the Earth. This is normally considered to involve a spatially
referenced computer database and appropriate applications software. It is
an amalgamation of Computer Assisted Cartography and Database Management
System and draws conceptual and methodological strength from both spatial and
allied sciences such as Computer Science, Statistics, Cartography, Remote Sensing,
Database Technology, Geography, Geology, Hydrology, Agriculture, Resource
Management, Environmental Science, and Public Administration.

Forms of Geographical Information

Two types of the data represent the geographical information. These are spatial and
non – spatial data (Box 4.1). The spatial data are characterised by their positional,
linear and areal forms of appearances (Fig. 4.1).

Geographic Database : A database contains attributes and their value or class.
The non-spatial data on the left display cycle parts, which can be located
anywhere. The data record on the right is spatial because one of the attributes,
the name of different states, which have a definite locations in a map. This data
can be used in GIS.

These data forms must be geometrically registered to a generally accepted
and properly defined coordinate system and coded so that they can be stored in
the internal database structure of GIS. On the other hand, the data those describe
the spatial data are called as Non–spatial or attribute data. The spatial data are
the most important pre-requisite in a spatial or geographical information system.
In a GIS core, it could be built in several ways.  These are :

• Acquire data in digital form from a data supplier

• Digitise existing analogue data

• Carry out one’s own surveys of geographic entities.

The choice of a source of geographical data for a GIS application is, however,
largely governed by :

• The application area in itself

• The available budget, and

• The type of data structure, i.e., vector/raster.

For many users, the most common source of spatial data is topographical or
thematic maps in hard copy (paper) or soft copy form (digital). All such maps are
characterised by :

• A definite scale which provides relationship between the map and the
surface it represents,

• Use of symbols and colours which define attributes of entities mapped,
and

• An agreed coordinate system, which defines the location of entities on
the Earth’s surface.

48

Ad vantages  of  GIS  ove r  Ma n u a l  Me t h o d s
The maps, irrespective of a graphic medium of communication of geographic
information and possessing geometric fidelity, are inherited with the following
limitations :

(i) Map information is processed and presented in a particular way.

(ii) A map shows a single or more than one predetermined themes.

(iii) The alteration of the information depicted on the maps require a new
map to be drawn.

Contrarily, a GIS possesses inherent advantages of separate data storage
and presentation. It also provides options for viewing and presenting the data in
several ways. The following advantages of a GIS are worth mentioning :

1. Users can interrogate displayed spatial features and retrieve associated
attribute information for analysis.

2. Maps can be drawn by querying or analysing attribute data.

3. Spatial operations (polygon overlay or buffering) can be applied on
integrated database to generate new sets of information.

4. Different items of attribute data can be associated with one another
through shared location code.

Comp onents  of  GIS
The important components of a Geographical Information System include the
following:

(a) Hardware (b) Software (c) Data

(d) People (e) Procedures
The different components of GIS are shown in Fig. 4.2.

Hardware
As discussed in Chapter 4 the GIS has three major components :

• Hardware comprising the processing, storage, display, and input and
output sub-systems.

• Software modules for data entry, editing, maintenance, analysis,
transformation, manipulation, data display and output.

• Database management system to take care of the data organisation.

Software
An application software with the following functional modules is important
prerequisite of a GIS :

• Software related to data entry, editing and maintenance
• Software related to analysis/transformation/manipulation
• Software related to data display and output.

Data
Spatial data and related tabular data are the backbone of GIS. The existing data
may be acquired from a supplier or a new data may be created/collected
in-house by the user. The digital map forms the basic data input for GIS. Tabular
data related to the map objects can also be attached to the digital data. A GIS will
integrate spatial data with other data resources and can even use a DBMS. 4 9

People

GIS users have a wide range from hardware and software engineers to resources
and environmental scientists, policy-makers, and the monitoring and
implementing agencies. These cross-section of people use GIS to evolve a decision
support system and solve real time problems.

Procedures

Procedures include how
the data will be retrieved,
input into the system,
stored, managed,
transformed, analysed
and finally presented in
a final output.

The spatial data are represented in raster and vector data formats :

Raster Data Format

Raster data represent a graphic feature as a pattern of grids of squares, whereas
vector data represent the object as a set of lines drawn between specific points.
Consider a line
drawn diagonally
on a piece of paper.
A raster file would
represent this image
by sub-dividing the
paper into a matrix
of small rectangles,
similar to a sheet of
graph paper called
cells. Each cell is
assigned a position
in the data file and
given a value based
on the attribute at
that position. Its Fig. 4.3 : Generic Structure for a Grid
row and column
coordinates may identify any individual pixel (Fig. 4.3). This data representation
allows the user to easily reconstruct or visualise the original image.

The relationship between cell size and the number of cells is expressed as the
50 resolution of the raster. The effect of grid size on data in raster format is explained

in Fig. 4.4.

The Raster file formats are most often used for the following activities :

• For digital representations of aerial photographs, satellite images,
scanned paper maps, etc.

• When costs need to be kept down.

• When the map does not require analysis of individual map features.

• When “backdrop” maps are required.

Vector Data Format

A vector representation of the same diagonal line would record the position of
the line by simply recording the coordinates of its starting and ending points.
Each point would be expressed as two or three numbers (depending on whether
the representation was 2D or 3D, often referred to as X,Y or X,Y,Z coordinates)
(Fig. 4.5). The first number, X, is the distance between the point and the left side
of the paper; Y, the distance between the point and the bottom of the paper; Z,
the point’s elevation above or below the paper. Joining the measured points forms
the vector.

Fig. 4.5 : The Vector Data Model is based around Coordinate Pairs

A vector data model uses points stored by their real (earth) coordinates. Here
lines and areas are built from sequences of points in order. Lines have a direction
to the ordering of the points.  Polygons can be built from points or lines. Vectors
can store information about topology. Manual digitising is the best way of vector
data input.

The Vector files are most often used for :

• Highly precise applications

• When file sizes are important

• When individual map features require analysis

• When descriptive information must be stored

The advantages and the disadvantages of the raster and vector data formats
are explained in Box 4.2.

Sequence of  GIS  Act iv i t ies
The following sequence of the activities are involved in GIS-related work :

1. Spatial data input
2. Entering of the attribute data
3. Data verification and editing
4. Spatial and attribute data linkages
5. Spatial analysis

Spatial Data Input

As already mentioned, the spatial database into a GIS can be created from a
variety sources.  These could be summarised into the following two categories :

(a) Acquiring Digital Data sets from a Data Supplies

The present day data supplies make the digital data readily available, which
range from small-scale maps to the large-scale plans.  For many local governments
and private organisations, such data form an essential source and keep such
groups of users free from overheads of digitising or collecting their own data.
Although, using such existing data sets is attractive and time saving, serious
attention must be paid to data compatibility when data from different sources/
supplies are combined in one project. The differences in terms of projection, scale,
base level and description in attributes may cause problems.

At a practical level, users must consider the following characteristics of the
data to ensure that they are compatible with the application:

• The scale of the data
• The geo-referencing system used
• The data collection techniques and sampling strategy used
• The quality of data collected 5 3
• The data classification and interpolation methods used
• The size and shape of the individual mapping units

• The length of the record.
It must also be noted that where data are used from a number of sources,

and particularly where the area of study crosses administrative boundaries, the
difficulties in data integration are caused by different geographical referencing
systems, data classification and sampling. Hence, the user needs to be aware of
these problems, which are particularly prone when compiling inter-province,
and inter-district data sets. Once, the compatibility between the data acquired
from different suppliers is established, the next stage involves the transfer of
data from a medium of transfer to the GIS. The use of DAT tapes, CD ROMS and
floppy disks is becoming increasingly common for the purpose. At this stage, the
conversion from encoding and structuring system of the source to that of GIS to
be used is important.

(b) Creating digital data sets by manual input

The manual input of data to a GIS involves four main stages :

• Entering the spatial data.

• Entering the attribute data.

• Spatial and attribute data verification and editing.

• Where necessary, linking the spatial to the attribute data.

The manual data input methods depend on whether the database has a vector
topology or grid cell (raster) structure. The most common ways of inputting spatial
data in to a GIS are through:

• Digitisation
• Scanning
With the entity model, geographical data are in the form of points, lines and/

or polygons (areas)/pixels which are defined using a series of coordinates.  These
are obtained by referring to the geographical referencing systems of the map or
aerial photograph, or by overlaying a graticule or grid onto it. The use of digitisers
and the scanners greatly reduce the time and labour involved in writing down
coordinates. We shall, briefly, discuss how the spatial data are created in GIS
core using a scanner.

Scanners

Scanners are the devices for converting analogue data into digital grid-based
images. They are used in spatial data capture to convert a line map to high-resolution
raster images which may be used directly or further processed to get vector
topology. There are two basic types of scanners :

• Scanners that record data on a step-for-step basis, and
• Those that can scan whole document in one operation.
The first type of scanners incorporates a source of illumination on a movable

arm (usually light emitting diodes or a stabilised fluorescent lamp) and a digital
camera with high-resolution lamp.  The camera is usually equipped with special
sensors called Charged Coupled Devices (CCDs) arranged in an array.  These are
semi-conductor devices that translate the photons of light falling on their surface
into counts of electrons, which are then recorded as a digital value.

The movement of either the scanner or the map builds up a digital

54 two-dimensional image of the map. The map to be scanned can be mounted
either on a flat bed, or on a rotating drum. With flatbed scanners, the light source
is moved systematically up and down over the surface of the document.  For
large maps, scanners are used which are mounted on a stand and the illumination
source and camera array are fixed in a position. The map is moved past by a
feeding mechanism. Modern document scanners resemble laser printers in reverse
because the scanning surface is manufactured with a given resolution of light
sensitive spots that can be directly addressed by the software.  There are no
moving parts except a movable light source.  The resolution is determined by the
geometry of the sensor surface and the amount of memory rather than by a
mechanical arm.

The scanned image is always far from perfect even with the best possible
scanners, as it contains all the smudges and defects of the original map.  The
excess data, therefore, in a digital image must be removed to make it usable.

Entering the Attribute Data

Attribute data define the properties of a spatial entity that need to be handled in
the GIS, but which are not spatial. For example, a road may be captured as a set
of contiguous pixels or as a line entity and represented in the spatial part of the
GIS by a certain colour, symbol or data location. Information describing the type
of road may be included in the range of cartographic symbols. The attribute
values associated with the road, such as road width, type of surface, estimated
number of traffic and specific traffic regulation may  also be stored separately

either as spatial information in the GIS in case of relational databases, or input
along with spatial description with the object-oriented data bases.

The attribute data acquired from sources like published record, official
censuses, primary surveys or spread sheets can be used as input into GIS database
either manually or by importing the data using a standard transfer format.

Data Verification and Editing

The spatial data captured into a GIS require verification for the error identification
and corrections so as to ensure the data accuracy. The errors caused during
digitisation may include data omissions, and under/over shoots.  The best way
to check for errors in the spatial data is to produce a computer plot or print of
the data, preferably on translucent sheet, at the same scale as the original.  The
two maps may then be placed over each other on a light table and compared
visually, working systematically from left to right and top to bottom of the map.
Missing data and locational errors should be clearly marked on the printout.
The errors that may arise during the capturing of spatial and attribute data may
be grouped as under :

Spatial data are incomplete or double

The incompleteness in the spatial data arises through omissions in the input of
points, lines, or polygons/area of manually entered data. In scanned data the
omissions are usually in the form of gaps between lines where the raster vector
conversion process has failed to join up all parts of a line.

Spatial data at the wrong scale

The digitising at the wrong scale produces input spatial data at a wrong scale.
In scanned data, the problems usually arise during the geo-referencing process

5 5
when incorrect values are used.

Spatial data are distorted

The spatial data may also be distorted if the base maps used for digitising are
not scale correct.  The aerial photographs, in particular, are characterised by
incorrect scale because of the lens distortions, relief and till displacements.  In
addition, paper maps and field documents used for scanning or digitising may
contain random distortions as a result of having been exposed to rain, sunshine
and frequent folding.  Hence, transformation from one coordinate system to
another may be needed if the coordinate system of the database is different from
that used in the input document or image.

These errors need corrections through various editing and updating functions
as supported directly by most GIS software. The process is time-consuming and
interactive that can take longer time than the data input itself. The data editing is
usually undertaken by viewing the portion of map containing the errors on the
computer screen and correcting them through the software using the keyboard,
screen cursor controlled by a mouse or a small digitiser tablet.

Minor locational errors in a vector database may be corrected by moving the
spatial entity through the screen cursor.  In some GIS, computer commands
may be used directly to move, rotate, erase, insert, stretch or truncate the graphical
entities are required.  Where excess coordinates define a line these may be removed
using ‘weeding’ algorithms.  Attribute values and spatial errors in raster data

must be corrected by changing the value of the faulty cells. Once, the spatial
errors have been corrected, the topology of vector line and polygon networks can
be generated.

Data Conversion

While manipulating and analysing data, the same format should be used for all
data. When different layers are to be used simultaneously, they should all be in
vector or all in raster format. Usually, the conversion is from vector to raster,
because the biggest part of the analysis is done in the raster domain. Vector data
are transformed to raster data by overlaying a grid with a user-defined cell size.

Sometimes, the data in the raster format are converted into vector format.
This is the case especially if one wants to achieve data reduction because the
data storage needed for raster data are much larger than for vector data.

Geographic Data : Linkages and Matching

The linkages of spatial and the attribute data are important in GIS. It must,
therefore, carefully be undertaken. Linking of attribute data with a non-related
spatial data shall lead to chaos in ultimate data analysis. Similarly, matching of
one data layer with another is also significant.

Linkages

A GIS typically links different data sets. Suppose, we want to know the mortality
rate due to malnutrition among children under 10 years of age in any state. If we
have one file that contains the number of children in this age group, and another
that contains the mortality rate from malnutrition, we must first combine or link
the two data files. Once this is done, we can divide one figure by the other to
obtain the desired answer.

56 Exact Matching

Exact matching means when we have information in one computer file about
many geographic features (e.g., towns) and additional information in another file
about the same set of features. The operation to bring them together may easily
be achieved using a key common to both files, i. e. name of the towns. Thus, the
record in each file with the same town name is extracted, and the two are joined
and stored in another file.

Hierarchical Matching

Some types of information, however, are collected in more detail and less frequently
than other types of information. For example, land use data covering a large area
are collected quite frequently. On the other hand, land transformation data are
collected in small areas but at less frequent intervals. If the smaller areas adjust
within the larger ones, then the way to make the data match of the same area is to
use hierarchical matching — add the data for the small areas together until the
grouped areas match the bigger ones and then match them exactly.

Fuzzy Matching

On many occasions, the boundaries of the smaller areas do not match with those
of the larger ones. The problem occurs more often when the environmental data
are involved. For example, crop boundaries that are usually defined by field
edges/boundaries rarely match with the boundaries of the soil types. If we want

to determine the most productive soil for a particular crop, we need to overlay
the two sets and compute crop productivity for each soil type. This is like laying
one map over another and noting the combinations of soil and productivity.

A GIS can carry out all these operations. However, the sets of spatial
information are linked only when they relate to the same geographical area.

Spatial Analysis

The strength of the GIS lies in its analytical capabilities. What distinguish the
GIS from other information systems are its spatial analysis functions. The analysis
functions use the spatial and non-spatial attributes in the database to answer
questions about the real world. Geographic analysis facilitates the study of real-
world processes by developing and applying models. Such models provide the
underlying trends in geographic data and thus, make new possibilities available.
The objective of geographic analysis is to transform data into useful information
to satisfy the requirements of the decision-makers. For example, GIS may
effectively be used to predict future trends over space and time related to variety
of phenomena. However, before undertaking any GIS based analysis, one needs
to identify the problem and define purpose of the analysis. It requires step – by –
step procedures to arrive at the conclusions. The following spatial analysis
operation may be undertaken using GIS :

(i) Overlay analysis (ii) Buffer analysis

(iii) Network analysis (iv) Digital Terrain Model
However, under the constraints of time and space only the overlay and buffer

analysis operations will be dealt herewith.

Overlay Analysis Operations

The hallmark of GIS is overlay operations. An integration of multiple layers of
maps using overlay operations is an important analysis function. In other words, 5 7

GIS makes it possible to overlay two or more thematic layers of maps of the same
area to obtain a new map layer (Fig. 4.7). The overlay operations of a GIS are

similar to the sieve mapping, i.e., the overlaying of tracing of maps on a light
table to make comparisons and obtain an output map.

Map overlay has many applications. It can be used to study the changes in
land use/land cover over two different periods in time and analyse the land
transformations. For example, Fig. 4.8 depicts urban land use during 1974 and
2001. When the two maps overlaid, the changes in urban land use have been
obtained (Fig. 4.9) and the urban sprawl is mapped during the given time period
(Fig. 4.10). Similarly, overlay analysis is also useful in suitability analysis of the
given land use for proposed land uses.

Buffer Operation

Buffer operation is another important spatial analysis function in GIS. A buffer
of a certain specified distance can be created along any point, line or area feature
(Fig. 4.11). It is useful in locating the areas/population benefitted or denied of
the facilities and services, such as hospitals, medical stores, post office, asphalt
roads, regional parks, etc. Similarly, it can also be used to study the impact of
point sources of air, noise or water pollution on human health and the size of the
population so affected. This kind of analysis is called proximity analysis. The
buffer operation will generate polygon feature types irrespective of geographic
features and delineates spatial proximity. For example, numbers of household
living within one-kilometre buffer from a chemical industrial unit are affected by
industrial waste discharged from the unit.

Arc View/ArcGIS, Geomedia Quantum GIS free opensoftware and all other
GIS softwares provide modules for buffer analysis along point, line and area
features. For example, by using appropriate commands of either of the available
software, one can create buffers of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 kilometres around the cities
having a major hospital located. As a case study, point location of Saharanpur,

mapped (Fig. 4.12) and the buffer have been created from the cities where major
hospitals are found. One can observe that the areas closer to the cities are better

60 served, people living away from the cities have to travel
long distances to utilise the medical services and their
areas that are least benefitted (Fig. 4.13).

Glossary
Bar Graph : A series of columns or bars drawn proportional in length to the quantities they

represent. They are drawn on a selected scale. They may be drawn either horizontally
or vertically.

Central Tendency : The tendency of quantitative data to cluster around some value.

Choropleth Maps : Maps drawn on quantitative areal basis, calculated as average values
per unit of area within specific administrative units, e.g. density of population and
percentage of urban to total population. Distribution of a given phenomenon is
shown by various shades of a colour or intensity.

Class Intervals : The difference between the lower and upper limits of any class of a frequency
distribution is known as its class interval.

Correlation Co-efficient : A measure of the degree and direction of relationship between
two variables.

Cumulative Frequency : The measurement of distribution of values in the different class
intervals expressed as a percentage of the total frequencies either above or below
specified value.

Dispersion : The degree of internal variations in the different values of a variable.

Flow Maps : Maps in which the “flow” or movement of people or commodities is represented
by riband whose thickness is proportional to the quantity of goods or the number of
people moving along different routes.

Histogram : A graphical representation of a frequency distribution, such as seasonal
frequencies of rainfall.

Mean Deviation : A measure of dispersion derives from the average of deviations from some
central value. Such deviations are taken absolutely, i.e., their signs are ignored.
The central value is generally mean or median.

Median : It is the value which divides the number of observations in such a way that half
the value are less than this value and half of them are more. If the values of a
variable are arranged in either ascending of descending order, the median is the
middle value.

Mode : The mode is that value of a variable which occurs maximum number of times.

Pie Diagram : A circular diagram in which a circle is divided into sectors for presenting data
in percentage.

Standard Deviation : The most commonly used measure of dispersion. The standard deviation
is the positive square root of the mean of the squares of deviations from the mean.

Tabulation : The process of putting raw data into a systematically arranged tabular form.

Variable : Any characteristic which varies. A quantitative variable is a characteristic which
has different values; the differences of which are quantitatively measurable. Rainfall,
for example, is a quantitative variables, because the differences in its different
values at different places or at different times are quantitatively measurable. A
qualitative variable on the other hand, is the characteristic; the different values of
which cannot be measured quantitatively. Sex, for example, is a qualitative variable,
it can be either male or female. A qualitative variable is also known as an attribute.
