1.1 A Lakh Varieties!
Eshwarappa is a farmer in Chintamani,
a town in Karnataka. He visits the
market regularly to buy seeds for his
rice field. During one such visit he
overheard a conversation between
Ramanna and Lakshmamma. Ramanna
said, “Earlier our country had about a
lakh varieties of rice. Farmers used to
preserve different varieties of seeds
and use them to grow rice. Now, we
only have a handful of varieties. Also,
farmers have to come to the market to buy seeds”.
Lakshmamma said, “There is a seed bank near my house. So far, they
have collected about a hundred indigenous varieties of rice seeds from
different places. You can also buy seeds from there.”
You may have heard the word ‘lakh’
before. Do you know how big one lakh is? Let
us find out.
Eshwarappa shared this incident with his
daughter Roxie and son Estu .
Estu was surprised to know that there
were about one lakh varieties of rice in this
country. He wondered “One lakh! So far I
have only tasted 3 varieties. If we tried a new
variety each day, would we even come close
to tasting all the varieties in a lifetime of 100
years?”
What do you think? Guess.

Roxie and Estu found that if they ate
one variety of rice a day, they would come
nowhere close to a lakh in a lifetime! Roxie
suggests, “What if we ate 2 varieties of
rice every day? Would we then be able to
eat 1 lakh varieties of rice in 100 years?”
What if a person ate 3 varieties of rice every day? Will they be able to
taste all the lakh varieties in a 100 year lifetime? Find out.
Estu said, “We know how many days there are in a year — 365, if
we ignore leap years. If we live for y years, the number of days in our
lifetime will be 365 × y.”

Choose a number for y. How close to one lakh is the number of days in
y years, for the y of your choice?
Figure it Out
1. According to the 2011 Census, the population of the town of
Chintamani was about 75,000. How much less than one lakh is 75,000?
2. The estimated population of Chintamani in the year 2024 is 1,06,000.
How much more than one lakh is 1,06,000?
3. By how much did the population of Chintamani increase from 2011
to 2024?

Getting a Feel of Large Numbers
You may have come across interesting facts like these:
• The world’s tallest statue is the ‘Statue of Unity’
in Gujarat depicting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Its
height is about 180 metres.
• Kunchikal waterfall in Karnataka is said to drop
from a height of about 450 metres.
It is not always easy to get a sense of how big these measurements
are. But, we can get a better sense of their size when we compare them
with something familiar. Let us see an example.
Look at the picture on the right. Somu is 1 metre tall. If each floor
is about four times his height, what is the approximate height of the
building?
Which is taller — The Statue of Unity or this building? How much taller?
____________m.

How much taller is the
Kunchikal
waterfall
than
Somu's
building?
____________m.
How many floors should
Somu’s building have to be
as high as the waterfall?
____________ .

500

400

We can see that the
height of the Statue of Unity
is close to 4 times the height
of Somu’s building.

Is One Lakh a Very Large Number?
Eshwarappa asked Roxie and Estu, “Is a lakh big or
small?”
Roxie feels that 1 lakh is a large number:
• “We had one lakh varieties of rice — that
is a lot.”
• “Living 1 lakh days would mean living for 274
years — that is a really long time!”
• “If 1 lakh people stood shoulder to shoulder in a line they could
stretch as far as 38 kilometres.”
Estu, however, thinks it is not that big:
• “Do you know that the cricket stadium in
Ahmedabad has a seating capacity of more
than 1 lakh? One lakh people in such a small
area!”
• “Most humans have 80,000 to 1,20,000 hairs on
their heads. Imagine, 1 lakh hairs fit in such a
tiny space!”
• “I heard that there are some species of fish
where a female fish can lay almost one lakh
eggs at once very comfortably. Some even lay tens of lakhs of eggs
at a time.”
How do you view a lakh — is a lakh big or small?

Reading and Writing Numbers
We have already been using commas for 5-digit numbers like 45,830 in
the Indian place value system. As numbers grow bigger, using commas
helps in reading the numbers easily. We use a comma in between the
digits representing the “ten thousands” place and the “one lakh” place
as you have seen just before (1,00,000).
The number name of 12,78,830 is twelve lakh seventy eight thousand
eight hundred thirty.
Similarly, the number 15,75,000 in words is fifteen lakh seventy five
thousand.
Write each of the numbers given below in words:
(a) 3,00,600

Note to the Teacher: Encourage students to make connections between these facts.
For example, can the whole population of Chintamani fit in the stadium? How
can we imagine the line of 38 km, having a lakh people, sitting next to each
other in the stadium?

What if we press the +10,00,000 button ten times? What number
will come up? How many zeroes will it have? What should we call it?
The number will be 100 lakhs, which is also called a crore. 1 crore is
written as 1,00,00,000 — it is 1 followed by seven zeroes.

1.3 Of Crores and Crores!
The table below shows some numbers according to both the Indian
system and the American system (also called the International system)
of naming numerals and placing commas. Observe the placement of
commas in both systems.

One billion

Notice that in the Indian system, commas are placed to group the
digits in a 3-2-2-2... pattern from right to left (thousands, lakhs, crores,
etc.). In the American system, the digits are grouped uniformly in a
3-3-3-3… pattern from right to left (thousands, millions, billions, etc.).
The Indian system of naming numbers is also followed in Bhutan,
Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Afghanistan, and
Myanmar. The words lakh and crore originate from the Sanskrit words
lakṣha (लक्ष) and koṭi (कोटि‍). The American system is also used in many
countries.
Observe the number of zeroes in 1 lakh and 1 crore.
1 lakh, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 5 zeroes.
1 crore, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 7 zeroes.
A lakh is a hundred times a thousand, a crore is a hundred times a
lakh and an arab is a hundred times a crore (i.e., a hundred thousand
is 1 lakh, 100 lakhs is 1 crore, and 100 crores is 1 arab).

What do you think of this conversation? Have you read or heard
such headlines or statements?
Very often, exact numbers are not required and just an approximation
is sufficient. For example, according to the 2011 census, the population
of Chintamani town is 76,068. Instead, saying that the population is
about 75,000 is enough to give an idea of how big the quantity is.

Bappi, call and
check if Toofan
Express is on time.

What
number
did you
call?
I called the
rounded off
number, of course!
My teacher told
us that efficient
people deal with
rounded off
numbers.

There are situations where it makes sense to round up a number
(rounding up is when the approximated number is more than the actual
number). For example, if a school has 732 people including students,
teachers and staff: the principal might order 750 sweets instead of
700 sweets.
There are situations where it is better to round down (rounding down
is when the approximated number is less than the actual number). For
example, if the cost of an item is ₹470, the shopkeeper may say that the
cost is around ₹450 instead of saying it is around ₹500.
Think and share situations where it is appropriate to (a) round up,
(b) round down, (c) either rounding up or rounding down is okay and
(d) when exact numbers are needed.

(b) 29,05,32,481
I have a number for which all five nearest neighbours are
5,00,00,000. What could the number be? How many such numbers

Observe the number of digits in the two numbers being multiplied
and their product in each case. Is there any connection between the
numbers being multiplied and the number of digits in their product?
Roxie says that the product of two 2-digit numbers can only be a 3- or
a 4-digit number. Is she correct?
Should we try all possible multiplications with 2-digit numbers to tell
whether Roxie’s claim is true? Or is there a better way to find out?
She explains her reasoning: “We want to
know about the number of digits in the product
of two 2-digit numbers. To know the smallest
such product I took 10 × 10, so all other products
will be greater than 100.
To know the greatest such product I
multiplied the smallest 3-digit numbers (100
× 100) to get 10,000; so the product of all the
2-digit multiplications will be less than 10,000.”
Can multiplying a 3-digit number with another 3-digit number give a
4-digit number?
Can multiplying a 4-digit number with a 2-digit number give a 5-digit
number?

1.6 Did You Ever Wonder…?
Estu is amused by all these interesting facts about large numbers. While
thinking about these, he came up with an unusual question, “Could the
entire population of Mumbai fit into 1 lakh buses?”
What do you think?
How can we find out?
Let us assume a bus can accommodate 50 people. Then 1 lakh buses
can accommodate 1 lakh × 50 = 50 lakh people.

The population of Mumbai is more than 1 crore 24 lakhs (we saw
this in an earlier table). So, the entire population of Mumbai cannot fit
in 1 lakh buses.
The RMS Titanic ship carried about 2500 passengers. Can the population
of Mumbai fit into 5000 such ships?

We came across large numbers — lakhs, crores and arabs; millions
and billions. We learnt how to read and write these numbers in the
Indian and American/International naming systems.
(a) 1 lakh is 1 followed by 5 zeroes: 1,00,000
(b) 1 crore is 1 followed by 7 zeroes: 1,00,00,000
(c) 1 million is 1 followed by 6 zeroes: 1,000,000 (which is also ten
lakhs)
(d) 1 arab is 1 followed by 9 zeroes: 1,000,000,000 (which is also 100
crore or 1 billion)
We generally round up or round down large numbers. Many times it
is enough just to know roughly how big or small something is.
To get a sense of large numbers or quantities, we can check how
many times bigger they are compared to numbers or quantities that
are more familiar.
We saw how to factorise numbers and regroup them to make
multiplications simpler.
We carried out interesting thought experiments such as — “Would
one be able to watch 1000 movies in a year?”

ARITHMETIC
EXPRESSIONS

2.1 Simple Expressions
You may have seen mathematical phrases like 13 + 2, 20 – 4, 12 × 5, and
18 ÷ 3. Such phrases are called arithmetic expressions.
Every arithmetic expression has a value which is the number it
evaluates to. For example, the value of the expression 13 + 2 is 15. This
expression can be read as ‘13 plus 2’ or ‘the sum of 13 and 2’.
We use the equality sign ‘=’ to denote the relationship between an
arithmetic expression and its value. For example:
13 + 2 = 15.
Example 1: Mallika spends ₹25 every day for lunch at school. Write
the expression for the total amount she spends on lunch in a week
from Monday to Friday.
The expression for the total amount is 5 × 25.
5 × 25 is “5 times 25” or “the product of 5 and 25”.
Different expressions can have the same value. Here are multiple
ways to express the number 12, using two numbers and any of the four
operations +, – , × and ÷:
10 + 2, 15 – 3, 3 × 4, 24 ÷ 2.
Choose your favourite number and write as many expressions as you
can having that value.

Comparing Expressions
As we compare numbers using ‘=’, ‘<’ and ‘>’ signs, we can also compare
expressions. We compare expressions based on their values and write
the ‘equal to’, ‘greater than’ or ‘less than’ sign accordingly. For example,
10 + 2 > 7 + 1

Example 2: Which is greater? 1023 + 125 or 1022 + 128?
Imagining a situation could help us answer this
without finding the values. Raja had 1023 marbles
and got 125 more today. Now he has 1023 + 125
marbles. Joy had 1022 marbles and got 128
more today. Now he has 1022 + 128 marbles. Who
has more?
This situation can be represented as shown in
the picture on the right. To begin with, Raja had 1
more marble than Joy. But Joy got 3 more marbles
than Raja today. We can see that Joy has (two)
more marbles than Raja now.
That is,
			

Raja (1023 + 125)

Joy (1022 + 128)

1023 + 125 < 1022 + 128.

Example 3: Which is greater? 113 – 25 or 112 – 24?
Imagine a situation, Raja had 113 marbles and lost
25 of them. He has 113 – 25 marbles. Joy had 112
marbles and lost 24 today. He has 112 – 24 marbles.
Who has more marbles left with them?
Raja had 1 marble more than Joy. But he also
lost 1 marble more than Joy did. Therefore, they
have an equal number of marbles now.
That is,
113 – 25 = 112 – 24.

2.2 Reading and Evaluating Complex Expressions
Sometimes, when an expression is not accompanied by a context, there
can be more than one way of evaluating its value. In such cases, we
need some tools and rules to specify how exactly the expression has to
be evaluated.
To give an example with language, look
at the following sentences:
(a) Sentence: “Shalini sat next to a
friend with toys”.
	 Meaning: The friend has toys and
Shalini sat next to her.
  entence: “Shalini sat next to a
(b) S
friend, with toys”.
Meaning: Shalini has the toys
and she sat with them next to her
friend.
This sentence without the punctuation could have been interpreted
in two different ways. The appropriate use of a comma specifies how
the sentence has to be understood.
Let us see an expression that can be evaluated in more than one way.
Example 4: Mallesh brought 30 marbles to the playground. Arun
brought 5 bags of marbles with 4 marbles in each bag. How many
marbles did Mallesh and Arun bring to the playground?
Mallesh summarized this by writing the mathematical expression —
30 + 5 × 4.

26

Chapter-2.indd 26

4/12/2025 11:27:34 AM

Arithmetic Expressions

Without knowing the context behind this expression, Purna found
the value of this expression to be 140. He added 30 and 5 first, to get 35,
and then multiplied 35 by 4 to get 140.
Mallesh found the value of this expression to be 50. He multiplied 5
and 4 first to get 20 and added 20 to 30 to get 50.
In this case, Mallesh is right. But why did Purna get it wrong?
Just looking at the expression 30 + 5 × 4, it is not clear whether we
should do the addition first or multiplication.
Just as punctuation marks are used to resolve confusions in language,
brackets and the notion of terms are used in mathematics to resolve
confusions in evaluating expressions.

Brackets in Expressions
In the expression to find the number of marbles — 30 + 5 × 4 — we had
to first multiply 5 and 4, and then add this product to 30. This order of
operations is clarified by the use of brackets as follows:
30 + (5 × 4).
When evaluating an expression having brackets, we need to first find
the values of the expressions inside the brackets before performing
other operations. So, in the above expression, we first find the value
of 5 × 4, and then do the addition. Thus, this expression describes the
number of marbles:
30 + (5 × 4 ) = 30 + 20 = 50.
Example 5: Irfan bought a pack of biscuits for ₹15 and a packet of toor
dal for ₹56. He gave the shopkeeper ₹100. Write an expression that can
help us calculate the change Irfan will get back from the shopkeeper.
Irfan spent ₹15 on a biscuit packet and ₹56 on toor dal. So, the total
cost in rupees is 15 + 56. He gave ₹100 to the shopkeeper. So, he should
get back 100 minus the total cost. Can we write that expression as—
100 – 15 + 56 ?
Can we first subtract 15 from 100 and then add 56 to the result? We
will get 141. It is absurd that he gets more money than he paid the
shopkeeper!
We can use brackets in this case:
100 – (15 + 56).
Evaluating the expression within the brackets first, we get 100 minus
71, which is 29. So, Irfan will get back ₹29.

Terms in Expressions
Suppose we have the expression 30 + 5 × 4 without any brackets. Does
it have no meaning?
When there are expressions having multiple operations, and the
order of operations is not specified by the brackets, we use the notion
of terms to determine the order.
Terms are the parts of an expression separated by a ‘+’ sign. For
example, in 12+7, the terms are 12 and 7, as marked below.
12 + 7 =

12

+

7

We will keep marking each term of an expression as above. Note
that this way of marking the terms is not a usual practice. This will be
done until you become familiar with this concept.
Now, what are the terms in 83 – 14? We know that subtracting a
number is the same as adding the inverse of the number. Recall that
the inverse of a given number has the sign opposite to it. For example,
the inverse of 14 is –14, and the inverse of –14 is 14. Thus, subtracting
14 from 83 is the same as adding –14 to 83. That is,
83 – 14 =

83

+

– 14

Thus, the terms of the expression 83 – 14 are 83 and –14.
Check if replacing subtraction by addition in this way does not change
the value of the expression, by taking different examples.
Can you explain why subtracting a number is the same as adding its
inverse, using the Token Model of integers that we saw in the Class
6 textbook of mathematics?

Try
This

All subtractions in an expression are converted to additions in this
manner to identify the terms.
Here are some more examples of expressions and their terms:

Note that 6 × 5, 4 × 6 are single terms as they do not have any ‘+’ sign.

Now we will see how terms are used to determine the order of
operations to find the value of an expression.
We will start with expressions having only additions (with all the
subtractions suitably converted into additions).
Does changing the order in which the terms are added give different
values?

Swapping and Grouping
Let us consider a simple expression having only two terms.
Example 6: Madhu is flying a drone from a terrace. The drone goes 6 m
up and then 4 m down. Write an expression to show how high the final
position of the drone is from the terrace.
The drone is 6 – 4 = 2 m above the terrace. Writing it as sum of terms:
6

+

–4

=

2

Will the sum change if we swap the terms?
–4

+

6

=

2

It doesn’t in this case.
We already know that swapping the terms does not change the sum
when both the terms are positive numbers.
Will this also hold when there are terms having negative numbers as
well? Take some more expressions and check.

29

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of

This

Thus, in an expression having two terms, swapping them does not
change the value.
Term 1

+

Term 2 =

Term 2

+

Term 1

Now consider an expression having three terms: (–7) + 10 + (–11). Let
us add these terms in the following two different orders:
–7

+

10

+

– 11

(adding the first two terms and then adding their sum to the third
term)
–7

+

10

+

– 11

(adding the last two terms and then adding their sum to the first
term)
What do you see? The sums are the same in both cases.
Again, we know that while adding positive numbers, grouping them
in any of the above two ways gives the same sum.
Will this also hold when there are terms having negative numbers as
well? Take some more expressions and check.
Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of
integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics?

Try
This

Thus, grouping the terms of an expression in either of the following
ways gives the same value.
Term 1 + Term 2 + Term 3

=

Term 1 + Term 2 + Term 3

Let us consider the expression (–7) + 10 + (–11) again. What happens
when we change the order and add –7 and –11 first, and then add this
sum to 10? Will we get the same sum as before?
We see that adding the terms of the expression (–7) + 10 + (–11) in
any order gives the same sum of –8.

Arithmetic Expressions

Does adding the terms of an expression in any order give the same
value? Take some more expressions and check. Consider expressions
with more than 3 terms also.
Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of
integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics?

Try
This

Thus, the addition of terms in any order gives the same value.
Therefore, in an expression having only additions, it does not matter
in what order the terms are added: they all give the same value.
Now let us consider expressions having multiplication and division
also, without the order of operations specified by the brackets. The
values of such expressions are found by first evaluating the terms.
Once all the terms are evaluated, they are added.
For example, the expression 30 + 5 × 4 is evaluated as follows:
30 + 5 × 4 =

30

+

5×4

=

30

+

=

20

50

The expression 5 × (3 + 2) + 78 + 3 is evaluated as follows:
5 × (3 + 2) + 78 + 3 =

5 × (3 + 2)

+

7×8

+

3

Where (3+2) is first evaluated and this sum is multiplied by 5 (= 25).
The expression 7 × 8 is evaluated (= 56). This simplifies to 25 + 56 + 3 =
84.
Manasa is adding a long list of numbers. It took her five
minutes to add them all and she got the answer 11749. Then
she realised that she had forgotten to include the fourth
number 9055. Does she have to start all over again?

In mathematics we use the phrase commutative property
of addition instead of saying “swapping terms does not
change the sum”. Similarly, “grouping does not change the sum” is
called the associative property of addition.

Example 7: Amu, Charan, Madhu, and John went to a hotel and ordered
four dosas. Each dosa cost ₹23, and they wish to thank the waiter by
tipping ₹5. Write an expression describing the total cost.
Cost of 4 dosas = 4 × 23
Can the total amount with tip be written as 4 × 23 + 5? Evaluating it,
we get

Let us find the value of this expression,
200 – (40 + 3).
We first evaluate the expression inside the
bracket to 43 and then subtract it from 200.
But it is simpler to first subtract 40 from 200:
200 – 40 = 160.
And then subtract 3 from 160:
160 – 3 = 157.
What we did here was 200 – 40 – 3. Notice, that we did not do
200 – 40 + 3.
So,
200 – (40 + 3) = 200 – 40 – 3.
Example 12: We also saw this earlier in the case of Irfan purchasing a
biscuit packet (₹15) and a toor dal packet (₹56). When he paid ₹100, the
change he gets in rupees is:
100 – (15 + 56) = 29.
The change could also have been calculated as follows:
(a) First subtract the cost of the biscuit packet (15) from 100:
100 – 15 = 85.
This is the amount the shopkeeper owes Irfan if he had
purchased only the biscuits. As he has purchased toor dal
also, its cost is taken from this remaining amount of 85.
(b) So, to find the change, we need to subtract the cost of toor
dal from 85.
85 – 56 = 29.
What we have done here is 100 – 15 – 56. So,
100 – (15 + 56) = 100 – 15 – 56.
Notice how upon removing the brackets preceded by a negative
sign, the signs of the terms inside the brackets change. Observe
35

Chapter-2.indd 35

4/12/2025 11:27:35 AM

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

the signs of 40 and 3 in the first example, and that of 15 and 56 in
the second.
Example 13: Consider the expression 500 – (250 – 100). Is it possible to
write this expression without the brackets?
To evaluate this expression, we need to subtract 250 – 100 = 150
from 500:
500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 150 = 350.
If we were to directly subtract 250 from 500, then we would have
subtracted 100 more than what we needed to. So, we should add back
that 100 to 500 – 250 to make the expression take the same value as 500
– (250 – 100). This sequence of operations is 500 – 250+100. Thus,
500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 250 + 100.
Check that 500 – (250 – 100) is not equal to 500 – 250 – 100.
Notice again that when the brackets preceded by a negative sign
are removed, the signs of the terms inside the brackets change. In this
case, the signs of 250 and – 100 change to – 250 and 100.
Example 14: Hira has a rare coin collection. She has 28 coins in one bag
and 35 coins in another. She gifts her friend 10 coins from the second
bag. Write an expression for the number of coins left with Hira.
This can be expressed by 28 + (35 – 10).
We know that this is the same as 28 + (35 + (–10)). Since the terms
can be added in any order, this expression can simply be written as
28 + 35 + (–10), or 28 + 35 – 10. Thus,
28 + (35 – 10) = 28 + 35 – 10 = 53.
When the brackets are NOT preceded by a negative sign, the terms
within them do not change their signs upon removing the brackets.
Notice the sign of the terms 35 and – 10 in the above expression.
Rather than simply remembering rules for when to change the sign and
when not to, you can figure it out for yourself by thinking about the
meanings of the expressions.

This expression means 24 more than
2 × 43. But, we want an expression
which means twice or double of 43 + 24.
We can make use of brackets to write
such an expression:
2 × (43 + 24).
So, we can say that together they have
to pay 2 × (43 + 24). This is also the same
as paying for two vegetable cutlets and
two rasgullas:
2 × 43 + 2 × 24.
Therefore,

Example 16: In the Republic Day parade, there are boy scouts and girl
guides marching together. The scouts march in 4 rows with 5 scouts in
each row. The guides march in 3 rows with 5 guides in each row (see
the figure below). How many scouts and guides are marching in this
parade?
The number of boy scouts marching is 4 × 5. The number of girl
guides marching is 3 × 5.
The total number of
scouts and guides will be
3×5
4 × 5 + 3 × 5.
This can also be found
by first finding the total
number of rows, i.e., 4 +
(4+3) × 5
3, and then multiplying
their sum by the number
4×5
of children in each row.
Thus, the number of boys
and girls can be found by
(4 + 3) × 5.
Therefore, 4 × 5 + 3 × 5
= (4 + 3) × 5.

(4 + 3) × 5 = 7 × 5 = 35
5 × 4 + 3 ≠ 5 × (4 + 3). Can you explain why?
Is 5 × (4 + 3) = 5 × (3 + 4) = (3 + 4) × 5?
The observations that we have made in the previous two examples
can be seen in a general way as follows.
Consider 10 × 98 + 3 × 98. This means taking the sum of 10 times 98
and 3 times 98.
98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98
10 times

3 times

Clearly, this is the same as 10 + 3 = 13 times 98. Thus,
10 × 98 +3 × 98 = (10 + 3) × 98.
Writing this equality the other way, we get
(10 + 3) 98 = 10 × 98 + 3 × 98.
Swapping the numbers in the products above, this property can be
seen in the following form:
98 × 10 + 9 × 83 = 98 (10 + 3), and
98 (10 + 3) = 98 × 10 + 98 × 3.
Similarly, let us consider the expression 14 × 10 – 6 × 10. This means
subtracting 6 times 10 from 14 times 10.
14 times

10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10
Clearly, this is 14 – 6 = 8 times 10. Thus,
14 × 10 – 6 × 10 = (14 – 6) × 10,
or
(14 – 6) × 10 = 14 × 10 – 6 × 10
This property can be nicely summed up as follows:
The multiple of a sum (difference) is the same as the sum (difference)
of the multiples.

simple expressions and their values.
We learnt how to compare certain expressions through reasoning
instead of bluntly evaluating them.
To help read and evaluate complex expressions without confusion,
we use terms and brackets.
When an expression is written as a sum of terms, changing the order
of the terms or grouping the terms does not change the value of the
expression. This is because the “commutative property of addition”
and the “associative property of addition”, respectively.
To evaluate expressions within brackets, we saw that when we
remove brackets preceded by a negative sign, the terms within the
bracket change their sign.
We also learnt about the “distributive property” — multiplying a
number with an expression inside brackets is equal to the multiplying
the number with each term in the bracket.

Arithmetic Expressions

Expression Engineer!
Using three 3’s along with the four operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division) and brackets as needed we can create
several expressions. For example, (3 + 3)/3 = 2, 3 + 3 – 3 = 3, 3 ×
3 + 3 = 12, and so on.
Using four 4’s, create expressions to get all values from 1 to 20.
Using the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 exactly once in any order get
as many values as possible between – 10 and +10.
Using the numbers 0 to 9 exactly once in any order, make an
expression with a value 100.
What other similar interesting questions can you ask?

A PEEK BEYOND
THE POINT

3.1 The Need for Smaller Units
Sonu’s mother was fixing a
toy. She was trying to join
two pieces with the help of
a
screw.
Sonu
was
watching his mother with
great curiosity. His mother
was unable to join the
pieces. Sonu asked why.
His mother said that the
screw was not of the
right size.
She brought another screw from the box and was able to fix the toy.
The two screws looked the same to Sonu. But when he observed them
closely, he saw they were of slightly different lengths.
Sonu was fascinated
by how such a small
difference in lengths
could matter so much.
He was curious to
know the difference
in lengths. He was also
curious to know how
little the difference
was
because
the
screws looked nearly
the same.
In the following figure, screws are placed above a scale. Measure
them and write their length in the space provided.

Which scale helped you measure the length of the screws accurately?
Why?
What is the meaning of 2 7 cm (the length of the first screw)?
10
As seen on the ruler, the unit length between two consecutive
numbers is divided into 10 equal parts. To get the length 2 7 cm, we
10
go from 0 to 2 and then take seven parts of 1 . The length of the screw
10
7
is 2 cm and
cm. Similarly, we can make sense of the length 3 2 cm.
10
10
We read 2 7 cm as two and seven-tenth centimeters, and 3 2 cm
10
10
as three and two-tenth centimeters.
Can you explain why the unit was divided into smaller parts to measure
the screws?
Measure the following objects using a scale and write their
measurements in centimeters (as shown earlier for the lengths of the
screws): pen, sharpener, and any other object of your choice.
Write the measurements of the objects shown in the picture:

As seen here, when exact measures are required we can make use of
smaller units of measurement.

3.2 A Tenth Part
The length of the pencil shown in the figure below is 3 4 units, which can
10
also be read as 3 units and four one-tenths, i.e., (3 × 1) + 4 × 1 units.

units make one unit.

Sonu is measuring some of his body parts. The length of Sonu’s lower
arm is 2 7 units, and that of his upper arm is 3 6 units. What is the
10
10
total length of his arm?
To get the total length, let us see the lower and upper arm length as
2 units and 7 one-tenths, and 3 units and 6 one-tenths, respectively.
So, there are (2 + 3) units and (7 + 6) one-tenths. Together, they make
5 units and 13 one-tenths. But 13 one-tenths is 1 unit and 3 one-tenths.
So, the total length is 6 units and 3 one-tenths.

units, which can also be said as

8 units and 9 one-tenths. It is folded
in half along its length. What is its
length now?

We can say that its
4
length is between 4
10
5
units and 4
units. But
10
we cannot state its exact
measurement, since there
are no markings. Earlier,
we split a unit into 10
one-tenths to measure
smaller lengths. We can
do something similar and
split each one-tenth into
10 parts.
What is the length of this
smaller part? How many
such smaller parts make
a unit length?
As shown in the figure
below, each one-tenth has
10 smaller parts, and there are 10 one-tenths in a unit; therefore, there
will be 100 smaller parts in a unit. Therefore, one part’s length will
1
be
of a unit.

Returning to our question, what is the length of the folded paper?

We can see that it ends at 4
, read as 4 units and 4 one-tenths

and 5 one-hundredths.
How many one-hundredths make one-tenth? Can we also say that
the length is 4 units and 45 one-hundredths?

3.4 Decimal Place Value
You may have noticed that whenever we need to measure something
more accurately, we split a part into 10 (smaller) equal parts ― we split
a unit into 10 one-tenths and then split each one-tenth into 10, onehundredths and then we use these smaller parts to measure.
58

Chapter-3.indd 58

4/12/2025 11:39:20 AM

A Peek Beyond the Point

Can we not split a unit into 4 equal parts, 5 equal parts, 8 equal parts,
or any other number of equal parts instead?
Yes, we can. The example below
compares how the same length is
represented when the unit is split
into 10 equal parts and when the
unit is split into 4 equal parts.
If an even more precise measure
is needed, each quarter can further
be split into four equal parts. Each
part then measures 1 of a unit, i.e.,
16
16 such parts make 1 unit.

Then why split a unit into 10 parts every time?
The reason is the special role that 10 plays in the Indian place value
system. For a whole number written in the Indian place value system —
for example, 281 — the place value of 2 is hundreds (100), that of 8 is
tens (10), and that of 4 is one (1). Each place value is 10 times bigger
than the one immediately to its right. Equivalently, each place value is
10 times smaller than the one immediately to its left:
10 ones make 1 ten,
10 tens make 1 hundred,
10 hundreds make 1 thousand, and so on.

In order to extend this system of writing numbers to quantities
smaller than one, we divide one into 10 equal parts. What does
this give? It gives one-tenth. Further dividing it into 10 parts gives
one-hundredth, and so on.

This way of writing numbers is called the “decimal system” since it
is based on the number 10; “decem” means ten in Latin, which in turn
is cognate to the Sanskrit daśha meaning 10, with similar words for
10 occurring across many Indian languages including Odia, Konkani,
Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Bodo, and Assamese. We shall learn
about other ways of writing numbers in later grades.
How Big?
We already know that a hundred 10s make 1000, and a hundred 100s
make 10000.
We can ask similar questions about fractional parts:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)

How many thousandths make one unit?
How many thousandths make one tenth?
How many thousandths make one hundredth?
How many tenths make one ten?
How many hundredths make one ten?

Make a few more questions of this kind and answer them.

Notation, Writing and Reading of Numbers
We have been writing numbers in a particular way, say 456, instead of
writing them as 4 × 100 (4 hundreds) + 5 × 10 (5 tens) + 6 × 1 (6 ones).
Similarly, can we skip writing tenths and hundredths?

Since these are different quantities, we need to have distinct ways
of writing them.
To identify the place value where integers end and the fractional
parts start, we use a point or period (‘.’) as a separator, called a
decimal point.
The above quantities in decimal notation are then:

Thus decimal notation is a natural extension of the Indian place
value system to numbers also having fractional parts. Just as 705 means
1
7 × 100 + 5 × 1, the number 70.5 means 7 × 10 + 5 ×
, and 7.05 means
10
1
7 × 1 +5 ×
.
100
We have seen how to write numbers using the decimal point (‘.’). But
how do we read/say these numbers?
We know that 705 is read as seven hundred and five.
70.5 is read as seventy point five, short for seventy and five-tenths.
7.05 is read as seven point zero five, short for seven and five
hundredths.
0.274 is read as zero point two seven four. We don’t read it as zero
point two hundred and seventy four as 0.274 means 2 one-tenths
and 7 one-hundredths and 4 one-thousandths.
Make a place value table similar to the one above. Write each quantity
in decimal form and in terms of place value, and read the number:
(a) 2 ones, 3 tenths and 5 hundredths
(b) 1 ten and 5 tenths
(c) 4 ones and 6 hundredths

We start by comparing the most significant digits (digits with the
highest place value) of the two numbers. If the digits are the same,
we compare the next smaller place value. We keep going till we find
a position where the digits are not equal. The number with the larger
digit at this position is the greater of the two.
Why can we stop comparing at this point? Can we be sure that
whatever digits are there after this will not affect our

Closest Decimals
Consider the decimal numbers 0.9, 1.1, 1.01, and 1.11. Identify the
decimal number that is closest to 1.
Let us compare the decimal numbers. Arranging these in ascending
order, we get 0.9 < 1 < 1.01 < 1.1 < 1.11. Among the neighbours of 1, 1.01
is 1/100 away from 1 whereas 0.9 is 10/100 away from 1. Therefore,
1.01 is closest to 1.
Which of the above is closest to 1.09?
Which among these is closest to 4: 3.56, 3.65, 3.099?
Which among these is closest to 1: 0.8, 0.69, 1.08?

Estimating Sums and Differences
Sonu has observed sums and differences of decimal numbers and says,
“If we add two decimal numbers, then the sum will always be greater
than the sum of their whole number parts. Also, the sum will always be
less than 2 more than the sum of their whole number parts.”
Let us use an example to understand what his claim means:
If the two numbers to be added are 25.936 and 8.202, the claim is
that their sum will be greater than 25 + 8 (whole number parts) and
will be less than 25 + 1 + 8 + 1.
What do you think about this claim? Verify if this is true for these
numbers. Will it work for any 2 decimal numbers?

Math
Talk

What about for the sum of 25.93603259 and 8.202?

numbers within which the difference of two decimal numbers

3.8 More on the Decimal System
Decimal and Measurement Disasters
Decimal point and unit conversion mistakes may seem minor sometimes
but they can lead to serious problems. Here are some actual incidents
in which such errors caused major issues.

A Peek Beyond the Point

• In 2013, the finance office of Amsterdam City Council (Netherlands)
mistakenly sent out €188 million in housing benefits instead of the
intended €1.8 million due to a programming error that processed
payments in euro cents instead of euros. (1 euro-cent = 1/100
euro).
• In 1983, a decimal error nearly caused a disaster for an Air Canada
Boeing 767. The ground staff miscalculated the fuel, loading 22,300
pounds instead of kilograms—about half of what was needed (1
pound ~ 0.453 kg). The plane ran out of fuel mid-air, forcing the
pilots to make an emergency landing at an abandoned airfield.
Fortunately, everyone survived.
Several incidents have occurred due to incorrect reading of decimal
numbers while giving medication. For example, reading 0.05 mg as 0.5
mg can lead to using a medicine 10 times more than the prescribed
quantity. It is therefore important to pay attention to units and the
location of the decimal point.

Deceptive Decimal Notation
Sarayu gets a message: “The bus will reach the station 4.5 hours post
noon.” When will the bus reach the station: 4:05 p.m., 4:50 p.m., 4:25 p.m.?
None of these! Here, 0.5 hours means splitting an hour into 10
equal parts and taking 5 parts out of it. Each part will be 6 minutes (60
minutes/10) long. 5 such parts make 30 minutes. So, the bus will reach
the station at 4:30.
Here is a short-story of a decimal mishap: A girl measures the width
of an opening as 2 ft 5 inches but conveys to the carpenter to make a
door 2.5 ft wide. The carpenter makes a door of width 2 ft 6 inches
(since 1 ft = 12 inches, 0.5 ft = 6 inches), and it wouldn’t close fully.

I said the door’s
width should be
2.5 ft.

It is 2.5 ft! You
can verify.

10 100
1
, and so on) are used in the works of a number of ancient Indian
1000
astronomers and mathematicians, including in the important 8th
century works of Śhrīdharāchārya on arithmetic and algebra. Decimal
notation, in essentially its modern form, was described in detail in
Kitāb al-Fuṣūl fī al-Ḥisāb al Hindī (The Book of Chapters on Indian
Arithmetic) by Abūl Ḥassan al-Uqlīdisī, an Arab mathematician, in
around 950 CE. He represented the number 0.059375 as 0 059375.
In the 15th century, to separate whole numbers from fractional
parts, a number of different notations were used:

ˈ

• a vertical mark on the last digit of the whole number part (as
shown above),
• use of different colours and
• a numerical superscript giving the number of fractional decimal
2

places (0.36 would be written as 36).
In the 16th century, John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, and
Christopher Clavius, a German mathematician, used the point/period
(‘.’) to separate the whole number and the fractional parts, while
François Viète, a French mathematician, used the comma (‘,’) instead.
Currently, several countries use the comma to separate the integer
part and the fractional part. In these countries, the number 1,000.5
is written as 1 000,5 (space as a thousand separator). But the decimal
point has endured as the most popular notation for writing numbers
having fractional parts in the Indian place value system.

SUMMARY
•
•

•
•

We can split a unit into smaller parts to get more exact/accurate
measurements.
We extended the Indian place value system and saw that
» 1 unit = 10 one-tenths,
» 1 tenth = 10 one-hundredths,
» 1 hundredth = 10 one-thousandths,
» 10 one-hundredths = 1 tenth,
» 100 one-hundredths = 1 unit.
A decimal point (‘.’) is used in the Indian place value system to separate
the whole number part of a number from its fractional part.
We also learnt how to compare decimal numbers, locate them on the
number line, and perform addition and subtraction on them.

EXPRESSIONS
USING LETTERNUMBERS

4.1 The Notion of Letter-Numbers
In this chapter we shall look at a concise way of expressing mathematical
relations and patterns. We shall see how this helps us in thinking about
these relationships and patterns, and in explaining why they may hold
true.
Example 1: Shabnam is 3 years older than Aftab. When Aftab’s age
10 years, Shabnam’s age will be 13 years. Now Aftab’s age is 18 years,
what will Shabnam’s age be? _______
Given Aftab’s age, how will you find out Shabnam’s age?
Easy: We add 3 to Aftab’s age to get Shabnam’s age.
Can we write this as an expression?
Shabnam’s age is 3 years more than Aftab’s. In short, this can be
written as:
Shabnam’s age = Aftab’s age + 3.
Such mathematical relations are Aftab’s

form. In the relation above, instead
4
4 + 3
of writing the phrase ‘Aftab’s Age’,
10
10 + 3
the convention is to use a convenient
symbol. Usually, letters or short phrases
23
23 + 3
are used for this purpose.
?
? + 3
Let us say we use the letter a to
a
a + 3
denote Aftab’s age (we could have
used any other letter), and s to denote
Fig. 4.1
Shabnam’s age. Then the expression to
find Shabnam’s age will be a + 3, which can be written as
s = a + 3.
If a is 23 (Aftab’s age in years), then what is Shabnam’s age?

Chapter-4.indd 81

4/11/2025 7:30:05 PM

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Replacing a by 23 in the expression a + 3, we get, s = 23 + 3 = 26 years.
Letters such as a and s that are used to represent numbers are called
letter-numbers. Mathematical expressions containing letter-numbers,
such as the expression a + 3, are called algebraic expressions.
Given the age of Shabnam, write an expression to find Aftab’s age.
We know that Aftab is 3 years younger than Shabnam. So, Aftab’s
age will be 3 less than Shabnam’s. This can be described as
		

Aftab’s age = Shabnam’s age – 3.

If we again use the letter a to denote Aftab’s age and the letter s
to denote Shabnam’s age, then the algebraic expression would be:
a = s – 3, meaning 3 less than s.
Use this expression to find Aftab’s age if Shabnam’s age is 20.
Example 2: Parthiv is making matchstick patterns. He repeatedly
places Ls next to each other. Each L has two matchsticks as shown in
Figure 4.2.

Fig. 4.2

How many matchsticks are needed to make 5 Ls? It will be 5 × 2.
How many matchsticks are needed to make 7 Ls? It will be 7 × 2.
How many matchsticks are needed to make 45 Ls? It will be 45 × 2.
 Now, what is the relation between the number of Ls and the number
of sticks?
First, let us describe the relationship or the pattern here. Every L
needs 2 matchsticks. So the number of matchsticks needed will be 2
times the number of L’s. This can be written as:
Number of matchsticks = 2 × Number of L’s
Now, we can use any letter to denote the number of L’s. Let’s use n.
The algebraic expression for the number of matchsticks will be:
2 × n.
This expression tells us how many matchsticks are needed to make
n L’s. To find the number of matchsticks, we just replace n by the
number of L.
Example 3: Ketaki prepares and supplies coconut-jaggery laddus. The
price of a coconut is ₹35 and the price of 1 kg jaggery is ₹60.

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers

How much should she pay if she buys 10 coconuts and 5 kg jaggery?
Cost of 10 coconuts = 10 × ₹35
Cost of 5 kg jaggery = 5 × ₹60
Total cost = 10 × ₹35 + 5 × ₹60 = ₹350 + ₹300 = ₹650.
How much should she pay if she buys 8 coconuts and 9 kg jaggery?
Write an algebraic expression to find the total amount to be paid for a
given number of coconuts and quantity of jaggery.
Let us identify the relationships and then write the expressions.
Quantity needed

Relationship

Expression

Cost of coconuts

Number of
coconuts × 35

c × 35

Cost of jaggery

Number of kgs of
jaggery × 60

j × 60

Here, ‘c’ represents the number of coconuts and ‘j’ represents the
number of kgs of jaggery. The total amount to be paid will be:
Cost of coconuts + Cost of jaggery.
The corresponding algebraic expression can be written as:
c × 35 + j × 60
Use this expression (or formula) to find the total amount to be paid for
7 coconuts and 4 kg jaggery.
Notice that for different values of ‘c’ and ‘j’, the value of the expression
also changes.
Writing this expression as a sum of terms we get:
c × 35

+

j × 60

Example 4: We are familiar with calculating the perimeters of simple
shapes. Write expressions for perimeters.
The perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of its side. This can
be written as the expression: 4 × q, where q stands for the sidelength.
What is the perimeter of a square with sidelength 7 cm? Use the
expression to find out.
You must have realised how the use of letter-numbers and algebraic
expressions allows us to express general mathematical relations in

4.2 Revisiting Arithmetic Expressions
We learnt to write expressions as sums of terms and it became easy
for us to read arithmetic expressions. Many times they could have
been read in multiple ways and it was confusing. We used swapping
(adding two numbers in any order) and grouping (adding numbers
by grouping them conveniently) to find easy ways of evaluating
expressions. Swapping and grouping terms does not change the value of
the expression. We also learnt to use brackets in expressions, including
brackets with a negative sign outside. We learnt the distributive
property (multiple of a sum is the same as sum of multiples).
Let us revise these concepts and find the values of the following
expressions:
1.

23 – 10 × 2

2.

83 + 28 – 13 + 32

3.

34 – 14 + 20

4.

42 + 15 – (8 – 7)

5.

68 – (18 + 13)

6.

7×4+9×6

7.

20 + 8 × (16 – 6)

Let us evaluate the first expression, 23 – 10 × 2. First we shall write
the terms of the expression. Notice that one of the terms is a number,
while the other one has to be converted to a number before adding the
two terms.
23 – 10 × 2 = 23 + –10 × 2 = 23 + –20 = 3

85

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Let us now evaluate the second one. All the terms of this expression
are numbers. If we notice the terms, we find that it will be easier to
evaluate if we swap and group the terms.
83 + 28 – 13 + 32 =

Let us now look at the fifth expression. It has brackets with a negative
sign outside. This can be evaluated in two ways — by solving the bracket
first (like the solution on the left side) or by removing the brackets
appropriately (as on the right side).

Now, find the values of the other arithmetic expressions.
Algebraic expressions also take number values when the letternumbers they contain are replaced by numbers. In Example 1, for
finding Shabnam’s age when Aftab is 23 years old, we replaced the
letter-number a in the expression a + 3 by 23, and it took the value 26.

4.3  
Omission of the Multiplication Symbol in
Algebraic Expressions
Look at this number sequence:
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, ...
How can we describe this sequence or pattern? Easy: These are the
numbers appearing in the multiplication table of 4 (multiples of 4 in
an increasing order).
What is the third term of this sequence? It is 4 × 3.
What is the 29th term of this sequence? It is 4 × 29.
Find an algebraic expression to get the nth term of this sequence.
Note that here ‘n’ is a letter-number that denotes a position in the
sequence.
86

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers

As it is the sequence of multiples of 4, it can be seen that the nth term
will be 4 times n:
4×n
As a standard practice, we shorten 4 × n to 4n by skipping the
multiplication sign. We write the number first, followed by the letter(s).
Find the value of the expression 7k when k = 4. The value is 7 × 4 = 28.
Find the value that the expression 5m + 3 takes when m = 2.
As 5m stands for 5 × m, the value of the expression when m = 2 is
5 × 2 + 3 = 13.

Mind the Mistake, Mend the Mistake
Some simplifications are shown below where the letter-numbers are
replaced by numbers and the value of the expression is obtained.
1. Observe each of them and identify if there is a mistake.
2. If you think there is a mistake, try to explain what might have gone
wrong.
3. Then, correct it and give the value of the expression.

then 2t + b = 24.

4.4 Simplification of Algebraic Expressions
Earlier we found expressions to find perimeters of different regular
figures in terms of their sides. Let us now find an expression to find the
perimeter of a rectangle.

87

Chapter-4.indd 87

4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

As in the previous cases, we will first describe how to get the perimeter
when the length and the breadth of the rectangle are known:
Find the sum of length + breadth + length + breadth.
Let us use the letter-numbers l and b in place of length and breadth
respectively. Let p denote the perimeter of the rectangle. Then we have
p=l+b+l+b
As we know, these represent numbers, and so the terms of an
expression can be added in any order. Hence the above expression can
be written as:
=l+l+b+b
As l + l = 2 × l = 2l, and b + b = 2 × b = 2b, we have
p = 2l + 2b.
Notice that the initial expression (l + b + l + b) and the final expression
(2l + 2b) that we got for the perimeter look different. However, they
are equal since the expression was obtained from the initial one by
applying the same rules and operations we do for numbers; they are
equal in the sense that they both take the same values when letternumbers are replaced by numbers.
For example, if we assign l = 3, b = 4, we get
l + b + l + b = 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 14, and
2l + 2b = 2 × 3 + 2 × 4 = 14.
We call the expression 2l + 2b the simplified form of l + b + l + b.
Let us see some more examples of simplification.
Example 5: Here is a table showing the number of pencils and erasers
sold in a shop. The price per pencil is c, and the price per eraser is d. Find
the total money earned by the shopkeeper during these three days.

Let us first find the money earned by the sale of pencils.
The money earned by selling pencils on Day 1 is 5c. Similarly, the
money earned by selling pencils on Day 2 is _____, and Day 3 is ______.
The total money earned by the sale of pencils is 5c + 3c + 10c. Can we
simplify this expression further and reduce the number of terms?
88

Chapter-4.indd 88

4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers

The expression means 5 times c is added to 3 times c is added to 10
times c. So in total, the letter-number c is added (5 + 3 + 10) times. This
is what we have seen as the distributive property of numbers. Thus,
5 × c + 3 × c + 10 × c = (5 + 3 + 10) × c
(5 + 3 + 10) × c can be simplified to 18 × c = 18c.
If c = ₹50, find the total amount earned by the scale of pencils.
Write the expression for the total money earned by selling erasers.
Then, simplify the expression.
The expression for the total money earned by selling pencils and
erasers during these three days is 18c + 11d.
Can the expression 18c + 11d be simplified further?
There is no way of further simplifying this expression as it contains
different letter-numbers. It is in its simplest form.
In this problem, we saw the expression 5c + 3c + 10c getting simplified
to the expression 18c.
Check that both expressions take the same value when c is replaced by
different numbers.
Example 6: A big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as
shown. Write an expression describing the area of the bigger rectangle.

Another way of seeing
the distributive
property.

v

The areas of the smaller rectangles are 4v sq. units and 3v sq. units.
The area of the bigger rectangle can be found in two ways: (i) by
directly using its side lengths v and (4 + 3), or (ii) by adding the areas
of the smaller rectangles.
The first way gives 7v, and the second way gives 4v + 3v. We know
that they are equal: 4v + 3v = 7v, and this is the required expression for
the area of the bigger rectangle.
As earlier, a big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as shown
below. Write an expression to find the area of the rectangle AEFD.
89

Chapter-4.indd 89

4/11/2025 7:30:06 PM

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Even in this case, the area of rectangle AEFD can be found in two
ways: (i) by directly using the side lengths n and (12 – 4), or (ii)
subtracting the area of the rectangle EBCF from that of ABCD.

B

The first method gives us 8n, and the second method gives us
12n – 4n, and they are equal, since 12n – 4n = 8n. This is the expression
for the area of the rectangle AEFD.
Sets of terms such as (5c, c, 10c), (12n, – 4n) that involve the same
letter-numbers are called like terms. Sets of terms such as {18c, 11d}
are called unlike terms as they have different letter-numbers.
As we have seen, like terms can be added together and simplified
into a single term.

and tables for a day’s use. To rent
them, one has to first pay the following

For x chairs and y tables, let us find the total amount paid at the
beginning and the amount one gets back after returning the furniture.
Describe the procedure to get these amounts.
The total amount in rupees paid at the beginning is 40x + 75y, and
the total amount returned is 6x + 10y.
So, the total amount paid = (40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y).

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers

Recalling how we open brackets in an arithmetic expression, we get
(40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y) = (40x + 75y) – 6x – 10y
Since the terms can be added in any order, the remaining bracket
can be opened and the expression becomes 40x + 75y + – 6x + – 10y
We can group the like terms together, This results in
40x + – 6x + 75y + – 10y
= (40 – 6)x + (75 – 10)y
= 34x + 65y.
The expression (40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y) is simplified to 34x + 65y,
which is the total amount paid in rupees.
Could we have written the initial expression as
(40x + 75y) + (– 6x – 10y)?

Example 8: Charu has been through three rounds of a quiz. Her scores
in the three rounds are 7p – 3q, 8p – 4q, and 6p – 2q. Here, p represents
the score for a correct answer and q represents the penalty for an
incorrect answer.
What do each of the expressions mean?
If the score for a correct answer is 4 (p = 4) and the penalty for a wrong
answer is 1 (q = 1), find Charu’s score in the first round.
Charu’s score is 7 × 4 – 3 × 1. We can evaluate this expression by
writing it as a sum of terms.
7 × 4 – 3 × 1 = 7 × 4 + – 3 × 1 = 28 + – 3 = 25
What are her scores in the second and third rounds?
What if there is no penalty? What will be the value of q in that
situation?
What is her final score after the three rounds?
 Her final score will be the sum of the three scores:
(7p – 3q) + (8p – 4q) + (6p – 2q).
Since the terms can be added in any order, we can remove the
brackets and write
7p + – 3q + 8p + – 4q + 6p + –2q
= 7p + 8p + 6p + – (3q) + – (4q) + – (2q) (by swapping and grouping)
= (7 + 8 + 6)p + – (3 + 4 + 2)q
= 21p + – 9q
= 21p – 9q.
Charu’s total score after three rounds is 21p – 9q. Her friend Krishita’s
score after three rounds is 23p – 7q.

Give some possible scores for Krishita in the three rounds so that they
add up to give 23p – 7q.
Can we say who scored more? Can you explain why?
How much more has Krishita scored than Charu? This can be found by
finding the difference between the two scores.
23p – 7q – (21p – 9q)
Simplify this expression further.
Example 9: Simplify the expression 4 (x + y) – y
Using the distributive property, this expression can be simplified to
4 (x + y) – y = 4x + 4y – y
= 4x + 4y + – y
= 4x + (4 – 1)y
= 4x + 3y.
Example 10: Are the expressions 5u and 5 + u equal to each other?
The expression 5u means 5 times the number u, and the expression
5 + u means 5 more than the number u. These two being different
operations, they should give different values for most values of u.
Let us check this.
Fill the blanks below by replacing the letter-numbers by numbers; an
example is shown. Then compare the values that 5u and 5 + u take.

So, these two expressions are not equal.

Adding the upper half and doubling gives:

4.5 Pick Patterns and Reveal Relationships
In the first section we got a glimpse of algebraic expressions and
how to use them to describe simple patterns and relationships in a
concise and elegant manner. Here, we continue to look for general
relationships between quantities in different scenarios, find patterns
and, interestingly, even explain why these patterns occur.
Remember the importance of describing in simple language, or
visualising mathematical relationships, before trying to write them as
expressions.

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers

Let us start with design C. It appears for the first time at position 3,
the second time at position 6.
Where would design C appear for the nth time?
We can see that this design appears in positions that are multiples of
3. So the nth occurrence of Design C will be at position 3n.
Similarly, find the formula that gives the position where the other
Designs appear for the nth time.
The positions where B occurs are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and so on.
We can see that the position of the nth appearance of Design B is one
less than the position at which Design C appears for the nth time. Thus,
the nth occurrence of Design B is at position:
3n – 1
Similarly, the expression describing the position at which the design
A appears for the nth time is: 3n – 2.
Given a position number can we find out the design that appears there?
Which Design appears at Position 122?
If the position is a multiple of 3, then clearly we have Design C. As
seen earlier, if the position is one less than a multiple of 3, it has Design
B, and if it is 2 less than a multiple of 3, then it has Design A.
Can the remainder obtained by dividing the position number by 3 be
used for this? Observe the table below.

Patterns in a Calendar
Here is the calendar of November 2024. Consider 2 × 2 squares,
as marked in the calendar. The numbers in this square show an
interesting property.

12 and 20; 13 and 19. Find their sums; 12 + 20,

They are equal.
Let us extend the numbers in the calendar beyond
30, creating endless rows.

Will the diagonal sums be equal in every 2 × 2 square in this endless
grid? How can we be sure?
To be sure of this we cannot check with all 2 × 2 squares as there are
an unlimited number of them.
Let us consider a 2 × 2 square. Its top left number can be any number.
Let us call it ‘a’.
Given that we know the top left number, how do we
find the other numbers in this 2 × 2 square?
As we have been doing, first let us describe the other
numbers in words.

• the number to the right of ‘a’ will be 1 more than it.
• the number below ‘a’ will be 7 more than it.
• the number diagonal to ‘a’ will be 8 more than it.
So the other numbers in the 2 × 2 square can be
a
a+1
represented as shown in the grid. Let us find the
diagonal sums; a + (a + 8), and (a + 1) + (a + 7).
a+7 a+8
Let us simplify them.
Since the terms can be added in any order, the
brackets can be opened.
a + (a + 8) = a + a + 8 = 2a + 8
(a + 1) + (a + 7) = a + 1 + a + 7 = a + a + 1 + 7 = 2a + 8
We see that both diagonal sums are equal to 2a + 8 (8 more than
2 times a).
Verify this expression for diagonal sums by considering any 2 × 2
square and taking its top left number to be ‘a’.
Thus, we have shown that diagonal sums are equal for any value of
a, i.e., for any 2 × 2 square!
This problem is an example that shows the power of algebraic modelling
in verifying whether a pattern will always hold.

What could be an expression describing the rule/formula to find out
the number of matchsticks at any step?
The pattern is such that in Step 10, nine 2s and an added 3 (3 + 2 ×
9) gives the number of matchsticks; in Step 11, ten 2s and an added
3 (3 + 2 × 10) gives the number of matchsticks. For step y, what is
the expression?
It is: one less than y (i.e. y – 1) 2s and a 3.
Therefore, the expression is
3 + 2 × (y – 1).
This expression gives the number of matchsticks in Step y. Now we
can find the number of matchsticks at any step quickly.
You might have already noticed that there is a 2 in the first step also,
3 = 1 + 2. Using this, the expression we get is
2y + 1.
Does the above expression also give the number of matchsticks at each
step correctly? Are these expressions the same?
We can check by simplifying the expression 3 + 2 × (y – 1).
3 + 2 × (y – 1) = 3 + 2y – 2
= 2y + 1.
Both expressions are the same.
There is a different way to count, or see the pattern. Let us take a
look at the picture again.

Matchsticks are placed in two orientations — (a) horizontal ones at
the top and bottom, and (b) the ones placed diagonally in the middle.
For example, in step 2 there are 2 matchsticks placed horizontally and
3 matchsticks placed diagonally.
What are these numbers in Step 3 and Step 4?
How does the number of matchsticks change in each orientation as the
steps increase? Write an expression for the number of matchsticks at
Step ‘y’ in each orientation. Do the two expressions add up to 2y + 1?

SUMMARY
•

•

•

Algebraic expressions are used in formulas to model patterns
and mathematical relationships between quantities, and to make
predictions.
Algebraic expressions use not only numbers but also letter-numbers.
The rules for manipulating arithmetic expressions also apply to
algebraic expressions. These rules can be used to reduce algebraic
expressions to their simplest forms.
Algebraic expressions can be described in ordinary language, and
vice versa. Patterns or relationships that are easily written using
algebra can often be long and complex in ordinary language. This is
one of the advantages of algebra.

PARALLEL AND
INTERSECTING
LINES

5.1 Across the Line
Take a piece of square paper and fold it in different ways. Now, on
the creases formed by the folds, draw lines using a pencil and a scale.
You will notice different lines on the paper. Take any pair of lines and
observe their relationship with each other. Do they meet? If they do
not meet within the paper, do you think they would meet if they were
extended beyond the paper?

Fig. 5.1

In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between lines on a
plane surface. The table top, your piece of paper, the blackboard, and
the bulletin board are all examples of plane surfaces.
Let us observe a pair of lines that meet each other. You will notice
that they meet at a point. When a pair of lines meet each other at a
point on a plane surface, we say that the lines intersect each other.
Let us observe what happens when two lines intersect.
How many angles do they form?
In Fig. 5.2, where line l intersects line m, we can see that four angles
are formed.

Can two straight lines intersect at more than one point?
Activity 1
Draw two lines on a plain sheet of paper so that they intersect. Measure
the four angles formed with a protractor. Draw four such pairs of
intersecting lines and measure the angles formed at the points of
intersection.
What patterns do you observe among these angles?
In Fig. 5.2, if ∠a is 120°, can you figure out the measurements of ∠b, ∠c
and ∠d, without drawing and measuring them?
We know that ∠a and ∠b together measure 180°, because when they
are combined, they form a straight angle which measures 180°. So, if
∠a is 120°, then ∠b must be 60°.
Similarly, ∠b and ∠c together measure 180°. So, if ∠b is 60°, then ∠c
must be 120°. And ∠c and ∠d together measure 180°. So, if ∠c is 120°,
then ∠d must be 60°.
Therefore, in Fig. 5.2, ∠a and ∠c measure 120°, and ∠b and ∠d
measure 60°.
When two lines intersect each other and form four angles, labelled
a, b, c and d, as in Fig. 5.2, then ∠a and ∠c are equal, and ∠b and ∠d
are equal!
Is this always true for any pair of intersecting lines?
Check this for different measures of ∠a. Using these measurements,
can you reason whether this property holds true for any measure of ∠a?
We can generalise our reasoning for Fig. 5.2, without assuming the
values of ∠a.
 Since straight angles measure 180°, we must have ∠a + ∠b = ∠a + ∠d
= 180°. Hence, ∠b and ∠d are always equal. Similarly, ∠b + ∠a = ∠b +
∠c = 180°, so ∠a and ∠c must be equal.
Adjacent angles, like ∠a and ∠b, formed by two lines intersecting
each other, are called linear pairs. Linear pairs always add up to 180°.

Opposite angles, like ∠b and ∠d, formed by two lines intersecting
each other, are called vertically opposite angles. Vertically opposite
angles are always equal to each other.
From the above reasoning, we conclude that whenever two lines
intersect, vertically opposite angles are equal. Such a justification is
called a proof in mathematics.

You might have noticed that when you measure linear pairs, sometimes
they may not add up to 180°. Or, when you measure vertically opposite
angles they may be unequal sometimes. What are the reasons for this?
There could be different reasons:
• Measurement errors because of improper use of measuring
instruments — in this case, a protractor
• Variation in the thickness of the lines drawn. The “ideal” line in
geometry does not have any thickness! But it is not possible for us
to draw lines without any thickness
In geometry, we create ideal versions of “lines” and other shapes
we see around us, and analyse the relationships between them. For
example, we know that the angle formed by a straight line is 180°.
So, if another line divides this angle into two parts, both parts should
add up to 180°. We arrive at this simply through reasoning and not
by measurement. When we measure, it might not be exactly so, for
the reasons mentioned above. Still the measurements come out very
close to what we predict, because of which geometry finds widespread
application in different disciplines such as physics, art, engineering
and architecture.

5.2 Perpendicular Lines
Can you draw a pair of intersecting lines such that all four angles are
equal? Can you figure out what will be the measure of each angle?

If two lines intersect and all four angles are equal, then each angle
must be a right angle (90°).
Perpendicular lines are a pair of lines which intersect each other
at right angles (90°). In Fig. 5.4, we can say that lines l and m are
perpendicular to each other.

5.3 Between Lines
Observe Fig. 5.5 and describe the way the line segments meet or cross
each other in each case, with appropriate mathematical words (a point,
an endpoint, the midpoint, meet, intersect) and the degree measure of
each angle.
For example, line segments FG and FH meet at the endpoint F at an
angle 115.3°.

What is common to the lines in the pictures above? They do not seem
likely to intersect each other. Such lines are called parallel lines.
Parallel lines are a pair of lines that lie on the same plane, and do
not meet however far we extend them at both ends.
Name some parallel lines you can spot in your classroom.

Parallel lines are often used in artwork and shading.

Note to the Teacher: It is easier to draw vertical and horizontal lines and the
ones inclined at 45° (on rectangular dot sheets), but drawing a line parallel to
one which has a different orientation is slightly harder. Let students use their
intuition for this.

From previous exercises we observed that sometimes it is difficult
to be sure whether two lines are parallel. To determine this we use the
idea of transversals.

We saw what happens when two lines intersect in different ways. Let
us explore what happens when one line intersects two different lines.

l

5 6

m

8 7
t
Fig. 5.14

In Fig. 5.14, line t intersects lines l and m. t is called a transversal.
Notice that 8 angles are formed when a line crosses a pair of lines.
Is it possible for all the eight angles to have different measurements?
Why, why not?
What about five different angles — 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2?
In Fig. 5.14, since ∠1 and ∠3 are vertically opposite angles, they are
equal. Are there other pairs of vertically opposite angles? We can see
that there are a total of four pairs of vertically opposite angles and in
each pair, the angles are equal to each other.
Thus, when a transversal intersects two lines, it forms eight angles
with a maximum of four distinct angle measures.

5.6 Corresponding Angles
In Fig. 5.14, we notice that the transversal t forms two sets of angles —
one with line l and another with line m. There are angles in the first set
that correspond to angles in the second set based on their position. ∠1
and ∠5 are called corresponding angles. Similarly, ∠2 and ∠6, ∠3 and
∠7, ∠4 and ∠8 are the corresponding angles formed when transversal
t intersects lines l and m.
Activity 3
Draw a pair of lines and a transversal such that they form two
distinct angles.

Step 1: Draw a line l and a transversal t intersecting it at point X.

How many distinct angles have formed now?
If one angle is 60°, the other angle of the linear pair should be 120°.
So, we already have two distinct angles.
So, when we draw another line intersecting the transversal t we
wish to form only two angles, 60° and 120°.
Step 3: Mark a point Y on line t.

t on lines l and m. These corresponding angles are equal to each other.

Parallel and Intersecting Lines

From this we can observe:
When the corresponding angles formed by a transversal on a pair
of lines are equal to each other, then the pair of lines are parallel
to each other.
Suppose, we have a transversal intersecting two parallel lines. What
can be said about the corresponding angles?
Activity 4
Fig. 5.19 has a pair of parallel lines l and m (what is the notation used
in the figure to indicate they are parallel?) . Line t is the transversal
across these two lines. ∠a and ∠b are corresponding angles. Take a
tracing paper and trace ∠a on it. Now place this tracing paper over
∠b and see if the angles align exactly. You will observe that the angles
match. Check the other corresponding angles in the figure using a
protractor. Are all the corresponding angles equal to each other?

of corresponding angles is equal. You can measure the angles with a
protractor.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

When a pair of lines are not parallel to each other, the corresponding
angles formed by a transversal can never be equal to each other.

5.7 Drawing Parallel Lines
Can you draw a pair of parallel lines using a ruler and a set square?
Fig. 5.21 shows how you can do it.
Draw a line l with a scale. By sliding your set square you can make
two lines perpendicular to line l.
Are these two lines parallel to each other? How are we sure that they
are parallel to each other? What angles are formed between these lines
and line l?
l

Fig. 5.21

Since we used a set square, the angles measure 90°. The position
of the lines is different, but they make the same angle with l. If line l
is seen as a transversal to the two new lines, then the corresponding
angles measure 90°.

l
Fig. 5.22

As we know these are corresponding angles and they are equal, we
can be sure that the lines are parallel.
Draw two more parallel lines using the long side of the set square as
shown in Fig. 5.22.

Parallel and Intersecting Lines

How do you know these two lines are parallel? Can you check if the
corresponding angles are equal?
Note to the Teacher: Students should be encouraged to check the equality of
corresponding angles both by using the tracing method and using protractors to
measure the angles. Pay attention to the language used to make the relationship
between corresponding angles and parallel lines. Equality of corresponding
angles is both necessary and sufficient for the pair of lines to be parallel to
each other.

you do it with the tools from your geometry box? Describe your method.

Making Parallel Lines through Paper Folding
Let us try to do the same with paper folding. For a line l (given as a
crease), how do we make a line parallel to l such that it passes through
point A?
We know how to fold a piece of paper to get a line perpendicular to l.
Now, try to fold a perpendicular to l such that it passes through point
A. Let us call this new crease t.
Now, fold a line perpendicular to t passing through A again. Let us
call this line m. The lines l and m are parallel to each other.

5.8 Alternate Angles

angle of ∠e.

Fig. 5.25

You can find the alternate angle of a given angle, say ∠f, by first
finding the corresponding angle of ∠f, which is ∠b and then finding the
vertically opposite angle of ∠b, which is ∠d.
Activity 6
In Fig. 5.25, if ∠f is 120° what is the measure of its alternate angle ∠d?
We can find the measure of ∠d if we know ∠b because they are
vertically opposite angles. Remember, vertically opposite angles are
equal.
What is the measure of ∠b? It is 120° because it is the corresponding
angle of ∠f.
So, ∠d also measures 120°.
In fact, ∠f = ∠b irrespective of the measure of ∠f. Why? Because ∠b
is the corresponding angle of ∠f.
Similarly, ∠b = ∠d irrespective of the measure of ∠b. Why? Because
∠d is the vertically opposite angle of ∠b. So, it must always be the
case that
∠f = ∠d
Using our understanding of corresponding angles without any
measurements, we have justified that alternate angles are always equal.
Alternate angles formed by a transversal intersecting a pair of
parallel lines are always equal to each other.
Example 1: In Fig. 5.26, parallel lines l and m are intersected by the
transversal t. If ∠6 is 135°, what are the measures of the other angles?

Fig. 5.26

Solution: ∠6 is 135°, so ∠2 is also 135°, because it is the corresponding
angle of ∠6 and the lines l and m are parallel.
∠8 is 135°, because it is the vertically opposite angle of ∠6. ∠4 is 135°
because it is the corresponding angle of ∠8.
∠2 is 135° because is the vertically opposite angle of ∠4. So, ∠2, ∠4,
∠6, and ∠8 are all 135°.
∠5 and ∠6 are a linear pair, together they measure 180°. If ∠6 is
135°, then
∠5 = 180 – 135 = 45°
We can similarly find out that ∠1, ∠3, and ∠7 measure 45°.
Example 2: In Fig. 5.27, lines l and m are intersected by the transversal
t. If ∠a is 120° and ∠f is 70°, are lines l and m parallel to each other?

m

Fig. 5.27

Solution: ∠a is 120°, so ∠b is 60° because ∠a and ∠b form a linear pair.
∠b is a corresponding angle of ∠f. If l and m are parallel, ∠b should be
equal to ∠f, however, they are not equal.
Therefore, lines l and m are not parallel to each other as the corresponding
angles formed by the transversal t are not equal to each other.
Example 3: In Fig. 5.28, parallel lines l and m are intersected by the
transversal t. If ∠3 is 50°, what is the measure of ∠6?

Solution: ∠3 is 50°; therefore, ∠2 is 130°, because ∠2 and ∠3 form a
linear pair, and linear pairs always add up to 180°.
∠2 and ∠6 are corresponding angles, and they need to be equal since
lines l and m are parallel.
So, ∠6 is 130°.
Angles ∠3 and ∠6 are called interior angles.
Is there a relation between ∠3 and ∠6? You could try to find the
relationship by taking different values for ∠3 and see what ∠6 is.
Once you find a relation, try to justify it or prove that this relation
holds always. You will find that the sum of the interior angles on
the same side of the transversal always add up to 180°.
Example 4: In Fig. 5.29, line segment AB is parallel to CD and AD is
parallel to BC. ∠DAC is 65° and ∠ADC is 60°. What are the measures of
angles ∠CAB, ∠ABC, and ∠BCD?
Solution: Let us observe the parallel lines AB and CD. AD is a
transversal of these two lines.
A

B

65°

60°
D

C
Fig. 5.29

We know that the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal
on a pair of parallel lines adds up to 180°. So
∠ADC + ∠DAB = 180°
60° + ∠DAB = 180°.
So ∠DAB = 120°.
Can we find ∠CAB from this?
∠DAB = ∠DAC + ∠CAB.
So 120° = 65° + ∠CAB.
So ∠CAB = 55°.
Let us observe the parallel line segments AD and BC. They are
intersected by a transversal CD. So, ∠ADC + ∠BCD = 180°, because they
are interior angles on the same side of the transversal. Since ∠ADC is
given as 60°, ∠BCD = 120°
Similarly, we find ∠ABC = 60°.
Therefore, in Fig. 5.29, ∠CAB = 55°, ∠ABC = 60°, and ∠BCD = 120°.

SUMMARY

•
•

•
•

When two lines intersect, they form four angles. The vertically
opposite angles are equal and the linear pairs add up to 180°.
When two lines intersect and the angles formed are 90° (i.e., all four
angles are equal), the lines are said to be perpendicular to each other.
When two lines never intersect on a plane, they are called parallel
lines.
When a line t intersects another pair of lines, it is called a transversal
and it forms 2 sets of 4 angles. Each of the 4 angles in the first set has
a corresponding angle in the second set.
When a transversal intersects a pair of parallel lines, the
corresponding angles are equal. When a transversal intersects a pair
of lines and the corresponding angles are equal, then the pair of lines
is parallel.
When a transversal intersects a pair of parallel lines, the alternate
angles are equal.
The interior angles on the same side formed by a transversal
intersecting a pair of parallel lines always add up to 180°.

6.2 Picking Parity
Kishor has some number cards and is working on a puzzle: There
are 5 boxes, and each box should contain exactly 1 number card. The
numbers in the boxes should sum to 30. Can you help him find a way
to do it?
+

= 30

Can you figure out which 5 cards add to 30? Is it possible?
There are many ways of choosing 5 cards from this collection.
 Is there a way to find a solution without checking all possibilities?
Let us find out.
Add a few even numbers together. What kind of number do you get?
Does it matter how many numbers are added?
Any even number can be arranged in pairs without any leftovers.
Some even numbers are shown here, arranged in pairs.

As we see in the figure, adding any number of even numbers
will result in a number which can still be arranged in pairs
without any leftovers. In other words, the sum will always be an
even number.
Now, add a few odd numbers together. What kind of number do you
get? Does it matter how many odd numbers are added?
Odd numbers can not be arranged in pairs. An odd number is one
more than a collection of pairs. Some odd numbers are shown below:

Can we also think of an odd number as one less than a collection
of pairs?
This figure shows that the sum of two odd numbers must always
be even! This along with the other figures here are more examples
of a proof!
We can see that
two odd numbers added
together can always be
arranged in pairs.

What about adding 3 odd numbers? Can the resulting sum be arranged
in pairs? No.
Explore what happens to the sum of (a) 4 odd numbers, (b) 5 odd
numbers, and (c) 6 odd numbers.
Let us go back to the puzzle Kishor was trying to solve. There are
5 empty boxes. That means he has an odd number of boxes. All the
number cards contain odd numbers.
They should add to 30, which is an even number. Since, adding any
5 odd numbers will never result in an even number, Kishor cannot
arrange these cards in the boxes to add up to 30.
Two siblings, Martin and Maria, were born exactly one year apart.
Today they are celebrating their birthday. Maria exclaims that the sum
of their ages is 112. Is this possible? Why or why not?
As they were born one year apart, their ages will be (two) consecutive
numbers. Can their ages be 51 and 52? 51 + 52 = 103. Try some other
consecutive numbers and see if their sum is 112.
The counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... alternate between even and odd
numbers. In any two consecutive numbers, one will always be even
and the other will always be odd!
What would be the resulting sum of an even number and an odd
number? We can see that their sum can’t be arranged in pairs and thus
will be an odd number.

Since 112 is an even number, and Martin’s and Maria’s ages are
consecutive numbers, they cannot add up to 112.
We use the word parity to denote the property of being even or odd.
For instance, the parity of the sum of any two consecutive numbers is
odd. Similarly, the parity of the sum of any two odd numbers is even.
Figure it Out
1. Using your understanding of the pictorial representation of odd
and even numbers, find out the parity of the following sums:
(a) Sum of 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers (e.g., even + even
+ odd + odd)
(b) Sum of 2 odd numbers and 3 even numbers
(c)

Sum of 5 even numbers

(d) Sum of 8 odd numbers
2. Lakpa has an odd number of ₹1 coins, an odd number of ₹5 coins
and an even number of ₹10 coins in his piggy bank. He calculated
the total and got ₹205. Did he make a mistake? If he did, explain
why. If he didn’t, how many coins of each type could he have?
3. We know that:
(a) even + even = even
(b) odd + odd
(c)

= even

even + odd = odd

Similarly, find out the parity for the scenarios below:
(d) even – even = ___________________
(e) odd – odd

= ___________________

(f)

even – odd

= ___________________

(g) odd – even

= ___________________

Small Squares in Grids
In a 3 × 3 grid, there are 9 small squares,
which is an odd number. Meanwhile, in
a 3 × 4 grid, there are 12 small squares,
which is an even number.
Given the dimensions of a grid, can you
tell the parity of the number of small
squares without calculating the product?

Come up with an expression that always has even parity.
Some examples are: 100p and 48w – 2. Try to find more.
Come up with expressions that always have odd parity.
Come up with other expressions, like 3n + 4, which could have either
odd or even parity.
The expression 6k + 2 evaluates to 8, 14, 20,... (for k = 1, 2, 3,...) — many
even numbers are missing.
Are there expressions using which we can list all the even numbers?
Hint: All even numbers have a factor 2.
Are there expressions using which we can list all odd numbers?
We saw earlier how to express the nth term of the sequence of
multiples of 4, where n is the letter-number that denotes a position in
the sequence (e.g., first, twenty third, hundred and seventeenth, etc.).
What would be the nth term for multiples of 2? Or, what is the nth even
number?
Let us consider odd numbers.
What is the 100th odd number?
To answer this question, consider the following question:
132

Chapter-6.indd 132

4/12/2025 11:59:05 AM

Number Play

What is the 100th even number?
This is 2 × 100 = 200.
Does this help in finding the 100th odd number? Let us compare the
sequence of evens and odds term-by-term.
Even Numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,...
Odd Numbers:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,...
We see that at any position, the value at the odd number sequence
is one less than that in the even number sequence. Thus, the 100th odd
number is 200 – 1 = 199.
Write a formula to find the nth odd number.
Let us first describe the method that we have learnt to find the odd
number at a given position:
(a) Find the even number at that position. This is 2 times the
position number.
(b) Then subtract 1 from the even number.
Writing this in expressions, we get
(a) 2n
(b) 2n – 1
Thus, 2n is the formula that gives the nth even number, and 2n – 1 is
the formula that gives the nth odd number.

6.3 Some Explorations in Grids
Observe this 3 × 3 grid. It is filled following a simple
rule — use numbers from 1 – 9 without repeating
any of them. There are circled numbers outside the
grid.

Make a couple of questions like this on your own and challenge your
peers.
Try solving the problem below.

5

You might have realised that it is not possible to
find a solution for this grid. Why is this the case?

6

The smallest sum possible is 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. The
largest sum possible is 24 = 9 + 8 + 7. Clearly, any
number in a circle cannot be less than 6 or
9
11
26
greater than 24. The grid has sums 5 and 26.
Therefore, this is impossible!
The 3 row sums
In the earlier grids which we solved,
added together gives
Kishor noticed that the sum of all the
45! So does adding
numbers in the circles was always 90. Also,
the column sums.
Vidya observed that the sum of the circled
numbers for all three rows, or for all three
columns, was always 45. Check if this is true
in the previous grids you have solved.

21
19

Why should the row sums and column sums
always add to 45?
From this grid, we can see that all the
row sums added together will be the same
as the sum of the numbers 1 – 9. This can be
seen for column sums as well. The sum of
the numbers 1 – 9 is
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45.

A square grid of numbers is called a
4+6+3 7+1+9 5+2+8
magic square if each row, each column and
each diagonal, add up to the same number.
This number is called the magic sum.
Diagonals are shown in the picture.
Trying to create a magic square by randomly filling
the grid with numbers may be difficult! This is because
there are a large number of ways of filling a 3 × 3 grid
using the numbers 1 – 9 without repetition. In fact, it
can be found that there are exactly 3,62,880 such ways.
Surprisingly, the number of ways to fill in the grid can be
found without listing all of them. We will see in later years how to do this.
Instead, we should proceed systematically to make a magic square.
For this, let us ask ourselves some questions.
1. What can the magic sum be? Can it be any number?
134

Chapter-6.indd 134

4/12/2025 11:59:05 AM

Number Play

Let us focus, for the moment, only on the row sums. We have seen that
in a 3 × 3 grid with numbers 1 – 9, the total of row sums will always be
45. Since in a magic square the row sums are all equal, and they add up
to 45, they have to be 15 each. Thus, we have the following observation.
Observation 1: In a magic square made using the numbers 1 – 9, the
magic sum must be 15.
2. What are the possible numbers that could occur at the centre of a
magic square?
Let us consider the possibilities one by one.
8
Can the central number be 9? If yes, then 8 must
come in one of the other squares. For example,
In this, we must have 8 + 9 + other number = 15.
9
But this is not possible! The same issue will
occur no matter where we place 8.
So, 9 cannot be at the centre. Can the central
number be 1?
If yes, then 2 should come in one of the other
squares.
Here, we must have 2 + 1 + other number = 15.
But this is not possible because we are only
1
using the numbers 1 – 9. The same issue will
occur no matter where we place 1.
So, 1 cannot be at the centre, either.
2
Using such reasoning, find out which other
numbers 1 – 9 cannot occur at the centre.
This exploration will lead us to the following
interesting observation.
Observation 2: The number occurring at
the centre of a magic square, filled using 1 – 9,
5
must be 5.
Let us now see where the smallest number 1
and the largest number 9 should come in a magic
square. Our second observation tells us that
they will have to come in one of the boundary
positions. Let us classify these positions into two categories:

135

Chapter-6.indd 135

4/12/2025 11:59:05 AM

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Can 1 occur in a corner position? For example,
can it be placed as follows?
If yes, then there should exist three ways of
adding 1 with two other numbers to give 15.
We have 1 + 5 + 9 = 1 + 6 + 8 = 15. Is any other
combination possible?

15

1

15

Similarly, can 9 can be placed in a corner position?
Observation 3: The numbers 1 and 9 cannot occur in any corner, so
they should occur in one of the middle positions.
Can you find the other possible positions for 1 and 9?

2. Create a magic square using the numbers 2 – 10. What strategy
would you use for this? Compare it with the magic squares
made using 1 – 9.
3. Take a magic square, and
(a) increase each number by 1
(b) double each number
I  n each case, is the resulting grid also a magic square? How do the
magic sums change in each case?
4. What other operations can be performed on a magic square to
yield another magic square?

5. Discuss ways of creating a magic square using any set of 9

We can describe how the numbers within the magic square are related
to each other, i.e., the structure of the magic square.

The first magic square ever recorded, the Lo Shu Square, dates
back over 2000 years to ancient China. The legend tells of a
catastrophic flood on the Lo River, during which the gods sent
a turtle to save the people. The turtle carried a 3 × 3
grid on its back, with the numbers 1 to 9 arranged in
a magical pattern.

Magic squares were studied in different parts of

Indian mathematicians have worked extensively on magic
squares, describing general methods of constructing them.
The work of Indian mathematicians was not just limited to 3 × 3 and
4 × 4 grids, which we considered above, but also extended to 5 × 5 and
other larger square grids. We shall learn more about these in
later grades.
The occurrence of magic squares is not limited to scholarly
mathematical works. They are found in many places in India.
The picture to the right is of a 3 × 3 magic square found on
a pillar in a temple in Palani, Tamil Nadu. The temple dates
back to the 8th century CE.
3 × 3 magic squares can also be found in homes and shops in
India. The Navagraha Yantra is one such example shown below.

6.4 Nature’s Favourite Sequence: The Virahāṅka–
Fibonacci Numbers!
The sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . (Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers)
is one of the most celebrated sequences in all of mathematics — it
occurs throughout the world of Art, Science, and Mathematics. Even
though these numbers are found very frequently in Science, it is
remarkable that these numbers were first discovered in the context of
Art (specifically, poetry)!
The Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers thus provide a beautiful
illustration of the close links between Art, Science, and Mathematics.

Discovery of the Virahāṅka Numbers
The Virahāṅka numbers first came up thousands of years ago in the
works of Sanskrit and Prakrit linguists in their study of poetry!
In the poetry of many Indian languages, including, Prakrit, Sanskrit,
Marathi, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu, each syllable is classified as
either long or short.
A long syllable is pronounced for a longer duration than a short
syllable — in fact, for exactly twice as long. When singing such a poem,
a short syllable lasts one beat of time, and a long syllable lasts two
beats of time.
This leads to numerous mathematical questions, which the ancient
poets in these languages considered extensively. A number of important
mathematical discoveries were made in the process of asking and
answering these questions about poetry.
One of these particularly important questions was the following.
How many rhythms are there with 8 beats consisting of short syllables
(1 beat) and long syllables (2 beats)? That is, in how many ways can one

139

Chapter-6.indd 139

4/12/2025 11:59:07 AM

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

fill 8 beats with short and long syllables, where a short syllable takes
one beat of time and a long syllable takes two beats of time.
Here are some possibilities:
long long long long
short short short short short short short short
short long long short long
long long short short long
.
.
.
Can you find others?
Phrased more mathematically: In how many different ways can one
write a number, say 8, as a sum of 1’s and 2’s?
For example, we have:
					
8 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2,
					
8 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1,
					
8 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2,
					
8 = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2,
					
etc.
Do you see other ways?
Here are all the ways of writing each of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4,
as the sum of 1’s and 2’s.
Different Ways

Try writing the number 5 as a sum of 1s and 2s in all possible ways
in your notebook! How many ways did you find? (You should find 8
different ways!) Can you figure out the answer without listing down all
the possibilities? Can you try it for n = 8?
Here is a systematic way to write down all rhythms of short and long
syllables having 5 beats. Write a ‘1+’ in front of all rhythms having 4
beats, and then a ‘2+’ in front of all rhythms having 3 beats. This gives
us all the rhythms having 5 beats:

1+1+1+2
1+1+2+1
1+2+1+1
1+2+2

2+1+1+1
2+1+2
2+2+1

Thus, there are 8 rhythms having 5 beats!
The reason this method works is that every 5-beat rhythm must begin
with either a ‘1+’ or a ‘2+’. If it begins with a ‘1+’, then the remaining
numbers must give a 4-beat rhythm, and we can write all those down.
If it begins with a 2+, then the remaining number must give a 3-beat
rhythm, and we can write all those down. Therefore, the number of
5-beat rhythms is the number of 4-beat rhythms, plus the number of
3-beat rhythms.
How many 6-beat rhythms are there? By the same reasoning, it will
be the number of 5-beat rhythms plus the number of 4-beat rhythms,
i.e., 8 + 5 = 13. Thus, there are 13 rhythms having 6 beats.
Use the systematic method to write down all 6-beat rhythms, i.e., write
6 as the sum of 1’s and 2’s in all possible ways. Did you get 13 ways?
This beautiful method for counting all the rhythms of short syllables
and long syllables having any given number of beats was first given by
the great Prakrit scholar Virahāṅka around the year 700 CE. He gave
his method in the form of a Prakrit poem! For this reason, the sequence
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . is known as the Virahāṅka sequence, and
the numbers in the sequence are known as the Virahāṅka numbers.
Virahāṅka was the first known person in history to explicitly consider
these important numbers and write down the rule for their formation.
Other scholars in India also considered these numbers in the
same poetic context. Virahāṅka was inspired by earlier work of the
legendary Sanskrit scholar Piṅgala, who lived around 300 BCE. After
Virahāṅka, these numbers were also written about by Gopala (c. 1135
CE) and then by Hemachandra (c. 1150 CE).
In the West, these numbers have been known as the Fibonacci
numbers, after the Italian mathematician who wrote about them in
the year 1202 CE — about 500 years after Virahāṅka. As we can see,
Fibonacci was not first, nor the second, not even the third person to
write about these numbers! Sometimes the term “Virahāṅka–Fibonacci
numbers” is used so that everyone understands what is being referred
to.
So, how many rhythms of short and long syllables are there having
8 beats? We simply take the 8th element of the Virahāṅka sequence:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 , 55, ...
Thus, there are 34 rhythms having 8 beats.
141

Chapter-6.indd 141

4/12/2025 11:59:07 AM

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Write the next number in the sequence, after 55.
We have seen that the next number in the sequence is given by
adding the two previous numbers. Check that this holds true for the
numbers given above. The next number is 34 + 55 = 89.
Write the next 3 numbers in the sequence:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 , 55, 89, ____, ____, ____, …
If you have to write one more number in the sequence above, can
you tell whether it will be an odd number or an even number (without
adding the two previous numbers)?
What is the parity of each number in the sequence? Do you notice any
pattern in the sequence of parities?
Today, the Virahāṅka–Fibonacci numbers form the basis of many
mathematical and artistic theories, from poetry to drumming, to
visual arts and architecture, to science. Perhaps the most stunning
occurrences of these numbers are in nature. For example, the number
of petals on a daisy is generally a Virahāṅka number.
How many petals do you see on each of these flowers?

A daisy with 13
petals

A daisy with 21
petals

A daisy with 34
petals

There are many other
remarkable
mathematical
properties of the Virahāṅka–
Fibonacci numbers that we
will see later, in mathematics
as well as in other subjects.
These
numbers
truly
exemplify the close connections
between Art, Science, and

SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have explored the following:
• In the first activity, we saw how to represent information about how
a sequence of numbers (e.g., height measures) is arranged without
knowing the actual numbers.
• We learnt the notion of parity — numbers that can be arranged in
pairs (even numbers) and numbers that cannot be arranged in pairs
(odd numbers).
• We learnt how to determine the parity of sums and products.
• While exploring sums in grids, we could determine whether filling
a grid is impossible by looking at the row and column sums. We
extended this to construct magic squares.
• We saw how Virahāṅka numbers were first discovered in history
through the Arts. The Virahāṅka sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,
55, ...
• We became math-detectives through cryptarithms, where digits are
replaced by letters.

A triangle is the most basic closed shape. As we know, it consists of:
• three corner points, that we call the vertex of the triangle, and
• three line segments or the sides of the triangle that join the pairs
of vertices.
Triangles come in various shapes. Some of them are shown below.

Observe the symbol used to denote a triangle and how the triangles
are named using their vertices. While naming a triangle, the vertices
can come in any order.
The three sides meeting at the corners give rise to three angles that
we call the angles of the triangle. For example, in ∆ABC, these angles
are ∠CAB, ∠ABC, ∠BCA, which we simply denote as ∠A, ∠B and ∠C,
respectively.
What happens when the three vertices lie on a straight line?

7.1 Equilateral Triangles
Among all the triangles, the equilateral triangles are the most symmetric
ones. These are triangles in which all the sides are of equal lengths. Let
us try constructing them.
Construct a triangle in which all the sides are of length 4 cm.

Chapter-7.indd 146


A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines

How did you construct this triangle and what tools did you use? Can
this construction be done only using a marked ruler (and a pencil)?
Constructing this triangle using just a ruler is certainly possible. But
this might require several trials. Say we draw the base — let us call it
AB — of length 4 cm (see the figure below), and mark the third point C
using a ruler such that AC = 4 cm. This may not lead to BC also having
a length of 4 cm. If this happens, we will have to keep making attempts
to mark C till we get BC to be 4 cm long.

How do we make this construction more efficient?
Recall solving a similar problem in the previous year using a compass
(in the Chapter ‘Playing with Constructions’). We had to mark the top
point of a ‘house’ which is 5 cm from two other points. The method we
used to get that point can also be used here.
After constructing AB = 4 cm, we can do the following.
Step 1: Using a compass, construct a sufficiently long arc of radius 4 cm
from A, as shown in the figure. The point C is somewhere on this arc.
How do we mark it?

Constructing a Triangle When its Sides are

just a marked ruler. But it will involve several trials.

How do we construct this triangle more efficiently?
Choose one of the given lengths to be the base of the triangle: say 4
cm. Draw the base. Let A and B be the base vertices, and call the third
vertex C. Let AC = 5 cm and BC = 6 cm.
Fig. 7.1

Like we did in the case of equilateral triangles, let us first get all the
points that are at a 5 cm distance from A. These points lie on the circle
whose centre is A and has radius 5 cm. The point C must lie somewhere
on this circle. How do we find it?

The required point C is one of the points of intersection of the two
circles.

The reason why the point of
intersection is the third vertex is the
same as for equilateral triangles. This
point lies on both the circles. Hence
its distance from A is the radius of
the circle centred at A (5 cm) and its

A
distance from B is the same as the
radius of the circle centred at B (6 cm).
Let us summarise the steps of
construction, noting that constructing
full circles is not necessary to get the
third vertex (see Fig. 7.2 and 7.3).
Step 1:  Construct the base AB with one of the side lengths. Let us choose
AB = 4 cm (see Fig. 7.1).
Step 2:  From A, construct a sufficiently long arc of radius 5 cm
(see Fig. 7.2).
Step 3:  From B, construct an arc of radius 6 cm such that it intersects
the first arc (see Fig. 7.3).
The point where both the arcs meet is the required third
Step 4:  
vertex C. Join AC and BC to get ∆ABC.

Construct triangles having the following sidelengths (all the units are

(e) 3.5, 3.5, 3.5
We have seen that triangles having all three equal sides are called
equilateral triangles. Those having two equal sides are called isosceles
triangles.

Are Triangles Possible for any Lengths?
Can one construct triangles having any given sidelengths? Are there
lengths for which it is impossible to construct a triangle? Let us explore
this.
Construct a triangle with sidelengths 3 cm, 4 cm, and 8 cm.
What is happening? Are you able to construct the triangle?
Here is another set of lengths: 2 cm, 3 cm, and 6 cm. Check if a triangle
is possible for these sidelengths.
Try to find more sets of lengths for which a triangle construction
is impossible. See if you can find any pattern in them.

Math
Talk

We see that a triangle is possible for some sets of lengths and
not possible for others. How do we check if a triangle exists for a given
set of lengths? One way is to actually try to construct the triangle and
check if it is possible. Is there a more efficient way to check this?
Triangle Inequality
Consider the lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm. Does there exist a triangle
having these as sidelengths?
To tackle this question, let us study a property of triangles. Imagine
a small plot of plain land having a tent, a tree, and a pole. Imagine
you are at the entrance of the tent and want to go to the tree. Which is
the shorter path: (i) the straight-line path to the tree (the red path) or
(ii) the straight-line path from the tent to the pole, followed by the
straight-line path from the pole to the tree (the yellow path)?

151

Chapter-7.indd 151

4/11/2025 7:31:55 PM

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Clearly, the direct straight-line path from the tent to the tree is shorter
than the roundabout path via the pole. In fact, the direct straight-line
path is the shortest possible path to the tree from the tent.

Will the direct path between any two points be shorter than the
roundabout path via a third point? Clearly, the answer is yes.
Can this understanding be used to tell something about the existence
of a triangle having sidelengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm?
Let us suppose that there is a triangle for this set of lengths. Remember
that at this point we are not sure about the existence of the triangle but
we are only supposing that it exists. Let us draw a rough diagram.

Fig. 7.4

152

Chapter-7.indd 152


A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines

Does everything look right with this triangle?
If this triangle were possible, then the direct path between any two
vertices should be shorter than the roundabout path via the third
vertex. Is this true for our rough diagram?
Let us consider the paths between B and C.
Direct path length = BC = 10 cm
What is the length of the roundabout path via the vertex A? It is the
sum of the lengths of line segments BA and AC.
Roundabout path length = BA + AC = 15 cm + 30 cm = 45 cm
 Is the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? Yes.
Let us now consider the paths between A and B.
Direct path length = AB = 15 cm
Finding the length of the roundabout path via the vertex C, we get
Roundabout path length = AC + CB = 30 cm + 10 cm = 40 cm
I  s the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? Yes.
Finally, consider paths between C and A.
Direct path length = CA = 30 cm
Roundabout path length = CB + BA = 10 cm + 15 cm = 25 cm
Is the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? In
this case, the direct path is longer, which is absurd. Can such a triangle
exist? No.
Therefore, a triangle having sidelengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm
cannot exist.
We are thus able to see without construction why a triangle for the
set of lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm cannot exist. We have been able
to figure this out through spatial intuition and reasoning.
Recall how we used similar intuition and reasoning to discover
properties of intersecting and parallel lines. We will continue to do
this as we explore geometry.
Can we say anything about the existence of a triangle having sidelengths
3 cm, 3 cm and 7 cm? Verify your answer by construction.
“In the rough diagram in Fig. 7.4, is it possible to assign
lengths in a different order such that the direct paths are
always coming out to be shorter than the roundabout
paths? If this is possible, then a triangle might exist.”
Is such rearrangement of lengths possible in the triangle?

Figure it Out
1. We checked by construction that there are no triangles having
sidelengths 3 cm, 4 cm and 8 cm; and 2 cm, 3 cm and 6 cm. Check if
you could have found this without trying to construct the triangle.
2. Can we say anything about the existence of a triangle for each of
the following sets of lengths?
(a) 10 km, 10 km and 25 km
(b) 5 mm, 10 mm and 20 mm
(c)

12 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm

You would have realised that using a rough figure and comparing
the direct path lengths with their corresponding roundabout path
lengths is the same as comparing each length with the sum of the other
two lengths. There are three such comparisons to be made.
3. For each set of lengths seen so far, you might have noticed that
in at least two of the comparisons, the direct length was less
than the sum of the other two (if not, check again!). For example,
for the set of lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm, there are two
comparisons where this happens:

Try
This

10 < 15 + 30
15 < 10 + 30
But this doesn’t happen for the third length: 30 > 10 + 15.
Will this always happen? That is, for any set of lengths, will there be at
least two comparisons where the direct length is less than the sum of
the other two? Explore for different sets of lengths.
Further, for a given set of lengths, is it possible to identify which
lengths will immediately be less than the sum of the other two, without
calculations?
[Hint: Consider the direct lengths in the increasing order.]
Given three sidelengths, what do we need to compare to check for the
existence of a triangle?
When each length is smaller than the sum of the other two, we say
that the lengths satisfy the triangle inequality. For example, the set 3,
4, 5 satisfies the triangle inequality whereas, the set 10, 15, 30 does not
satisfy the triangle inequality.
We have seen that lengths such as 10, 15, 30 that do not satisfy the
triangle inequality cannot be the sidelengths of a triangle.
154

Chapter-7.indd 154

4/11/2025 7:31:56 PM

A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines

Does a triangle exist with sidelengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 8 cm?
This satisfies the triangle inequality:
8<4+5=9
Why do we not need to check the other two sides?
This means that all the direct path lengths are less than the
roundabout path lengths. Does this confirm the existence of a triangle?
If one of the direct path lengths had been longer, we could have
concluded that a triangle would surely not exist. But in this case, we
can only say that a triangle may or may not exist.
For the triangle to exist, the arcs that we construct to get the third
vertex must intersect. Is it possible to determine that this will happen
without actually carrying out the construction?
Visualising the construction of circles
Let us imagine that we start the construction by constructing the
longest side as the base. Let AB be the base of length 8 cm. The next
step is the construction of sufficiently long arcs corresponding to the
other two lengths: 4 cm and 5 cm.
Instead of just constructing the arcs, let us complete the full circles.
Suppose, we construct a circle of radius 4 cm with A as the centre.

Now, suppose that a circle of radius 5 cm is constructed, centred at B.
Can you draw a rough diagram of the resulting figure?
Note that in the figure below, AX = 4 cm and AB = 8 cm. So, what is
BX? Does this length help in visualising the resulting figure?

155

Chapter-7.indd 155

4/11/2025 7:31:56 PM

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7

Since BX = 4 cm, and the radius of the circle centred at B is 5 cm, it is
clear that the circles will intersect each other at two points.

Fig. 7.5: Circles intersecting each other at two points

What does this tell us about the existence of a triangle? The points
A and B along with either of the points of intersection of the circles
will give us the required triangle. Thus, there exists a triangle having
sidelengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 8 cm.
Figure it Out
1. Which of the following lengths can be the sidelengths of a triangle?
Explain your answers. Note that for each set, the three lengths have
the same unit of measure.

We observe from the previous problems that whenever there is
a set of lengths satisfying the triangle inequality (each length <
sum of the other two lengths), there is a triangle with those three
lengths as sidelengths.
Will triangles always exist when a set of lengths satisfies the triangle
inequality? How can we be sure?

156

We can be sure of the existence of a triangle only if we can show that
the circles intersect internally (as in Fig. 7.5) whenever the triangle
inequality is satisfied. But are there other possibilities when the two
circles are constructed? Let us visualise and study them.
The following different cases can be conceived:

A

B

A

Case 1: Circles touch each other

Case 2: Circles do not intersect

B

Case 3: Circles intersect each other internally
Note that while constructing the circles, we take
(a)

the length of the base AB = longest of the given length

(b)

the radii of the circles to be the smaller two lengths.

Which of the above-mentioned cases will lead to the formation of a
triangle? Clearly, triangles are formed only when the circles intersect
each other internally (Case 3).
Let us study each of these cases by finding the relation between the
radii (the smaller two lengths) and AB (longest length).
Case 1: Circles touch each other at a point
For this case to happen,
sum of the two radii = AB
or
sum of the two smaller lengths = longest length

AB is composed of one radius and a part of the other. So,
sum of the two radii > AB,
or
sum of the two smaller lengths > longest length
Can we use this analysis to tell if a triangle exists when the lengths
satisfy the triangle inequality?
If the given lengths satisfy the triangle inequality, then the sum of
the two smaller lengths is greater than the longest length. This means
that this will lead to Case 3 where the circles intersect internally, and
so a triangle exists.
How will the two circles turn out for a set of lengths that do not satisfy
the triangle inequality? Find 3 examples of sets of lengths for which
the circles:
(a)
(b)

If a given set of three lengths satisfies the triangle inequality, then a
triangle exists having those as sidelengths. If the set does not satisfy the
triangle inequality, then a triangle with those sidelengths does not exist.

As in the case when we are given all three sides, it turns out that
there is not always a triangle for every combination of two angles and
the included side.
Find examples of measurements of two angles with the included side
where a triangle is not possible.
Let us try to visualise such a situation. Once the base is drawn, try to
imagine how the other sides should be so that they do not meet.
Here are some obvious examples.

If the two angles are greater than or equal to a right angle (90°), then
it is clear that a triangle is not possible.
Now we make one of the base angles an acute angle, say 40°. What
are the possible values that the other angle should take so that the lines

The blue line is the line with the least rightward bend that doesn’t

Visually, it is clear that the line that creates the smallest ∠B has to be
the one parallel to l. Let us call this parallel line m.
Can you tell the actual value of ∠B be in this case?
[Hint: Note that AB is the transversal.]
We have seen that when two lines are parallel, the internal angles
on the same side of the transversal add up to 180°. So ∠B = 140°.
So, for what values of ∠B, does a triangle not exist? Does the length
AB play any part here?
From the discussion above, it can be seen that the length AB does not
play any part in deciding the existence of a triangle. We can say that a
triangle does not exist when ∠B is greater than or equal to 140°.
Figure it Out

triangle is (a) possible, (b) not possible. Find at least two different

Can the sum of the two angles be used for framing this rule?

When the sum of two given angles is less than 180°, a triangle exists
with these angles. If the sum is greater than or equal to 180°, there is
no triangle with these angles.
Let us take two angles, say 60° and 70°, whose sum is less than 180°.
Let the included side be 5 cm.
What could the measure of the third angle be? Does this measure
change if the base length is changed to some other value, say 7 cm?
Construct and find out.
In general, once the two angles are fixed, does the third angle depend
on the included sidelength? Try with different pairs of angles and
lengths.
The measurements might show that the sidelength has no effect (or
a very small effect) on the third angle. With this observation, let us see
if we can find the third angle without carrying out the construction
and measurement.
Try experimenting with different triangles to see if there is a
relation between any two angles and the third one. To find this
relation, what data will you keep track of and how will you
organise the data you collect?

Let us suppose we construct a line XY

Since the line XY is parallel to BC,
∠XAB = ∠B and ∠YAC = ∠C, because they are alternate angles of the

Therefore, ∠XAB = 50°, and ∠YAC = 70°. Can we find ∠BAC from this?
We know that ∠XAB, ∠YAC and ∠BAC together form 180°. So
∠XAB + ∠YAC + ∠BAC = 180°
50° + ∠BAC + 70° = 180°
120° + ∠BAC = 180°
Thus, ∠BAC = 60°
Now construct a triangle (taking BC to be of any suitable length) and
verify if this is indeed the case.

Angle Sum Property
What can we say about the sum of the angles of any triangle?
Consider a triangle ABC. To find the sum of its angles, we can use
the same method of drawing a line parallel to the base: construct a line
through A that is parallel to BC.

We need to find ∠A + ∠B + ∠C.
We know that ∠B = ∠XAB, ∠C = ∠YAC.
So, ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = ∠A + ∠XAB + ∠YAC
				
= 180° as together they form a straight angle.
Thus we have proved that the sum of the three angles in any triangle
is 180°! This rather surprising result is called the angle sum property
of triangles.

Take some time to reflect upon how we figured out the angle sum
property. In the beginning, the relationship between the third angle
and the other two angles was not at all clear. However, a simple idea of
drawing a line parallel to the base through the top vertex (as in Fig. 7.7)
suddenly made the relationship obvious. This ingenious idea can be
found in a very influential book in the history of mathematics called
‘The Elements’. This book is attributed to the Greek mathematician
Euclid, who lived around 300 BCE.
This solution is yet another example of how creative thinking plays
a key role in mathematics!
There is a convenient way of verifying the angle sum property by
folding a triangular cut-out of a paper. Do you see how this shows that
the sum of the angles in this triangle is 180°?

Exterior Angles
The angle formed between the extension of a side of a triangle and
the other side is called an exterior angle of the triangle. In this figure,
∠ACD is an exterior angle.

Find ∠ACD, if ∠A = 50°, and ∠B = 60°.
From the angle sum property, we know that
50° + 60° + ∠ACB = 180°
110° + ∠ACB = 180°
So, ∠ACB = 70°
So, ∠ACD = 180 ° – 70° = 110°,
since, ∠ACB and ∠ACD together form a straight angle.
Find the exterior angle for different measures of ∠A and ∠B. Do you
see any relation between the exterior angle and these two angles?
[Hint: From angle sum property, we have ∠A + ∠B + ∠ACB = 180°.]
We also have ∠ACD + ∠ACB = 180°, since they form a straight angle.
What does this show?

7.4 Constructions Related to Altitudes of Triangles
There is another set of useful measurements with respect to a triangle —
the height of each of its vertices with respect to the opposite sides.
In the world around us, we talk of the
A
heights of various objects: the height of a
person, the height of a tree, the height of
a building, etc. What do we mean by the
word ‘height’?
Consider a triangle ABC. What is the
height of the vertex A from its opposite B
D
C
Fig. 7.8
side BC, and how can it be measured?
Let AD be the line segment from A drawn perpendicular to BC. The
length of AD is the height of the vertex A from BC. The line segment AD
is said to be one of the ‘altitudes’ of the triangle. The other altitudes
167

are BE and CF in the figure below: the perpendiculars drawn from the
other vertices to their respective opposite sides.

C

Whenever we use the word height of the triangle, we generally
refer to the length of the altitude to whatever side we take as base (this
altitude is AD in the case of Fig. 7.8).
What would the altitude from A to BC be in this triangle?

We extend BC and then drop the perpendicular from A to this line.

Altitudes Using Paper Folding
Cut out a paper triangle. Fix one of the sides as the base. Fold it in
such a way that the resulting crease is an altitude from the top vertex
to the base. Justify why the crease formed should be perpendicular to
the base.

Construction of the Altitudes of a Triangle
Construct an arbitrary triangle. Label the vertices A, B, C taking BC to
be the base.
Construct the altitude from A to BC,
Constructing the altitude using just a ruler is not accurate. To get a
more precise angle of 90°, we use a set square along with a ruler.
Can you see how to do this?

right angle.
Triangles having one right angle are called right-angled triangles
or simply right triangles.

7.5 Types of Triangles
In our study of triangles, we have encountered the following types of
triangles; equilateral, isosceles, scalene and right-angled triangles.
Did you spot any other type of triangle?
The classification of triangles as equilateral and isosceles was based
on equality of sides.
Equilateral triangles have sides of equal length. Isosceles triangles
have two sides of equal length. Scalene triangles have sides of three
different lengths.

Can a similar classification be done based on equality of angles? Is
there any relation between these two classifications? We will answer
these questions in a later chapter.
We used angle measures when classifying a triangle as a rightangled triangle.
What are the other types of triangles based on angle measures?
A classification of triangles based on their angle measures is acuteangled, right-angled and obtuse-angled triangles. We have already
seen what a right-angled triangle is. It is a triangle with one right angle.
Similarly, an obtuse-angled triangle has one obtuse angle.
What could an acute-angled triangle be? Can we define it as a
triangle with one acute angle? Why not?

In an acute-angled triangle, all three angles are acute angles.

equilateral triangle that is (i) right-angled (ii) obtuse-angled.

SUMMARY

•
•
•

•

Use of a compass simplifies the construction of triangles when the
sidelengths are given.
A set of three lengths where the length of each is smaller than the
sum of the other two is said to satisfy the triangle inequality.
Sidelengths of a triangle satisfy triangle inequality, and, if a given set
of lengths satisfy the triangle inequality, a triangle can be constructed
with those sidelengths.
Triangles can be constructed when the following measurements are
given:
(a) two of the sides and their included angle
(b) two angles and the included side
The sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180°.
An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a
vertex to its opposite side.
Equilateral triangles have sides of equal length. Isosceles triangles
have two sides of equal length. Scalene triangles have sides of three
different lengths.
Triangles are classified based on their angle measures as
acute-angled, right-angled and obtuse-angled triangles.

WORKING WITH
FRACTIONS

8.1 Multiplication of Fractions
Aaron walks 3 kilometres in 1 hour.
How far can he walk in 5 hours?
This is a simple question. We know
that to find the distance, we need to
find the product of 5 and 3, i.e., we
multiply 5 and 3.
Distance covered in 1 hour = 3 km.
Therefore,
Distance covered in 5 hours
= 5 × 3 km
= 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 km
= 15 km.
Aaron’s pet tortoise walks at a much slower pace. It can walk only 1
4
kilometre in 1 hour. How far can it walk in 3 hours?
Here, the distance covered in an hour is a fraction. This does not
matter. The total distance covered is calculated in the same way, as
multiplication.

(7 and 24) first and then simplifying, we could do the following:
12 × 5 = 12 × 5
7 24 7 × 24
We see that both the circled numbers have a common factor of 12.
We know that a fraction remains the same when the numerator and
denominator are divided by the common factor. In this case, we can
divide them by 12.

A Pinch of History
In India, the process of reducing a fraction to its lowest terms — known
as apavartana — is so well known that it finds mention even in a
non-mathematical work. A Jaina scholar Umasvati (c. 150 CE) used it as
a simile in a philosophical work.

Is the Product Always Greater than the Numbers
Multiplied?
Since, we know that when a number is multiplied by 1, the product
remains unchanged, we will look at multiplying pairs of numbers
where neither of them is 1.
When we multiply two counting numbers greater than 1, say 3 and
5, the product is greater than both the numbers being multiplied.
3 × 5 = 15
The product, 15, is more than both 3 and 5.
But what happens when we multiply 1 and 8?

let us express 3 as 15 and 2 as 8 .

From this we can see that the product is less than both the numbers.
When do you think the product is greater than both the numbers
multiplied, when is it in between the two numbers, and when is it
smaller than both?
[Hint: The relationship between the product and the numbers
multiplied depends on whether they are between 0 and 1 or they
are greater than 1. Take different pairs of numbers and observe their
product. For each multiplication, consider the following questions.]
Situation

Situation 1

Both numbers are
greater than 1

Create more such examples for each situation and observe the
relationship between the product and the numbers being multiplied.
What can you conclude about the relationship between the numbers
multiplied and the product? Fill in the blanks:
• When one of the numbers being multiplied is between 0 and 1,
the product is ____________ (greater/less) than the other number.
• When one of the numbers being multiplied is greater than 1, the

In each of the division problems above, observe how we found the
answer. Can we frame a rule that tells us how to divide two fractions?
Let us consider the previous problem.

a dividend, divisor and quotient. The

technique we have been using to get
the quotient is:

1. First, find the number which gives
1 when multiplied by the divisor.

We see that the resulting number is
a fraction whose numerator is the
divisor’s denominator and denominator is the divisor’s numerator.

For the divisor 3 this fraction is 5. We call 5 the reciprocal of 3.
5
3

When we multiply a fraction by its reciprocal, we get 1. So, the first
step in our technique is to find the divisor’s reciprocal.

2. We then multiply the dividend with this reciprocal to get the
quotient.
Summarising, to divide two fractions:
• Find the reciprocal of the divisor
• Multiply this by the dividend to get the quotient.
So,

a c d a d×a
÷ = × =

b d c b c×b

This can be rewritten as:

together, in how much time will they fill the cistern?
Let us solve this problem step by step.

So, one cowrie shell was given to the beggar.
You can see in the answer Bhāskarāchārya’s humour! The miser had
given the beggar only one coin of the least value (cowrie).
Around the 12th century, several types of coins were in use in
different kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent. Most commonly used
were gold coins (called dinars/gadyanas and hunas), silver coins (called
drammas/tankas), copper coins (called kasus/panas and mashakas), and
cowrie shells. The exact conversion rates between these coins varied
depending on the region, time period, economic conditions, weights of
coins and their purity.
Gold coins had high-value and were used in large transactions and
to store wealth. Silver coins were more commonly used in everyday
transactions. Copper coins had low-value and were used in smaller
transactions. Cowrie shells were the lowest denomination and were
used in very small transactions and as change.
If we assume 1 gold dinar = 12 silver drammas, 1 silver dramma = 4
copper panas, 1 copper pana = 6 mashakas, and 1 pana = 30 cowrie shells,
1 copper pana =

A Pinch of History
As you have seen, fractions are an important type of number, playing
a critical role in a variety of everyday problems that involve sharing
and dividing quantities equally. The general notion of non-unit fractions
as we use them today — equipped with the arithmetic operations of
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — developed largely in
India. The ancient Indian geometry texts called the Śhulbasūtra — which
go back as far as 800 BCE, and were concerned with the construction
of fire altars for rituals — used general non-unit fractions extensively,
including performing division of such fractions as we saw in Example 3.
Fractions even became commonplace in the popular culture of
India as far back as 150 BCE, as evidenced by an offhand reference to
the reduction of fractions to lowest terms in the philosophical work of
the revered Jain scholar Umasvati.

Working with Fractions

General rules for performing arithmetic operations on fractions —
in essentially the modern form in which we carry them out today —
were first codified by Brahmagupta in his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in
628 CE. We have already seen his methods for adding and subtracting
general fractions. For multiplying general fractions, Brahmagupta
wrote:
“Multiplication of two or more fractions is obtained by taking the
product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators.”
(Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.1.3)
That is,

a c
a×c
.
× =
b×d
				b d

For division of general fractions, Brahmagupta wrote:
“The division of fractions is performed by interchanging the numerator
and denominator of the divisor; the numerator of the dividend is then
multiplied by the (new) numerator, and the denominator by the (new)
denominator.”
Bhāskara II in his book Līlāvatī in 1150 CE clarifies Brahmagupta‘s
statement further in terms of the notion of reciprocal:
“Division of one fraction by another is equivalent to multiplication of
the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.” (Līlāvatī, Verse 2.3.40)
Both of these verses are equivalent to the formula:
a c
a d
a×d
.
÷ = × =
b d
b c
b×c
Bhāskara I, in his 629 CE commentary Āryabhaṭīyabhāṣhya on
Aryabhata’s 499 CE work, described the
geometric interpretation of multiplication
of fractions (that we saw earlier) in terms
of the division of a square into rectangles
via equal divisions along the length and
breadth.
Many other Indian mathematicians,
such as Śhrīdharāchārya (c. 750 CE),
Mahāvīrāchārya (c. 850 CE), Caturveda 1 1
Pṛithūdakasvāmī (c. 860 CE), and Bhāskara II 4 20

SUMMARY
•

Brahmagupta’s formula for multiplication of fractions:

•

When multiplying fractions, if the numerators and denominators
have some common factors, we can cancel them first before
multiplying the numerators and denominators.
In multiplication — when one of the numbers being multiplied is

Chess Puzzles —
Non-attacking Queens
Chess is a popular 2-player strategy game. This game has its origins
in India. It is played on an 8 × 8 chequered grid. There are 2 sets of
pieces — black and white — one set for each player. Find out how
each piece should move and the rules of the game.
Here is a famous chess-based puzzle. From its current position,
a Queen piece can move along the horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
Place 4 Queens such that no 2 queens attack each other. For example,
the arrangement below is not valid as the queens are in the line of
attack of each other.

Now, place 8 queens on this 8 × 8 grid so that no 2 queens attack
each other!
