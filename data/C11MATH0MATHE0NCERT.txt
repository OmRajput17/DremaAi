SETS

vIn these days of conflict between ancient and modern studies; there
must surely be something to be said for a study which did not

begin with Pythagoras and will not end with Einstein; but
is the oldest and the youngest.   — G.H. HARDY v

1.1  Introduction

The concept of set serves as a fundamental part of the
present day mathematics. Today this concept is being used
in almost every branch of mathematics. Sets are used to
define the concepts of relations and functions. The study of
geometry, sequences, probability, etc. requires the knowledge
of sets.

The theory of sets was developed by German
mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). He first
encountered sets while working on “problems on trigonometric
series”. In this Chapter, we discuss some basic definitions

and operations involving sets.

(1845-1918)

1.2  Sets and their Representations

In everyday life, we often speak of collections of objects of a particular kind, such as,
a pack of cards, a crowd of people, a cricket team, etc. In mathematics also, we come
across collections, for example, of natural numbers, points, prime numbers, etc. More
specially, we examine the following collections:

(i) Odd natural numbers less than 10, i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
(ii) The rivers of India
(iii) The vowels in the English alphabet, namely, a, e, i, o, u
(iv) Various kinds of triangles
(v) Prime factors of 210, namely, 2,3,5 and 7
(vi) The solution of the equation: x2 – 5x + 6 = 0, viz, 2 and 3.

We note that each of the above example is a well-defined collection of objects in

the sense that we can definitely decide whether a given particular object belongs to a
given collection or not. For example, we can say that the river Nile does not belong to
the collection of rivers of India. On the other hand, the river Ganga does belong to this
colleciton.

We give below a few more examples of sets used particularly in mathematics, viz.

N : the set of all natural numbers
Z : the set of all integers
Q : the set of all rational numbers
R : the set of real numbers
Z+ : the set of positive integers
Q+ : the set of positive rational numbers, and

R+ : the set of positive real numbers.
The symbols for the special sets given above will be referred to throughout

this text.
Again the collection of five most renowned mathematicians of the world is not

well-defined, because the criterion for determining a mathematician as most renowned
may vary from person to person. Thus, it is not a well-defined collection.

We shall say that a set is a well-defined collection of objects.
The following points may be noted :

(i) Objects, elements and members of a set are synonymous  terms.
(ii) Sets are usually denoted by capital letters A, B, C, X, Y, Z, etc.
(iii) The elements of a set are represented by small letters a, b, c, x, y, z, etc.

If a is an element of a set A, we say that “ a belongs to A” the Greek symbol ∈
(epsilon) is used to denote the phrase ‘belongs to’. Thus, we write a ∈ A. If ‘b’ is not
an element of a set A, we write b ∉ A and read  “b does not belong to A”.

Thus, in the set V of vowels in the English alphabet, a ∈ V but b ∉ V. In the set
P of prime factors of 30, 3 ∈ P but 15 ∉ P.
There are two methods of representing a set :

(i) Roster or tabular form
(ii) Set-builder form.

(i) In roster form, all the elements of a set are listed, the elements are being separated
by commas and are enclosed within braces {   }. For example, the set of all even
positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as {2, 4, 6}. Some more
examples of representing a set in roster form are given below :

(a) The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42}.

Reprint 2025-26



SETS        3

ANote  In roster form, the order in which the elements are listed is immaterial.

Thus, the above set can also be represented as {1, 3, 7, 21, 2, 6, 14, 42}.

(b) The set of all vowels in the English alphabet is {a, e, i, o, u}.
(c) The set of odd natural numbers is represented by {1, 3, 5, . . .}. The dots

tell us that the list of odd numbers continue indefinitely.

ANote  It may be noted that while writing the set in roster form an element is not

generally repeated, i.e., all the elements are taken as distinct. For example, the set
of letters forming the word ‘SCHOOL’ is { S, C, H, O, L} or {H, O, L, C, S}. Here,
the order of listing elements has no relevance.

(ii) In set-builder form, all the elements of a set possess a single common property
which is not possessed by any element outside the set. For example, in the set
{a, e, i, o, u}, all the elements possess a common property, namely, each of them
is a vowel in the English alphabet, and no other letter possess this property. Denoting
this set by V, we write
V = {x : x is a vowel in English alphabet}
It may be observed that we describe the element of the set by using a symbol x

(any other symbol like the letters y, z, etc. could be used) which is followed by a colon
“ : ”. After the sign of colon, we write the characteristic property possessed by the
elements of the set and then enclose the whole description within braces. The above
description of the set V is read as “the set of all x such that x is a vowel of the English
alphabet”. In this description the braces stand for “the set of all”, the colon stands for
“such that”. For example, the set

A = {x : x is a natural number and 3 < x < 10} is read as “the set of all x such that
x is a natural number and x lies between 3 and 10.” Hence, the numbers 4, 5, 6,
7, 8 and 9 are the elements of the set A.
If we denote the sets described in (a), (b) and (c) above in roster form by A, B,

C, respectively, then A, B, C can also be represented in set-builder form as  follows:
A= {x : x is a natural number which divides 42}
B= {y : y is a vowel in the English alphabet}
C= {z : z is an odd natural number}

Example 1 Write the solution set of the equation x2 + x – 2 = 0 in roster form.

Solution The given equation can be written as
(x – 1)  (x + 2) = 0, i. e.,   x = 1, – 2

Therefore, the solution set of the given equation can be written in roster form as {1, – 2}.

Example 2 Write the set {x : x is a positive integer and x2 < 40} in the roster form.

Reprint 2025-26



4       MATHEMATICS

Solution The required numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, the given set in the roster form
is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Example 3 Write the set  A = {1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . . }in set-builder form.

Solution We may write the set A as
A = {x : x is the square of a natural number}

Alternatively, we can write
A = {x : x = n2, where n ∈ N}

1 2 3 4 5 6
Example 4 Write the set { , , , , , } in the set-builder form.

2 3 4 5 6 7

Solution We see that each member in the given set has the numerator one less than
the denominator. Also, the numerator begin from 1 and do not exceed 6. Hence, in the
set-builder form the given set is

 n 
x : x = , where n is a natural number and 1 ≤ n ≤ 6
 n +1 

Example 5 Match each of the set on the left described in the roster form with the
same set on the right described in the set-builder form :

(i) {P, R, I, N, C, A, L} (a) { x : x is a positive integer and is a divisor of 18}
(ii) { 0 } (b) { x : x is an integer and x2 – 9 = 0}
(iii) {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18} (c) {x : x is an integer and x + 1= 1}
(iv) {3, –3} (d) {x : x is a letter of the word PRINCIPAL}

Solution Since in (d), there are 9 letters in the word PRINCIPAL and two letters P and I
are repeated, so (i) matches (d). Similarly, (ii) matches (c) as x + 1 = 1 implies
x = 0. Also, 1, 2 ,3, 6, 9, 18 are all divisors of 18 and so (iii) matches (a). Finally, x2 – 9 = 0
implies x = 3, –3 and so (iv) matches (b).

(ii) {2, 3} (b) {x : x is an odd natural number less than 10}

(iv) {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} (d) {x : x is a letter of the word MATHEMATICS}.

1.3  The Empty Set

Consider the set
A = { x : x is a student of Class XI presently studying in a school }

We can go to the school and count the number of students presently studying in
Class XI in the school. Thus, the set A contains a finite number of elements.

We now write another set B as follows:

Reprint 2025-26



6       MATHEMATICS

B = { x : x is a student presently studying in both Classes X and XI }
We observe that a student cannot study simultaneously in both Classes X and XI.

Thus, the set B contains no element at all.

Definition 1 A set which does not contain any element is called the empty set or the
null set or the void set.

According to this definition, B is an empty set while A is not an empty set. The
empty set is denoted by the symbol φ or {   }.

We give below a few examples of empty sets.
(i) Let A = {x : 1 < x < 2, x is a natural number}. Then A is the empty set,

because there is no natural number between 1 and 2.
(ii) B = {x : x2 – 2 = 0 and x is rational number}. Then B is the empty set because

the equation x2 – 2 = 0 is not satisfied by any rational value of x.
(iii) C = {x : x is an even prime number greater than 2}.Then C is the empty set,

because 2 is the only even prime number.
(iv) D = { x : x2 = 4, x is odd }. Then D is the empty set, because the equation

x2 = 4 is not satisfied by any odd value of x.

1.4  Finite and Infinite Sets

Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, B = {a, b, c, d, e, g}
and C = { men living presently in different parts of the world}
We observe that A contains 5 elements and B contains 6 elements. How many elements
does C contain? As it is, we do not know the number of elements in C, but it is some
natural number which may be quite a big number. By number of elements of a set S,
we mean the number of distinct elements of the set and we denote it by n (S). If n (S)
is a natural number, then S is non-empty finite set.

Consider the set of natural numbers. We see that the number of elements of this
set is not finite since there are infinite number of natural numbers. We say that the set
of natural numbers is an infinite set. The sets A, B and C given above are finite sets
and n(A) = 5, n(B) = 6 and n(C) = some finite number.

Definition 2 A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is
called finite otherwise, the set is called infinite.

Consider some examples :
(i) Let W be the set of the days of the week. Then W is finite.

(ii) Let S be the set of solutions of the equation x2 –16 = 0. Then S is finite.
(iii) Let G be the set of points on a line. Then G is infinite.
When we represent a set in the roster form, we write all the elements of the set

within braces {   }. It is not possible to write all the elements of an infinite set within
braces {  } because the numbers of elements of such a set is not finite. So, we represent

Reprint 2025-26



SETS        7

some infinite set in the roster form by writing a few elements which clearly indicate the
structure of the set followed ( or preceded ) by three dots.

For example, {1, 2, 3 . . .} is the set of natural numbers, {1, 3, 5, 7, . . .} is the set
of odd natural numbers, {. . .,–3, –2, –1, 0,1, 2 ,3, . . .} is the set of integers. All these
sets are infinite.

ANote All infinite sets cannot be described in the roster form. For example, the

set of real numbers cannot be described in this form, because the elements of this
set do not follow any particular pattern.

Example 6 State which of the following sets are finite or infinite :
(i) {x : x ∈ N and (x – 1) (x –2) = 0}
(ii) {x : x ∈ N and x2 = 4}
(iii) {x : x ∈ N and 2x –1 = 0}
(iv) {x : x ∈ N and x is prime}
(v) {x : x ∈ N and x is odd}

Solution (i) Given set = {1, 2}. Hence, it is finite.
(ii) Given set = {2}. Hence, it is finite.
(iii) Given set = φ. Hence, it is finite.
(iv) The given set is the set of all prime numbers and since set of prime

numbers is infinite. Hence the given set is infinite
(v) Since there are infinite number of odd numbers, hence, the given set is

infinite.

1.5  Equal Sets

Given two sets A and B, if every element of A is also an element of B and if every
element of B is also an element of A, then the sets A and B are said to be equal.
Clearly, the two sets have exactly the same elements.

Definition 3 Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same
elements and we write A = B. Otherwise, the sets are said to be unequal and we write
A ≠ B.

We consider the following examples :
(i) Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 1, 4, 2}. Then A = B.
(ii) Let A be the set of prime numbers less than 6 and P the set of prime factors

of 30. Then A and P are equal, since 2, 3 and 5 are the only prime factors of
30 and also these are less than 6.

ANote  A set does not change if one or more elements of the set are repeated.

For example, the sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 2, 1, 3, 3} are equal, since each

Reprint 2025-26



8       MATHEMATICS

element of A is in B and vice-versa. That is why we generally do not repeat any
element in describing a set.

Example 7  Find the pairs of equal sets, if any, give reasons:
A = {0}, B = {x : x > 15 and x < 5},
C = {x : x – 5 = 0 }, D = {x: x2 = 25},
E = {x : x is an integral positive root of the equation x2 – 2x –15 = 0}.

Solution Since 0 ∈ A and 0 does not belong to any of the sets B, C, D and E, it
follows that,  A ≠ B, A ≠ C, A ≠ D, A ≠ E.

Since B = φ but none of the other sets are empty.  Therefore B ≠ C, B ≠ D
and B ≠ E. Also C = {5} but –5 ∈ D, hence C ≠ D.

Since E = {5}, C = E.  Further, D = {–5, 5} and E = {5}, we find that, D ≠ E.
Thus, the only pair of equal sets is C and E.

Example 8 Which of the following pairs of sets are equal? Justify your answer.
(i) X, the set of letters in “ALLOY” and B, the set of letters in “LOYAL”.
(ii) A =  {n : n ∈ Z and n2 ≤ 4} and B = {x : x ∈ R and x2 – 3x + 2 = 0}.

Solution (i) We have, X = {A, L, L, O, Y}, B = {L, O, Y, A, L}. Then X and B are
equal sets as repetition of elements in a set do not change a set. Thus,

X = {A, L, O, Y} = B
(ii) A = {–2, –1, 0, 1, 2},  B = {1, 2}. Since 0 ∈ A and 0 ∉ B,  A and B are not equal sets.

A = { 2, 4, 8, 12}, B = { 1, 2, 3, 4}, C = { 4, 8, 12, 14}, D = { 3, 1, 4, 2}
E = {–1, 1}, F = { 0, a}, G = {1, –1}, H = { 0, 1}

1.6  Subsets
Consider the sets : X = set of all students in your school, Y = set of all students in your
class.

We note that every element of Y is also an element of X; we say that Y is a subset
of X. The fact that Y is subset of X is expressed in symbols as Y ⊂ X. The symbol ⊂
stands for ‘is a subset of’ or ‘is contained in’.

Definition 4 A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an
element of B.

In other words, A ⊂ B if whenever a ∈ A, then a ∈ B. It is often convenient to
use the symbol “⇒” which means implies. Using this symbol, we can write the definiton
of subset as follows:

A ⊂ B if a ∈ A ⇒ a ∈ B

We read the above statement as “A is a subset of B if a is an element of A
implies that a is also an element of B”. If A is not a subset of B, we write A ⊄ B.

We may note that for A to be a subset of B, all that is needed is that every
element of A is in B. It is possible that every element of B may or may not be in A. If
it so happens that every element of B is also in A, then we shall also have B ⊂ A. In this
case, A and B are the same sets so that we have A ⊂ B and B ⊂  A ⇔ A = B, where
“⇔” is a symbol for two way implications, and is usually read as if and only if (briefly
written as “iff”).

It follows from the above definition that every set A is a subset of itself, i.e.,
A ⊂  A. Since the empty set φ has no elements, we agree to say that φ  is a subset of
every set. We now consider some examples :

Reprint 2025-26



10       MATHEMATICS

(i) The set Q of rational numbers is a subset of the set R of real numbes, and
we write Q ⊂ R.

(ii) If A is the set of all divisors  of 56 and B the set of all prime divisors of 56,
then B is a subset of A and we write B ⊂ A.

(iii) Let A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {x : x is an odd natural number less than 6}. Then
A ⊂ B and B ⊂ A and hence A = B.

(iv) Let A = { a, e, i, o, u} and B = { a, b, c, d}. Then A is not a subset of B,
also B is not a subset of A.

Let A and B be two sets. If A ⊂ B and A ≠ B , then A is called a proper subset
of B and B is called superset of A. For example,

A = {1, 2, 3} is a proper subset of B = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
If a set A has only one element, we call it a singleton set. Thus,{ a } is a

singleton set.

Example 9  Consider the sets
φ, A = { 1, 3 },   B = {1, 5, 9},   C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.

Insert the symbol ⊂ or ⊄ between each of the following pair of sets:

(i)  φ . . . B (ii) A . . . B (iii) A . . . C (iv) B . . . C

Solution (i) φ ⊂ B as φ is a subset of every set.
(ii) A ⊄ B as 3 ∈ A and 3 ∉ B
(iii) A ⊂ C as 1, 3 ∈ A also belongs to C
(iv) B  ⊂ C as each element of B is also an element of C.

Example 10  Let A = { a, e, i, o, u} and B = { a, b, c, d}. Is A a subset of B ? No.
(Why?). Is B a subset of  A? No. (Why?)

Example 11 Let A, B and C be three sets. If A ∈ B and B ⊂ C, is it true that
A ⊂ C?. If not, give an example.

Solution  No. Let A = {1}, B  = {{1}, 2} and C = {{1}, 2, 3}. Here A ∈ B as A = {1}
and B ⊂ C. But A ⊄ C as 1 ∈ A and 1 ∉ C.
Note that an element of a set can never be a subset of itself.

1.6.1  Subsets of set of real numbers
As noted in Section 1.6, there are many important subsets of R. We give below the
names of some of these subsets.

The set of natural numbers  N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .}
The set of integers Z = {. . ., –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}

p
The set of rational numbers Q = { x : x =  , p, q ∈  Z and q ≠ 0}

q

Reprint 2025-26



SETS        11

p
which is read “ Q is the set of all numbers x  such that x equals the quotient  , where

q

p and q  are integers and q is not zero”. Members of Q include  –5 (which can be

5 5 1 7 11
expressed  as – ) , , 3     (which can be expressed as ) and – .

1 7 2 2 3
The set of irrational numbers, denoted by T, is composed of all other real numbers.
Thus T = {x :  x ∈ R and x ∉ Q}, i.e., all real numbers that are not rational.

Members of T include  2  , 5  and π .

Some of the obvious relations among these subsets are:
N  ⊂  Z ⊂ Q, Q ⊂ R, T ⊂ R, N ⊄ T.

1.6.2  Intervals as subsets of R  Let a, b ∈ R and a < b. Then the set of real numbers
{ y : a < y < b} is called an open interval and is denoted by (a, b). All the points
between a and b belong to the open interval (a, b) but a, b themselves do not belong to
this interval.

The interval which contains the end points also is called closed interval and is
denoted by [ a, b ]. Thus

[ a, b ] = {x : a ≤ x ≤ b}
We can also have intervals closed at one end and open at the other, i.e.,

[ a, b ) = {x : a ≤ x < b} is an open interval from a to b, including a but excluding b.
( a, b ] = { x : a < x ≤  b } is an open interval from a to b including b but excluding a.
These notations provide an alternative way of designating the subsets of set of

real numbers. For example , if A = (–3, 5) and B = [–7, 9], then A ⊂ B. The set [ 0, ∞)
defines the set of non-negative real numbers, while set ( – ∞, 0 ) defines the set of
negative real numbers. The set ( – ∞, ∞ ) describes the set of real numbers in relation
to a line extending from – ∞ to ∞.

On real number line, various types of intervals described above as subsets of  R,
are shown in the Fig 1.1.

Fig 1.1

Here, we note that an interval contains infinitely many points.
For example, the set {x : x ∈ R, –5 < x ≤ 7}, written in set-builder form, can be

written in the form of interval as (–5, 7] and the interval [–3, 5) can be written in set-
builder form as {x : –3 ≤ x < 5}.

The number (b – a) is called the length of any of the intervals (a, b), [a, b],
[a, b)  or (a, b].

1.7  Universal Set

Usually, in a particular context, we have to deal with the elements and subsets of a
basic set which is relevant to that particular context.  For example, while studying the
system of numbers, we are interested in the set of natural numbers and its subsets such
as the set of all prime numbers, the set of all even numbers, and so forth. This basic set
is called the “Universal Set”.  The universal set is usually denoted by U, and all its
subsets by the letters A, B, C, etc.

For example, for the set of all integers, the universal set can be the set of rational
numbers or, for that matter, the set R of real numbers. For another example, in human
population studies, the universal set consists of all the people in the world.

1.8  Venn Diagrams
Most of the relationships between sets can be
represented by means of diagrams which are known
as Venn diagrams. Venn diagrams are named after
the English logician, John Venn (1834-1883). These
diagrams consist of rectangles and  closed curves
usually circles. The universal set is represented
usually by a rectangle and its subsets by circles.

In Venn diagrams, the elements of the sets are
written in their respective circles (Figs 1.2 and 1.3) Fig 1.2

Illustration 1 In Fig 1.2, U = {1,2,3, ..., 10} is the
universal set of which

A = {2,4,6,8,10} is a subset.

Illustration 2 In Fig 1.3, U = {1,2,3, ..., 10} is the
universal set of which

A = {2,4,6,8,10} and B = {4, 6} are subsets,
and also B ⊂ A.

Fig 1.3
The reader will see an extensive use of the

Venn diagrams when we discuss the union, intersection and difference of sets.

1.9  Operations on Sets
In earlier classes, we have learnt how to perform the operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division on numbers. Each one of these operations was performed
on a pair of numbers to get another number. For example, when we perform the
operation of addition on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get the number 18. Again,
performing the operation of multiplication on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get 65.

14       MATHEMATICS

Similarly, there are some operations which when performed on two sets give rise to
another set. We will now define certain operations on sets and examine their properties.
Henceforth, we will refer all our sets as subsets of some universal set.

1.9.1  Union of sets  Let A and B be any two sets. The union of  A and B is the set
which consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B, the common elements
being taken only once. The symbol ‘∪’ is used to denote the union. Symbolically, we
write A ∪ B and usually read as ‘A union B’.

Example 12 Let A = { 2, 4, 6, 8} and B = { 6, 8, 10, 12}. Find A ∪ B.

Solution  We have  A ∪ B  = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}
Note that the common elements 6 and 8 have been taken only once while writing
A ∪ B.

Example 13   Let A = { a, e, i, o, u } and B = { a, i, u }. Show that A ∪ B  = A

Solution We have, A ∪ B = { a, e, i, o, u } = A.

This example illustrates that union of sets A and its subset B is the set A
itself, i.e., if B ⊂ A, then A ∪ B = A.

Example 14 Let X = {Ram, Geeta, Akbar} be the set of students of Class XI, who are
in school hockey team. Let Y = {Geeta, David, Ashok} be the set of students from
Class XI who are in the school football team. Find X ∪ Y and interpret the set.

Solution We have, X ∪ Y = {Ram, Geeta, Akbar, David, Ashok}. This is the set of
students from Class XI who are in the hockey team or the football team or both.

Thus, we can define the union of two sets as follows:

Definition 5 The union of two sets A and B is the set C which consists of all those
elements which are either in A or in B (including
those which are in both). In symbols, we write.
A ∪ B  = { x : x ∈A or x ∈B }

The union of two sets can be represented by
a Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.4.

The shaded portion in Fig 1.4 represents A ∪ B.

Some Properties of the Operation of Union
(i) A ∪ B  = B ∪ A  (Commutative law) Fig 1.4

(ii) ( A ∪ B ) ∪ C = A ∪ ( B ∪ C)
     (Associative law )

(iii) A ∪ φ = A      (Law of identity element, φ is the identity of ∪)

SETS        15

(iv) A ∪ A  = A      (Idempotent law)

(v) U ∪ A  = U      (Law of U)

1.9.2  Intersection of sets  The intersection of sets A and B is the set of all elements
which are common to both A and B. The symbol ‘∩’ is used to denote the intersection.
The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which belong to
both A and B. Symbolically, we write A ∩ B = {x :  x ∈ A and x ∈ B}.

Example 15 Consider the sets A and B of Example 12. Find A ∩ B.

Solution We see that 6, 8 are the only elements which are common to both A and B.
Hence  A ∩ B = { 6, 8 }.

Example 16 Consider the sets X and Y of Example 14. Find X ∩ Y.

Solution We see that element ‘Geeta’ is the only element common to both. Hence,
X ∩ Y = {Geeta}.

Example 17 Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and B = { 2, 3, 5, 7 }. Find A  ∩ B and
hence show that A ∩ B = B.

Solution We have A ∩ B = { 2, 3, 5, 7 } = B. We
note that B ⊂ A and that A ∩ B = B.

Definition 6 The intersection of two sets A and B
is the set of all those elements which belong to both
A and B. Symbolically, we write

A ∩ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}

The shaded portion in Fig 1.5 indicates the Fig 1.5
intersection of A and B.
If A and B are two sets such that A ∩ B =  φ,  then U
A and B are called disjoint sets.

For example, let A = { 2, 4, 6, 8 } and
B = { 1, 3, 5, 7 }. Then A and B are disjoint sets, A B

because there are no elements which are common to
A and B. The disjoint sets can be represented by
means of Venn diagram as shown in the Fig 1.6
In the above diagram, A and B are disjoint sets. Fig 1.6
Some Properties of Operation of Intersection

(i) A ∩ B  = B ∩ A (Commutative law).
(ii) ( A  ∩ B ) ∩ C = A ∩ ( B ∩ C ) (Associative law).
(iii) φ ∩ A = φ, U ∩ A = A (Law of φ and U).
(iv) A ∩ A = A (Idempotent law)

(v) A ∩ ( B ∪ C )   =  ( A ∩ B ) ∪ ( A ∩ C ) (Distributive law ) i. e.,
∩ distributes over ∪

1.9.3  Difference of sets  The difference of the sets A and B in this order is the set
of elements which belong to A but  not to B. Symbolically, we write A – B and read as
“A minus B”.

Example 18  Let A = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, B = { 2, 4, 6, 8 }. Find A – B and B – A.

Solution We have, A – B = { 1, 3, 5 }, since the elements 1, 3, 5 belong to A but
not to B and B – A = { 8 }, since the element 8 belongs to B and not to A.
We note that A – B ≠ B – A.

SETS        17

Example 19 Let V = { a, e, i, o, u } and
B = { a, i, k, u}. Find V – B and B – V

Solution  We have, V – B = { e, o }, since the elements
e, o belong to V but not to B and B – V = { k }, since
the element k belongs to B but not to V.

We note that V – B ≠ B – V.  Using the set-
builder notation, we can rewrite the definition of

Fig 1.8
difference as

A – B = { x : x ∈ A and x ∉ B }
The difference of two sets A and B can be

represented by Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.8.
The shaded portion represents the difference of

the two sets A and B.

Remark The sets A – B, A ∩ B and B – A are
mutually disjoint sets, i.e., the intersection of any of Fig 1.9
these two sets is the null set as shown in Fig 1.9.

1.10  Complement of a Set

Let U be the universal set which consists of all prime numbers and A be the subset of

U which consists of all those prime numbers that are not divisors of 42. Thus,

 A = {x : x ∈  U and x is not a divisor of 42 }. We see that 2 ∈ U but 2 ∉ A, because

2 is divisor of 42. Similarly, 3 ∈ U but 3 ∉ A, and 7 ∈ U but 7 ∉ A. Now 2, 3 and 7 are

the only elements of U which do not belong to A. The set of these three prime numbers,

i.e., the set {2, 3, 7} is called the Complement of A with respect to U, and is denoted by
A′. So we have   A′ = {2, 3, 7}. Thus, we see that

A′  = {x : x ∈ U and x ∉ A }. This leads to the following definition.

Definition 7 Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of
A is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A. Symbolically, we
write A′ to denote  the complement of A with respect to U. Thus,

A′ = {x : x ∈ U and x ∉ A }. Obviously A′ = U – A
We note that the complement of a set A can be looked upon, alternatively, as the

difference between a universal set U and the set A.

Reprint 2025-26



SETS        19

Example  20 Let U =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Find A′.
Solution  We note that 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are the only elements of U which do not belong to
A. Hence  A′ = { 2, 4, 6, 8,10 }.

Example 21 Let U be universal set of all the students of Class XI of a coeducational
school and A be the set of all girls in Class XI. Find A′.

Solution Since A is the set of all girls, A′ is clearly the set of all boys in the class.

ANote   If A is a subset of the universal set U, then its complement A′  is also a

subset of U.
Again in Example 20 above, we have  A′ = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }

Hence              (A′ )′= {x : x ∈ U and x ∉ A′}
= {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} = A

It is clear from the definition of the complement that for any subset of the universal

set U, we have          ( A′ )′  = A

Now, we want to find the results for ( A ∪ B )′  and A′ ∩ B′ in the followng

example.

Example 22 Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, A = {2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}.

Find A′, B′ ,  A′  ∩ B′, A ∪ B and hence show that (  A ∪ B )′  = A′ ∩ B′.

Solution Clearly A′ = {1, 4, 5, 6}, B′ = { 1, 2, 6 }. Hence A′ ∩ B′ = { 1, 6 }

Also A ∪ B  = { 2, 3, 4, 5 }, so that (A ∪ B )′   = { 1, 6 }

    ( A ∪ B )′  = { 1, 6 } =  A′ ∩ B′
It can be shown that the above result is true in general. If A and B are any two

subsets of the universal set U, then

( A ∪ B )′   = A′ ∩ B′. Similarly, ( A ∩ B )′   =  A′  ∪ B′ . These two results are stated

in words as follows :
The complement of the union of two sets is

the intersection of their complements and the
complement of the intersection of two sets is the
union of their complements. These are called De
Morgan’s laws. These are named after the
mathematician De Morgan.
The complement A′ of a set A can be represented
by a Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.10. Fig 1.10

The shaded portion represents the complement of the set A.

Example 24 List all the subsets of the set { –1, 0, 1 }.

Solution  Let  A = { –1, 0, 1 }. The subset of  A having no element is the empty

A having two elements are {–1, 0}, {–1, 1} ,{0, 1}. The subset of A having three
elements of A is A itself. So, all the subsets of A are φ, {–1}, {0}, {1}, {–1, 0}, {–1, 1},
{0, 1} and {–1, 0, 1}.

Example 25 Show that A ∪  B =  A ∩ B implies  A = B

Solution Let a ∈ A. Then a ∈ A ∪ B. Since A ∪ B = A  ∩ B , a ∈ A  ∩ B. So a ∈ B.
Therefore, A ⊂  B. Similarly, if  b ∈ B, then b ∈ A ∪ B. Since

A ∪ B = A ∩ B, b ∈ A ∩ B. So, b ∈ A. Therefore, B ⊂ A. Thus,  A = B

Summary

This chapter deals with some basic definitions and operations involving sets. These
are summarised below:

®A set is a well-defined collection of objects.

®A set which does not contain any element is called empty set.

®A set which consists of a definite number of elements is called finite set,

®Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements.

®A set A is said to be subset of a set B, if every element of A is also an element
of B. Intervals are subsets of R.

®The union of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which are either
in A or in B.

®The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements which are
common. The difference of two sets A and B in this order is the set of elements
which belong to A but not to B.

®The complement of a subset A of universal set U is the set of all elements of U
which are not the elements of A.

Historical Note

The modern theory of sets is considered to have been originated largely by the
German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His papers on set theory

appeared sometimes during 1874 to 1897. His study of set  theory came when he
was studying trigonometric series of the form a  sin x + a  sin 2x + a  sin 3x + ...

1 2 3

He published in a paper in 1874  that the set of real numbers could not be put into
one-to-one correspondence wih the integers. From 1879 onwards, he publishd

several papers showing various properties of abstract sets.

SETS        23

Cantor’s work was well received by another famous mathematician Richard

Dedekind (1831-1916). But Kronecker (1810-1893) castigated him for regarding
infinite set the same way as finite sets. Another German mathematician Gottlob

Frege, at the turn of the century, presented the set theory as principles of logic.
Till then the entire set theory was based on the assumption of the existence of the

set of all sets. It was the famous Englih Philosopher Bertand Russell (1872-
1970 )  who showed in 1902 that the assumption of existence of a set of all sets

leads to a contradiction. This led to the famous Russell’s Paradox. Paul R.Halmos
writes about it in his book ‘Naïve  Set Theory’ that “nothing contains everything”.

The Russell’s Paradox was not the only one which arose in set theory.
Many paradoxes were produced later by several mathematicians and logicians.

As a consequence of all these paradoxes, the first axiomatisation of set theory
was published in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo. Another one was proposed by Abraham

Fraenkel in 1922.  John Von Neumann in 1925  introduced explicitly the axiom of
regularity. Later in 1937 Paul Bernays gave a set of more satisfactory

axiomatisation. A modification of these axioms was done by Kurt Gödel in his
monograph in 1940. This was known as Von Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Gödel-

Bernays (GB) set theory.
Despite all these difficulties, Cantor’s set theory is used in present day

mathematics. In fact, these days most of the concepts and results in mathematics
are expressed in the set theoretic language.

RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS

vMathematics is the indispensable instrument of
all physical research. – BERTHELOT v

2.1  Introduction

Much of mathematics is about finding a pattern – a
recognisable link between quantities that change. In our
daily life, we come across many patterns that characterise
relations such as brother and sister, father and son, teacher
and student. In mathematics also, we come across many
relations such as number m is less than number n, line l is
parallel to line m, set A is a subset of set B. In all these, we
notice that a relation involves pairs of objects in certain
order. In this Chapter, we will learn how to link pairs of
objects from two sets and then introduce relations between
the two objects in the pair. Finally, we will learn about G . W.  Leibnitz
special relations which will qualify to be functions. The (1646–1716)

concept of function is very important in mathematics since it captures the idea of a
mathematically precise correspondence between one quantity with the other.

2.2  Cartesian Products of Sets

Suppose A is a set of 2 colours and B is a set of  3 objects, i.e.,
A = {red, blue}and B = {b, c, s},

where b, c and s represent a particular bag, coat and shirt, respectively.

How many pairs of coloured objects can be made from these two sets?

Proceeding in a very orderly manner, we can see that there will be 6
distinct pairs as given below:

(red, b), (red, c), (red, s), (blue, b), (blue, c), (blue, s).

Thus, we get 6 distinct objects (Fig 2.1).

Let us recall from our earlier classes that an ordered pair of elements Fig 2.1
taken from any two sets P and Q is a pair of elements written in small

RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS          25

brackets and grouped together in a particular order, i.e., (p,q), p ∈ P and  q ∈ Q . This
leads to the following definition:

Definition 1 Given two non-empty sets P and Q. The cartesian product P × Q is the
set of all ordered pairs of elements from P and Q, i.e.,

P × Q = { (p,q) : p  ∈ P, q  ∈ Q }
If either P or Q is the null set, then P × Q will also be empty set, i.e., P × Q = φ

From the illustration given above we note that
A × B = {(red,b), (red,c), (red,s), (blue,b), (blue,c), (blue,s)}.
Again, consider the two sets:

A = {DL, MP, KA}, where DL, MP, KA represent Delhi,
03

Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively and B = {01,02,
03}representing codes for the licence plates of vehicles issued 02

by DL, MP and KA . 01
If the three states, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka

were making codes for the licence plates of vehicles, with the DL MP KA

restriction that the code begins with an element from set A,
Fig 2.2

which are the pairs available from these sets and how many such
pairs will there be (Fig 2.2)?

The available pairs are:(DL,01), (DL,02), (DL,03), (MP,01), (MP,02), (MP,03),
(KA,01), (KA,02), (KA,03) and the product of set A and set B is given by
A × B = {(DL,01), (DL,02), (DL,03), (MP,01), (MP,02), (MP,03), (KA,01), (KA,02),

     (KA,03)}.
It can easily be seen that there will be 9 such pairs in the Cartesian product, since

there are 3 elements in each of the sets A and B. This gives us 9 possible codes. Also
note that the order in which these elements are paired is crucial. For example, the code
(DL, 01) will not be the same as the code (01, DL).

As a final illustration, consider the two sets A= {a , a } and
1 2

B = {b , b , b , b } (Fig 2.3).
1 2 3 4

A × B = {( a , b ), (a , b ), (a , b ), (a , b ), (a , b ), (a , b ),

                   (a , b ), (a , b )}.

The 8 ordered pairs thus formed can represent the position of points in
the plane if A and B are subsets of the set of real numbers and it is
obvious that the point in the position (a , b ) will be distinct from the point

1 2 Fig 2.3
in the position (b , a ).

Remarks
(i) Two ordered pairs are equal, if and only if  the corresponding first elements

are equal and the second  elements are also equal.

(ii) If there are p elements in A and q elements in B, then there will be pq
elements in A × B, i.e.,  if n(A) = p and n(B) = q,  then n(A × B) = pq.

(iii) If A and B are non-empty sets and either A or B is an infinite set, then so is

A × B.

(iv) A × A × A = {(a, b, c) : a, b, c ∈ A}. Here (a, b, c) is called an ordered

triplet.

Example 1 If  (x + 1, y – 2) = (3,1), find the values of x and y.

Solution Since the ordered pairs are equal, the corresponding elements are equal.

Therefore x + 1 = 3  and y – 2 = 1.

Solving we get x = 2 and y = 3.

Example 2 If P = {a, b, c} and Q = {r}, form the sets P × Q and Q × P.
Are these two products equal?

Solution By the definition of the cartesian product,
P × Q =  {(a, r), (b, r), (c, r)} and Q × P =  {(r, a), (r, b), (r, c)}

Since, by the definition of equality of ordered pairs, the pair (a, r) is not equal to the pair
(r, a), we conclude that P × Q ≠ Q × P.
However, the number of elements in each set will be the same.

Example 3 Let A = {1,2,3}, B = {3,4} and C = {4,5,6}. Find
(i) A × (B ∩ C) (ii) (A × B) ∩ (A × C)

(iii) A × (B ∪ C) (iv) (A × B) ∪ (A × C)

Solution (i) By the definition of the intersection of two sets, (B ∩ C) = {4}.

Therefore, A × (B ∩ C) = {(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)}.

 (ii) Now (A × B) = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4)}
and   (A × C) = {(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)}

Therefore, (A × B) ∩ (A × C)  = {(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)}.

(iii) Since, (B ∪ C) = {3, 4, 5, 6}, we have
A × (B ∪ C) = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,3),
(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)}.

(iv) Using the sets A × B and A × C from part (ii) above, we obtain
(A × B) ∪ (A × C) = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6),
(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)}.

  (2,2,2)}.

Example 5 If R is the set of all real numbers, what do the cartesian products R × R

and R × R × R represent?

Solution The Cartesian product R × R represents the set R × R={(x, y) : x, y ∈ R}
which represents the coordinates of all the points in two dimensional space and the
cartesian product R × R × R represents the set R × R × R ={(x, y, z) : x, y, z ∈ R}
which  represents the coordinates of all the points in three-dimensional space.

2.3  Relations
Consider the two sets P = {a, b, c} and Q = {Ali, Bhanu, Binoy, Chandra, Divya}.
The cartesian product of
P and Q has 15 ordered pairs which
can be listed as P × Q = {(a, Ali),
(a,Bhanu), (a, Binoy), ..., (c, Divya)}.

We can now obtain a subset of
P × Q by introducing a relation R
between the first element x and the
second element y of each ordered pair Fig 2.4

(x, y) as
R= { (x,y): x is the first letter of the name y, x ∈ P, y ∈ Q}.

Then R = {(a, Ali), (b, Bhanu), (b, Binoy), (c, Chandra)}
A visual representation of this relation R (called an arrow diagram) is shown
in Fig 2.4.

Definition 2 A relation R from a non-empty set A to a non-empty set B is a subset of
the cartesian product  A × B. The subset is derived by describing a relationship between
the first element and the second element of the ordered pairs in A × B. The second
element is called the image of  the first element.

Definition 3 The set of all first elements of the ordered pairs in a relation R from a set
A to a set B is called the domain of the relation R.

Definition 4 The set of all second elements in a relation R from a set A to a set B is
called the range of the relation R. The whole set B is called the codomain of the

relation R. Note that range ⊂ codomain.

Remarks (i) A relation may be represented algebraically either by the Roster
method or by the Set-builder method.

(ii) An arrow diagram is a visual representation of a relation.

The corresponding arrow diagram is
shown in Fig 2.5.

(ii) We can see that the
domain ={1, 2, 3, 4, 5,}

Similarly, the range = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
and the codomain = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Fig 2.5
Example 8 The Fig 2.6 shows a relation
between the sets P and Q. Write this relation (i) in set-builder form, (ii) in roster form.
What is its domain and range?

Solution It is obvious that the relation R is

(i) In set-builder form, R = {(x, y): x

 is the square of y, x ∈ P, y ∈ Q}
(ii) In roster form, R = {(9, 3),

(9, –3), (4, 2), (4, –2), (25, 5), (25, –5)} Fig 2.6

The domain of this relation is {4, 9, 25}.

The range of this relation is {– 2, 2, –3, 3, –5, 5}.

Note that the element 1 is not related to any element in set P.

The set Q is the codomain of this relation.

ANote  The total number of relations that can be defined from a set A to a set B
is the number of  possible subsets of A × B. If n(A ) =  p and n(B) = q, then
n (A × B) = pq and the total number of relations is 2pq.

Example 9 Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. Find the number of relations from A to B.

Solution We have,
A × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.

Since n (A×B ) = 4, the number of subsets of A×B is 24. Therefore, the number of
relations from A into B will be 24.

Remark  A relation R from A to A is also stated as a relation on A.

2.4 Functions
In this Section, we study a special type of relation called function. It is one of the most
important concepts in mathematics. We can, visualise a function as a rule, which produces
new elements out of some given elements.  There are many terms such as ‘map’ or
‘mapping’ used to denote a function.

Definition 5 A relation f from a set A to a set B is said to be a function if every
element of set A has one and only one image in set B.

In other words, a function f is a relation from a non-empty set A to a non-empty
set B such that the domain of f is A and no two distinct ordered pairs in f  have the
same first element.

If f is a function from A to B and (a, b) ∈ f, then f (a) = b, where b is called the
image of a under f and a is called the preimage of b under f.

Reprint 2025-26



RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS          31

The function f from A to B is denoted by f: A à B.
Looking at the previous examples, we can easily see that the relation in Example 7 is
not a function because the element 6 has no image.

Again, the relation in Example 8 is not a function because the elements in the
domain are connected to more than one images. Similarly, the relation in  Example 9 is
also not a function. (Why?) In the examples given below, we will see many more
relations some of which are functions and others are not.

Example 10 Let N be the set of natural numbers and the relation R be defined on
N such that  R = {(x, y) : y = 2x, x, y ∈ N}.

What is the domain, codomain and range of R? Is this relation a function?

Solution The domain of R is the set of natural numbers N. The codomain is also N.
The range is the set of even natural numbers.

Since every natural number n has one and only one image, this relation is a
function.

Example 11 Examine each of the following relations given below and state in each
case, giving reasons whether it is a function or not?

(i) R = {(2,1),(3,1), (4,2)}, (ii) R = {(2,2),(2,4),(3,3), (4,4)}
(iii) R = {(1,2),(2,3),(3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7)}

Solution (i) Since 2, 3, 4 are the elements of domain of R having their unique images,
this relation R is a function.

(ii) Since the same first element 2 corresponds to two different images 2
and 4, this relation is not a function.

(iii) Since every element has one and only one image, this relation is a
function.

Definition 6 A function which has either R or one of its subsets as its range is called
a real valued function. Further, if its domain is also either R or a subset of R, it is
called a real function.

Example 12 Let N be the set of natural numbers.  Define a real valued function

2.4.2   Algebra of real functions  In this Section, we shall learn how to add two real
functions, subtract a real function from another, multiply a real function by a scalar
(here by a scalar we mean a real number), multiply two real functions and divide one
real function by another.

(i) Addition of two real functions  Let f : X → R and g : X → R be any two real
functions, where X ⊂ R. Then, we define (f + g): X → R by

(f + g) (x) = f (x) + g (x), for all x ∈ X.

(ii) Subtraction of a real function from another Let f : X → R and g: X → R be
any two real functions, where X ⊂ R. Then, we define (f – g) : X→R by
(f–g) (x) = f(x) –g(x), for all x ∈ X.

(iii) Multiplication by a scalar Let f : X→R be a real valued function and α be a
scalar. Here by scalar, we mean a real number. Then the product α f is a function from
X to R defined by (α f ) (x) =  α f (x), x ∈X.

(iv) Multiplication of two real functions The product (or multiplication) of two real
functions f:X→R and g:X→R is a function fg:X→R defined by
(fg) (x) = f(x) g(x), for all x ∈ X.
This is also called pointwise multiplication.

a – b ∈ Z}. Show that

(i) (a,a) ∈ R for all a ∈ Q
(ii) (a,b) ∈ R implies that (b, a) ∈ R
(iii) (a,b) ∈ R and (b,c) ∈ R implies that (a,c) ∈R

Solution (i) Since, a – a = 0 ∈ Z, if follows that (a, a) ∈ R.
(ii) (a,b) ∈ R implies that a – b ∈ Z. So, b – a ∈ Z. Therefore,

(b, a) ∈ R
(iii) (a, b) and (b, c)  ∈ R implies that a – b ∈ Z. b – c ∈ Z.  So,

      a – c = (a – b) + (b – c) ∈ Z. Therefore, (a,c) ∈ R

Example 20  Let f = {(1,1), (2,3), (0, –1), (–1, –3)} be a linear function from Z into Z.
Find f(x).

Solution Since f is a linear function, f (x) = mx + c. Also, since (1, 1), (0, – 1) ∈ R,
f (1) = m + c = 1 and f (0) = c = –1. This gives m = 2 and f(x) = 2x – 1.

Solution  Since x  –5x + 4 = (x – 4) (x –1), the function f is defined for all real numbers
except at x = 4 and x = 1. Hence the domain of f is R – {1, 4}.

Draw the graph of f (x).

Solution Here,  f(x) = 1 – x, x < 0, this gives

f(– 4) = 1 – (– 4) = 5;

f(– 3) =1 – (– 3) = 4,

f(– 2) = 1 – (– 2) = 3

and f(1) = 2, f (2) = 3, f (3) = 4

f(4) = 5 and so on for  f(x) = x + 1, x > 0.

Summary

In this Chapter, we studied about relations and functions.The main features of

this Chapter are as follows:

® Ordered pair  A pair of elements grouped together in a particular order.

® Cartesian product A × B of two sets A and B is given by

A × B =  {(a, b): a ∈ A, b ∈ B}

In particular R × R = {(x, y): x, y ∈ R}

and R × R × R = {(x, y, z): x, y, z ∈ R}

® If (a, b) = (x, y), then a = x and b = y.

® If n(A) = p and n(B) = q, then n(A × B) = pq.

® A × φ = φ
® In general, A × B ≠ B × A.

® Relation A relation R from a set A to a set B is a subset of the cartesian
product A × B obtained by describing a relationship between the first element
x and the second element y of the ordered pairs in A × B.

® The image of an element x under a relation R is given by y, where (x, y) ∈ R,

® The domain of R is the set of all first elements of the ordered pairs in a
relation R.

® The range of the relation R is the set of all second elements of the ordered
pairs in a relation R.

® Function A function f from a set A to a set B is a specific type of relation for
which every element x of set A has one and only one image y in set B.

We write f: A→B, where f(x) = y.

® A is the domain and B is the codomain of f.

Historical Note

The word FUNCTION first appears in a Latin manuscript “Methodus
tangentium inversa, seu de fuctionibus” written by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz
(1646-1716) in 1673; Leibnitz used the word in the non-analytical sense. He
considered a function in terms of “mathematical job” – the “employee” being
just a curve.

On July 5, 1698, Johan Bernoulli, in a letter to Leibnitz, for the first time
deliberately  assigned a specialised use of the term function in the analytical
sense. At the end of that month, Leibnitz replied showing his approval.

Function is found in English in 1779 in Chambers’ Cyclopaedia: “The
term function is used in algebra, for an analytical expression any way compounded
of a variable quantity, and of numbers, or constant quantities”.

TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS

vA mathematician knows how to solve a problem,

3.1  Introduction

The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words
‘trigon’ and ‘metron’ and it means ‘measuring the sides of
a triangle’. The subject was originally developed to solve
geometric problems involving triangles. It was studied by
sea captains for navigation, surveyor to map out the new
lands, by engineers and others. Currently, trigonometry is
used in many areas such as the science of seismology,
designing electric circuits, describing the state of an atom,
predicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analysing a
musical tone and in many other areas.

In earlier classes, we have studied the trigonometric Arya Bhatt
ratios of acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right  (476-550)

angled triangle. We have also studied the trigonometric identities and application of
trigonometric ratios in solving the problems related to heights and distances. In this
Chapter, we will generalise the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions
and study their properties.

3.2  Angles

Angle is a measure of rotation of a given ray about its initial point. The original ray is

Vertex

Reprint 2025-26



44 MATHEMATICS

called the initial side and the final position of the ray after rotation is called the
terminal side of the angle. The point of rotation is called the vertex. If the direction of
rotation is anticlockwise, the angle is said to be positive and if the direction of rotation
is clockwise, then the angle is negative (Fig 3.1).

The measure of an angle is the amount of
rotation performed to get the terminal side from
the initial side. There are several units for
measuring angles. The definition of an angle Fig  3.2

suggests a unit, viz. one complete revolution from the position of the initial side as
indicated in Fig 3.2.

This is often convenient for large angles. For example, we can say that a rapidly
spinning wheel is making an angle of say 15 revolution per second. We shall  describe
two other units of measurement of an angle which are most commonly used, viz.
degree measure and radian measure.

th
 1 

3.2.1  Degree measure  If a rotation from the initial side to terminal side is   of
 360 

a revolution, the angle is said to have a measure of one degree, written as 1°.  A degree is
divided into 60 minutes, and a minute is divided into 60 seconds . One sixtieth of a degree is
called a minute, written as 1′, and one sixtieth of a minute is called a second, written as 1″.
Thus, 1° = 60′, 1′ = 60″

Some of the angles whose measures are 360°,180°, 270°, 420°, – 30°, – 420° are
shown in Fig 3.3.

3.2.2  Radian measure  There is another unit for measurement of an angle, called
the radian measure. Angle subtended at the centre by an arc of length 1 unit in a
unit circle (circle of radius 1 unit) is said to have a measure of 1 radian. In the Fig
3.4(i) to (iv), OA is the initial side and OB is the terminal side. The figures show the

angles whose measures are 1 radian, –1 radian, 1  radian and –1  radian.

Fig  3.4 (i) to (iv)

We know that the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit is 2π. Thus, one
complete revolution of the initial side subtends an angle of  2π radian.

More generally, in a circle of radius r, an arc of length r will subtend an angle of

1 radian. It is well-known that equal arcs of a circle subtend equal angle at the centre.

Since in a circle of radius r, an arc of length r subtends an angle whose measure is 1

radian, an arc of length l will subtend an angle whose measure is  radian. Thus, if in

3.2.3  Relation between radian and real numbers

2
Consider the unit circle with centre O. Let A be any point
on the circle. Consider OA as initial side of an angle.

Then the length  of an arc of the circle will give the radian 1
measure of the angle which the arc will subtend at the

centre of the circle. Consider the line PAQ which is
1 A

tangent to the circle at A. Let the point A represent the 0
O

real number zero, AP represents positive real number and
AQ represents negative real numbers (Fig 3.5). If we

−1
rope the line AP in the anticlockwise direction along the
circle, and AQ in the clockwise direction, then every real

number will correspond to a radian measure and −2
conversely. Thus, radian measures and real numbers can Fig  3.5 Q
be considered as one and the same.

3.2.4   Relation between degree and radian   Since a circle subtends at the centre
an angle whose radian measure is 2π and its degree measure is 360°, it follows that

2π radian = 360°   or π radian = 180°

The above relation enables us to express a radian measure in terms of degree

measure and a degree measure in terms of radian measure. Using approximate value

Notational Convention
Since angles are measured either in degrees or in radians, we adopt the convention
that whenever we write angle θ°, we mean the angle whose degree measure is θ and
whenever we write angle β, we mean the angle whose radian measure is β.

Note that when an angle is expressed in radians, the word ‘radian’ is frequently

π π
omitted. Thus, π =180° and = 45°  are written with the understanding that π and

are radian measures. Thus, we can say that

3.3  Trigonometric Functions

In earlier classes, we have studied trigonometric ratios for acute angles as the ratio of
sides of a right angled triangle. We will now extend the definition of trigonometric
ratios to any angle in terms of radian measure and study them as trigonometric functions.

Consider a unit circle with centre
at origin of the coordinate axes. Let
P (a, b) be any point on the circle with
angle AOP = x radian, i.e., length of arc
AP = x (Fig 3.6).

We define cos x = a and sin x =  b
Since ∆OMP is a right triangle, we have

OM2 + MP2 = OP2 or a2 + b2 = 1
Thus, for every point on the unit circle,
we have

a2 + b2 = 1 or cos2 x + sin2 x = 1
Since one complete revolution

subtends an angle of 2π radian at the

π
centre of the circle,  ∠AOB = , Fig  3.6

∠AOC = π and  ∠AOD = . All angles which are integral multiples of  are called

2 2
quadrantal angles. The coordinates of the points A, B, C and D are, respectively,
(1, 0), (0, 1), (–1, 0) and (0, –1). Therefore, for quadrantal angles, we have

Now, if we take one complete revolution from the point P, we again come back to
same point P. Thus, we also observe that if x increases (or decreases) by any integral
multiple of 2π, the values of sine and cosine functions do not change. Thus,

sin (2nπ + x)  = sin x , n ∈ Z ,  cos (2nπ + x) = cosx , n ∈ Z
Further, sin x = 0, if x  = 0, ± π,  ± 2π , ± 3π, ..., i.e., when x is an integral multiple of π

and cos x = 0, if x  = ± , ±  , ± , ... i.e., cos x vanishes when x is an odd

We have shown that for all real x,  sin2 x + cos2 x = 1

It follows that

1 + tan2 x = sec2 x (why?)

1 + cot2 x = cosec2 x (why?)

In earlier classes, we have discussed the values of trigonometric ratios for 0°,
30°, 45°, 60° and 90°. The values of trigonometric functions for these angles are same
as that of trigonometric ratios studied in earlier classes. Thus, we have the following
table:

The values of cosec x, sec x and cot x
are the reciprocal of the values of sin x,

cos x and tan x, respectively.

3.3.1  Sign of trigonometric functions

Let P (a, b) be a point on the unit circle
with centre at the origin such that

∠AOP = x. If ∠AOQ = – x, then the
coordinates of the point Q will be (a, –b)

(Fig 3.7). Therefore

cos (– x) = cos x

and sin (– x) = – sin x

Since for every point P (a, b) on

the unit circle, – 1 ≤  a ≤ 1 and Fig  3.7

– 1 ≤  b ≤ 1, we have – 1 ≤ cos x ≤ 1 and –1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1 for all x. We   have learnt in

π

2

3π 3π
(π < x < ) a and b are both negative and in the fourth quadrant (  < x < 2π) a is

2 2
positive and b is negative. Therefore, sin x is positive for 0 < x < π, and negative for

π π 3π
π < x < 2π. Similarly, cos x is positive for 0 < x < , negative for  <  x <  and also

2 2 2

3π
positive for <  x < 2π. Likewise, we can find the signs of other trigonometric

functions in different quadrants. In fact, we have the following table.

3.3.2  Domain and range of trigonometric functions  From the definition of sine
and cosine functions, we observe that they are defined for all real numbers. Further,
we observe that for each real number x,

 – 1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1 and  – 1 ≤ cos x ≤ 1

Thus, domain of y = sin x and y = cos x is the set of all real numbers and range

is the interval [–1, 1], i.e., – 1 ≤ y ≤ 1.

Since cosec x = , the domain of y = cosec x is the set { x : x ∈ R and

sin x
x ≠ n π, n ∈ Z} and range is the set {y : y ∈ R, y  ≥ 1 or y  ≤ – 1}. Similarly, the domain

π
of y = sec x is the set {x : x ∈ R and x ≠ (2n + 1) , n ∈ Z} and range is the set

2
{y : y  ∈ R, y  ≤ – 1or y ≥ 1}. The domain of y = tan x is the set {x : x ∈ R and

π
x ≠ (2n + 1) , n ∈ Z} and range is the set of all real numbers. The domain of

2
y = cot x is the set {x : x  ∈ R and x ≠ n π, n ∈ Z} and the range is the set of all real
numbers.

π
We further observe that in the first quadrant, as x increases from 0 to , sin x

2
π

increases from 0 to 1, as x increases from  to π, sin x decreases from 1 to 0. In the
2

3π
third quadrant, as x increases from π to , sin x decreases from 0 to –1and finally, in

2
3π

the fourth quadrant, sin x increases from –1 to 0 as x increases from  to 2π.

Similarly, we can discuss the behaviour of other trigonometric functions. In fact, we
have the following table:

I quadrant II quadrant III quadrant IV quadrant

sin increases from 0 to 1 decreases from 1 to 0 decreases from 0 to –1 increases from –1 to 0

cos decreases from 1 to 0 decreases from 0 to – 1 increases from –1 to 0 increases from 0 to 1

tan increases from 0 to ∞ increases from –∞to 0 increases from 0 to ∞ increases from –∞to 0

cot decreases from ∞ to 0 decreases from 0 to–∞ decreases from ∞ to 0 decreases from 0to –∞

sec increases from 1 to ∞ increases from –∞to–1 decreases from –1to–∞ decreases from ∞ to 1

cosec decreases from ∞ to 1 increases from 1 to ∞ increases from –∞to–1 decreases from–1to–∞

Remark In the above table, the statement tan x increases from 0 to ∞ (infinity) for

π π
0 < x <  simply means that tan x increases as x increases for 0 < x <  and

2
cosec x decreases from –1 to – ∞ (minus infinity) in the fourth quadrant means that

3π
cosec x decreases for x ∈ ( , 2π) and assumes arbitrarily large negative values as

2
x approaches to 2π. The symbols ∞ and  – ∞ simply specify certain types of behaviour

of functions and variables.

We have already seen that values of sin x and cos x repeats after an interval of

2π. Hence, values of cosec x and sec x will also repeat after an interval of 2π. We

after an interval of π. Since cot x is reciprocal of tan x, its values will also repeat after

an interval of π. Using this knowledge and behaviour of trigonometic functions, we can

sketch the graph of these functions. The graph of these functions are given above:

Historical Note

The study of trigonometry was first started in India. The ancient Indian
Mathematicians, Aryabhatta (476), Brahmagupta (598), Bhaskara I (600) and
Bhaskara II (1114) got important results. All this knowledge first went from
India to middle-east and from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the
study of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian
approach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world.

In India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as
the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents the main
contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to the history of
mathematics.

Bhaskara I (about 600) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions
for angles more than 90°. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa
(period) contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for
sines or cosines of 18°, 36° , 54°, 72° , etc., are given by
Bhaskara II.

The symbols sin–1 x, cos–1 x, etc., for arc sin x, arc cos x, etc., were
suggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The names of Thales
(about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He
is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by
measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known
height, and comparing the ratios:

H h
=  = tan (sun’s altitude)

S s

Thales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through
the proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance
using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.

Mathematics. – GAUSS v

4.1  Introduction

In earlier classes, we have studied linear equations in one
and two variables and quadratic equations in one variable.
We have seen that the equation x2 + 1 = 0 has no real
solution as x2 + 1 = 0 gives x2 = – 1 and square of every
real number is non-negative. So, we need to extend the
real number system to a larger system so that we can
find the solution of the equation x2 = – 1. In fact, the main
objective is to solve the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, where
D = b2 –  4ac < 0, which is not possible in the system of
real numbers.

W. R. Hamilton
4.2  Complex Numbers (1805-1865)

2
Let us denote −1  by the symbol i. Then, we have i = −1 . This means that i is a
solution of the equation x2 + 1 = 0.

A number of the form a + ib, where a and b are real numbers, is defined to be a

 −1
complex number. For example, 2 + i3,  (– 1) + i 3 ,  4 + i   are complex numbers.

 11 
For the complex number z = a + ib, a is called the real part, denoted by Re z and

b is called the imaginary part denoted by Im z of the complex number z. For example,
if z = 2 + i5, then Re z = 2 and Im z = 5.

Two complex numbers z  = a + ib and z  = c + id are equal if  a = c and b = d.

the values of x and y.

Solution We have
4x + i (3x – y) = 3 + i (–6) ... (1)

Equating the real and the imaginary parts of (1), we get
4x = 3, 3x – y = – 6,

4.3   Algebra of Complex Numbers
In this Section, we shall develop the algebra of complex numbers.

4.3.1   Addition of two complex numbers Let z  = a + ib and z  = c + id be any two
1 2

complex numbers. Then, the sum  z  + z  is defined as follows:
1 2

z  + z  = (a + c) + i (b + d), which is again a complex number.
1 2

For example, (2 + i3) + (– 6 +i5) = (2 – 6) + i (3 + 5) = – 4 + i 8

The addition of complex numbers satisfy the following properties:

(i) The closure law  The sum of two complex numbers is a complex
number, i.e., z  + z  is a complex number for all complex numbers

1 2

z  and z .
1 2

(ii) The commutative law  For any two complex numbers z  and z ,
1 2

z  + z  = z  + z
1 2 2 1

(iii) The associative law  For any three complex numbers z , z , z ,
1 2 3

(z  + z ) + z  = z  + (z  + z ).
1 2 3 1 2 3

(iv) The existence of additive identity  There exists the complex number
0 + i 0 (denoted as 0), called the additive identity or the zero complex
number, such that, for every complex number z, z + 0 = z.

(v) The existence of additive inverse  To every complex number
z = a + ib, we have the complex number – a + i(– b) (denoted as –  z),
called the additive inverse or negative of z. We observe that z + (–z) = 0
(the additive identity).

4.3.2  Difference of two complex numbers Given any two complex numbers z  and
1

z , the difference z  – z  is defined as follows:
2 1 2

z  – z  = z  + (– z ).
1 2 1 2

For example, (6 + 3i) – (2 – i) = (6 + 3i) + (– 2 + i ) = 4 + 4i

and (2 –  i) – (6 + 3i) = (2 – i) + ( – 6 – 3i) = – 4 – 4i

4.3.3  Multiplication of two complex numbers Let z  = a + ib and z  = c + id be any
1 2

two complex numbers. Then, the product z  z  is defined as follows:
1 2

z  z  = (ac –  bd) + i(ad + bc)
1 2

For example, (3 + i5) (2 + i6) = (3 × 2 – 5 × 6) + i(3 × 6 + 5 × 2) = – 24 + i28
The multiplication of complex numbers possesses the following properties, which

we state without proofs.
(i) The closure law The product of two complex numbers is a complex number,

the product z  z  is a complex number for all complex numbers z  and z .
1 2 1 2

(ii) The commutative law For any two complex numbers z  and z ,

z  z  = z  z .

(iii) The associative law For any three complex numbers z , z , z ,
1 2 3

(z  z ) z  = z  (z  z ).
1 2 3 1 2 3

(iv) The existence of multiplicative identity There exists the complex number
1 + i 0 (denoted as 1),  called the multiplicative identity such that z.1 = z,
for every complex number z.

(v) The existence of multiplicative inverse For every non-zero complex
number z = a + ib or a + bi(a ≠ 0, b ≠ 0), we have the complex number

a –b 1

4.3.6  The square roots of a negative real number

Note that  i2 = –1 and  ( – i)2 = i2 = – 1

Therefore,  the square roots of – 1 are i, – i. However, by the symbol −1 , we would

mean i only.
Now, we can see that i and –i both are the solutions of the equation x2 + 1 = 0 or

x2 = –1.

2
Similarly ( 2

3 i) = ( 3)  i2 = 3 (– 1) = – 3

( )2− 3 i  = ( )2− 3  i2 = – 3

Therefore,  the square roots of –3 are 3 i  and − 3 i .

Again, the symbol −3  is meant to represent 3 i  only, i.e., −3  = 3 i .

Generally, if a is a positive real number, −a  = a −1  = a i ,

We already know that a× b  = ab  for all positive real number a and b. This

result also holds true when either a > 0, b < 0  or a < 0,  b > 0. What if a < 0, b < 0?

Let us examine.

i = −1 −1 = (−1) (−1)  (by assuming a × b  = ab  for all real numbers)

= 1  = 1,  which is a contradiction to the fact that i = −1.

Therefore, a × b ≠ ab  if both a and b are negative real numbers.

Further, if any of a and b is zero, then, clearly, a × b = ab = 0.

4.4  The Modulus and the Conjugate of a Complex Number

Let z = a + ib be a complex number. Then, the modulus of z, denoted by | z |, is defined

to be the  non-negative real number a2 + b2 , i.e., | z | = 2 + 2
a b  and the conjugate

of z, denoted as z , is the complex number a –  ib, i.e.,  z  = a –  ib.

For example, + 2 2
3 i = 3 +1 = 10 ,  − 2 2

2 5i = 2 + ( −5) = 29 ,

and 3+ i = 3− i ,  2 −5 i = 2 + 5 i , −3i − 5  = 3i – 5

Observe that the multiplicative inverse of the non-zero complex number z is
given by

4.5  Argand Plane and Polar Representation

We already know that corresponding to

each ordered pair of real numbers

(x, y), we get a unique point in the XY-

plane and vice-versa with reference to a

set of mutually perpendicular lines known

as the x-axis and the y-axis. The complex

number x + iy which  corresponds to the

ordered pair (x, y) can be represented

geometrically as the unique point P(x, y)

in the XY-plane and vice-versa.

Some complex numbers such as

2 + 4i, – 2 + 3i, 0 + 1i, 2 + 0i, – 5 –2i and
Fig 4.1

1 – 2i which correspond to the ordered

pairs (2, 4), ( – 2, 3), (0, 1), (2, 0), ( –5, –2), and (1, – 2), respectively, have been

represented geometrically by the points A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively in

the Fig 4.1.

The plane having a complex number assigned to each of its point is called the

complex plane or the Argand plane.

Reprint 2025-26



84       MATHEMATICS

Obviously, in the Argand plane, the modulus of the complex number

x + iy = x2 + y2  is the distance between the point P(x, y) and the origin O (0, 0)

(Fig 4.2). The points on the x-axis corresponds to the complex numbers of the form
a + i 0 and the points on the y-axis corresponds to the complex numbers of the form

Fig 4.2

0 + i b. The x-axis and y-axis in the Argand plane are called, respectively, the real axis
and the imaginary axis.

The representation of a  complex number z = x + iy and its conjugate
z = x – iy in the Argand plane are, respectively, the points P (x, y) and Q (x, – y).

Geometrically, the point (x, – y) is the mirror image of the point (x, y) on the real
axis (Fig 4.3).

Historical Note

The fact that square root of a negative number does not exist in the real number
system was recognised by the Greeks. But the credit goes to the Indian
mathematician Mahavira (850) who first stated this difficulty clearly. “He
mentions in his work ‘Ganitasara Sangraha’ as in the nature of things a negative
(quantity) is not a square (quantity)’,  it has, therefore, no square root”.
Bhaskara, another Indian mathematician, also writes in his work Bijaganita,
written in 1150. “There is no square root of a negative quantity, for it is not a
square.” Cardan (1545) considered the problem of solving

x + y = 10, xy = 40.

Reprint 2025-26



88       MATHEMATICS

He obtained x = 5 + −15  and y = 5 – −15  as the solution of it, which

was discarded by him by saying that these numbers are ‘useless’.  Albert
Girard (about 1625) accepted square root of negative numbers and said that
this will enable us to get as many roots as the degree of the polynomial equation.

Euler was the first to introduce the symbol i for −1  and W.R. Hamilton

(about 1830) regarded the complex number a + ib as an ordered pair of real
numbers (a, b) thus giving it a purely mathematical definition and avoiding use
of the so called ‘imaginary numbers’.

LINEAR INEQUALITIES

vMathematics is the art of saying many things in many
different ways. – MAXWELLv

5.1  Introduction

In earlier classes, we have studied equations in one variable and two variables and also
solved some statement problems by translating them in the form of equations. Now a
natural question arises: ‘Is it always possible to translate a statement problem in the
form of an equation? For example, the height of all the students in your class is less
than 160 cm. Your classroom can occupy atmost 60 tables or chairs or both. Here we
get certain statements involving a sign ‘<’ (less than), ‘>’ (greater than), ‘≤’ (less than
or equal) and ≥ (greater than or equal) which are known as inequalities.

In this Chapter, we will study linear inequalities in one and two variables. The
study of inequalities is very useful in solving problems in the field of science, mathematics,
statistics, economics, psychology, etc.

5.2 Inequalities

Let us consider the following situations:

(i) Ravi goes to market with ̀  200 to buy rice, which is available in packets of 1kg. The
price of one packet of rice is ̀  30. If x denotes the number of packets of rice, which he
buys, then the total amount spent by him is ` 30x. Since, he has to buy rice in packets
only, he may not be able to spend the entire amount of ` 200. (Why?) Hence

30x < 200 ... (1)

Clearly the statement (i) is not an equation as it does not involve the sign of equality.

(ii) Reshma has ` 120 and wants to buy some registers and pens. The cost of one
register is  ` 40 and that of a pen is ` 20. In this case, if x denotes the number of
registers and y, the number of pens which Reshma buys, then the total amount spent by
her is ` (40x  +  20y) and we have

40x + 20y ≤ 120 ... (2)

Reprint 2025-26



90       MATHEMATICS

Since in this case the total amount spent may be upto ̀  120. Note that the statement (2)
consists of two statements

40x + 20y < 120 ... (3)
and 40x + 20y = 120 ... (4)

Statement (3) is not an equation, i.e., it is an inequality while statement (4) is an equation.

Definition 1 Two real numbers or two algebraic expressions related by the symbol
‘<’, ‘>’, ‘≤’ or ‘≥’ form an inequality.

Statements such as (1), (2) and (3) above are inequalities.

3 < 5;  7 > 5 are the examples of numerical inequalities while

 x < 5; y > 2; x  ≥  3,  y ≤  4 are some examples of  literal inequalities.

3 < 5 < 7 (read as 5 is greater than 3 and less than 7), 3 <  x < 5 (read as x is greater
than or equal to 3 and less than 5) and 2 < y < 4 are the examples of double inequalities.

Some more examples of inequalities are:

ax + b < 0 ... (5)

ax + b > 0 ... (6)

ax + b ≤ 0 ... (7)

ax + b ≥ 0 ... (8)

ax + by < c ... (9)

ax + by > c ... (10)

ax + by ≤ c ... (11)

ax + by ≥  c ... (12)

ax2 + bx + c ≤ 0 ... (13)

ax2 + bx + c > 0 ... (14)

Inequalities (5), (6), (9), (10) and (14) are strict inequalities while inequalities (7), (8),
(11), (12), and (13) are slack inequalities. Inequalities from (5) to (8) are linear
inequalities in one variable x when a ≠ 0, while inequalities from (9) to (12) are linear
inequalities in two variables x and y when a ≠ 0, b ≠ 0.

Inequalities (13) and (14) are not linear (in fact, these are quadratic inequalities
in one variable x when a ≠ 0).

In this Chapter, we shall confine ourselves to the study of linear inequalities in one
and two variables only.

5.3 Algebraic Solutions of Linear Inequalities in One Variable and their
Graphical Representation

Let us consider the inequality (1) of Section 6.2, viz, 30x < 200
Note that here x denotes the number of packets of rice.

Obviously, x cannot be a negative integer or a fraction. Left hand side (L.H.S.) of this
inequality is 30x and right hand side (RHS) is 200. Therefore, we have

For x = 0, L.H.S. = 30 (0) = 0 < 200 (R.H.S.), which is true.

For x = 1, L.H.S. = 30 (1) = 30 < 200 (R.H.S.), which is true.

For x = 2, L.H.S. = 30 (2) = 60 < 200, which is true.

For x = 3, L.H.S. = 30 (3) = 90 < 200, which is true.

For x = 4, L.H.S. = 30 (4) = 120 < 200, which is true.

For x = 5, L.H.S. = 30 (5) = 150 < 200, which is true.

For x = 6, L.H.S. = 30 (6) = 180 < 200, which is true.

For x = 7, L.H.S. = 30 (7) = 210 < 200, which is false.

In the above situation, we find that the values of x, which makes the above
inequality a true statement, are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. These values of x, which make above
inequality a true statement, are called solutions of inequality and the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
is called its solution set.
Thus, any solution of an inequality in one variable is a value of the variable
which makes it a true statement.

We have found the solutions of the above inequality by trial and error method
which is not very efficient. Obviously, this method is time consuming and sometimes
not feasible. We must have some better or systematic techniques for solving inequalities.
Before that we should go through some more properties of numerical inequalities and
follow them as rules while solving the inequalities.

You will recall that while solving linear equations, we followed the following rules:

Rule 1 Equal numbers may be added to (or subtracted from) both sides of an equation.

Rule 2 Both sides of an equation may be multiplied (or divided) by the same non-zero
number.

In the case of solving inequalities, we again follow the same rules except with a
difference that in Rule 2, the sign of inequality is reversed (i.e., ‘<‘ becomes ‘>’, ≤’
becomes ‘≥’ and so on) whenever we multiply (or divide) both sides of an inequality by
a negative number. It is evident from the facts that

3 > 2 while – 3 < – 2,
– 8 < – 7 while (– 8) (– 2) > (– 7) (– 2) , i.e., 16 > 14.

Reprint 2025-26



92       MATHEMATICS

Thus, we state the following rules for solving an inequality:

Rule 1 Equal numbers may be added to (or subtracted from) both sides of an inequality
without affecting the sign of inequality.

Rule 2  Both sides of an inequality can be multiplied (or divided) by the same positive
number. But when both sides are multiplied or divided by a negative number, then the
sign of inequality is reversed.

Now, let us consider some examples.

Example 1 Solve 30 x < 200 when

(i) x is a natural number, (ii) x is an integer.

Solution We are given  30 x < 200

30x 200

(i) When x is a natural number, in this case the following values of x make the

statement true.
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

The solution set of the inequality is {1,2,3,4,5,6}.
(ii) When x is an integer, the solutions of the given inequality are

..., – 3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
The solution set of the inequality is {...,–3, –2,–1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Example 2 Solve 5x – 3 < 3x +1 when

(i) x is an integer, (ii) x is a real number.
Solution We have, 5x –3 < 3x + 1

or 5x –3 + 3 < 3x +1 +3 (Rule 1)
or 5x < 3x +4
or 5x – 3x < 3x + 4 – 3x (Rule 1)
or 2x < 4
or x < 2 (Rule 2)

(i) When x is an integer, the solutions of the given inequality are
..., – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1

(ii) When x is a real number, the solutions of the inequality are given by x < 2,
i.e., all real numbers x which are less than 2. Therefore, the solution set of
the inequality is  x ∈ (– ∞, 2).

We have considered solutions of inequalities in the set of natural numbers, set of
integers and in the set of real numbers. Henceforth, unless stated otherwise, we shall
solve the inequalities in this Chapter in the set of real numbers.

or 110 + x ≥ 180

Thus, the student must obtain a minimum of 70 marks to get an average of at least

Example 8  Find all pairs of consecutive odd natural numbers, both of which are larger
than 10, such that their sum is less than 40.

Solution Let x be the smaller of the two consecutive odd natural number, so that the
other one is x +2. Then, we should have

x > 10 ... (1)

and x + ( x + 2) < 40 ... (2)

Solving  (2), we get

2x + 2 < 40

i.e., x < 19 ... (3)

From (1) and (3), we get

10 < x < 19

6.1  Introduction

Suppose you have a suitcase with a number lock. The number

lock has 4 wheels each labelled with 10 digits from 0 to 9.

The lock can be opened if 4 specific digits are arranged in a

particular sequence with no repetition. Some how, you have

forgotten this specific sequence of digits. You remember only

the first digit which is 7. In order to open  the lock, how

many sequences of 3-digits you may have to check with? To

answer this question, you may, immediately, start listing all

possible arrangements of  9 remaining digits taken 3 at a

time. But, this method will be tedious, because the number
Jacob Bernoulli

of possible sequences may be large. Here, in this Chapter, (1654-1705)
we shall learn some basic counting techniques which will

enable us to answer this question without actually listing 3-digit arrangements. In fact,

these techniques will be useful in determining the number of different ways of arranging

and selecting objects without actually listing them. As a first step, we shall examine a

principle which is most fundamental to the learning of these techniques.

6.2  Fundamental Principle of Counting

Let us consider the following problem. Mohan has 3 pants and 2 shirts. How many

different pairs of a pant and a shirt, can he dress up with? There are 3 ways in which

a pant can be chosen, because there are 3 pants available. Similarly, a shirt can be

chosen in 2 ways. For every choice of a pant, there are 2 choices of a shirt. Therefore,

there are 3 × 2 = 6 pairs of a pant and a shirt.

   PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS       101

Let us name the three pants as P , P , P   and the two shirts as S , S . Then,
1 2 3 1 2

these six possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.1.
Let us consider another problem

of the same type.
Sabnam has 2 school bags, 3 tiffin boxes
and 2 water bottles. In how many ways
can she carry these items (choosing one
each).

A school  bag can be chosen in 2
different ways. After a school bag is
chosen, a tiffin box can be chosen in 3
different ways. Hence, there are
2 × 3 = 6 pairs of school bag and a tiffin
box. For each of these pairs a water
bottle can be chosen in 2 different ways. Fig 6.1

Hence, there are 6 × 2 = 12 different ways in which, Sabnam can carry these items to
school. If we name the 2 school bags as B , B , the three tiffin boxes as T , T , T  and

1 2 1 2 3

the two water bottles as W , W , these possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.2.

102       MATHEMATICS

In fact, the problems of the above types are solved by applying the following
principle known as the fundamental principle of counting, or, simply, the multiplication
principle, which states that

“If an event can occur in m different ways, following which another event
can occur in n different ways, then the total number of occurrence of the events
in the given order is m×n.”

The above principle can be generalised for any finite number of events. For
example, for 3 events, the principle is as follows:

‘If an event can occur in m different ways, following which another event can
occur in n different ways, following which a third event can occur in p different ways,
then the total number of occurrence to ‘the events in the given order is m × n × p.”

In the first problem, the required number of ways of wearing a pant and a shirt
was the number of different ways of the occurence of the following events in succession:

(i) the event of choosing a pant
(ii) the event of choosing a shirt.

In the second problem, the required number of ways was the number of different
ways of the occurence of the following events in succession:

(i) the event of choosing a school bag
(ii) the event of choosing a tiffin box
(iii) the event of choosing a water bottle.

Here, in both the cases, the events in each problem could occur in various possible
orders. But, we have to choose any one of the possible orders and count the number of
different ways of the occurence of the events in this chosen order.

Example 1 Find the number of 4 letter words, with or without meaning, which can be
formed out of the letters of the word ROSE, where the repetition of the letters is not
allowed.

Solution There are as many words as there are ways of filling in 4 vacant places

by the 4 letters, keeping in mind that the repetition is not allowed. The

first place can be filled in 4 different ways by anyone of the 4 letters R,O,S,E. Following
which, the second place can be filled in by anyone of the remaining 3 letters in 3
different ways, following which the third place can be filled in 2 different ways; following
which, the fourth place can be filled in 1 way. Thus, the number of ways in which the
4 places can be filled, by the multiplication principle, is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. Hence, the
required number of words is 24.

   PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS       103

ANote   If the repetition of the letters was allowed, how many words can be formed?

One can easily understand that each of the 4 vacant places can be filled in succession
in 4 different ways. Hence, the required number of words = 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 256.

Example 2 Given 4 flags of different colours, how many different signals can be
generated, if a signal requires the use of 2 flags one below the other?

Solution There will be as many signals as there are ways of filling in 2 vacant places

 in succession by the 4 flags of different colours. The upper vacant place can

be filled in 4 different ways by anyone of the 4 flags; following which, the lower vacant
place can be filled in 3 different ways by anyone of the remaining 3 different flags.
Hence, by the multiplication principle, the required number of signals = 4 × 3 = 12.

Example 3 How many 2 digit even numbers can be formed from the digits
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 if the digits can be repeated?

Solution There will be as many ways as there are ways of filling 2 vacant places

 in succession by the five given digits. Here, in this case, we start filling in unit’s

place, because the options for this place are 2 and 4 only and this can be done in 2
ways; following which the ten’s place can be filled by any of the 5 digits in 5 different
ways as the digits can be repeated. Therefore, by the multiplication principle, the required
number of two digits even numbers is 2 × 5, i.e., 10.

Example 4 Find the number of different signals that can be generated by arranging at
least 2 flags in order (one below the other) on a vertical staff, if five different flags are
available.

Solution A signal can consist of either 2 flags, 3 flags, 4 flags or 5 flags. Now, let us
count the possible number of signals consisting of 2 flags, 3 flags, 4 flags and 5 flags
separately and then add the respective numbers.

There will be as many 2 flag signals as there are ways of filling in 2 vacant places

 in succession by the 5 flags available. By Multiplication rule, the number of

ways is 5 × 4 = 20.
Similarly, there will be as many 3 flag signals as there are ways of filling in 3

vacant places  in succession by the 5 flags.

Reprint 2025-26



104       MATHEMATICS

The number of ways is 5 × 4 × 3 = 60.
Continuing the same way, we find that

The number of 4 flag signals = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 = 120

and the number of 5 flag signals = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
Therefore, the required no of signals = 20 + 60 + 120 + 120 = 320.

6.3 Permutations

In Example 1 of  the previous Section, we are actually counting the different possible
arrangements of the letters such as ROSE, REOS, ..., etc. Here, in this list, each
arrangement is different from other. In other words, the order of writing the letters is
important. Each arrangement is called a permutation of 4 different letters taken all
at a time. Now, if we have to determine the number of 3-letter words, with or without
meaning, which can be formed out of the letters of the word NUMBER, where the
repetition of the letters is not allowed, we need to count the arrangements NUM,
NMU, MUN, NUB, ..., etc. Here, we are counting the permutations of 6 different
letters taken 3 at a time. The required number of words = 6 × 5 × 4 = 120 (by using
multiplication principle).

If the repetition of the letters was allowed, the required number of words would
be 6 × 6 × 6 = 216.

   PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS       105

Definition 1 A permutation is an arrangement in a definite order of a number of
objects taken some or all at a time.

In the following sub-section, we shall obtain the formula needed to answer these
questions immediately.

6.3.1  Permutations when all the objects are distinct

Theorem 1  The number of permutations of n different objects taken r at a time,
where 0 < r ≤ n  and the objects do not repeat  is n ( n – 1) ( n – 2). . .( n – r + 1),
which is denoted by nP .

r

Proof There will be as many permutations as there are ways of filling in r vacant

places      . . .   by

← r vacant places →

the n objects. The first place can be filled in n ways; following which, the second place
can be filled in (n – 1) ways, following which the third place can be filled in (n – 2)
ways,..., the rth place can be filled in (n – (r – 1)) ways. Therefore, the number of
ways of filling in r vacant places in succession is n(n – 1) (n – 2) . . .   (n – (r – 1)) or
n ( n – 1) (n – 2) ... (n – r + 1)

This expression for nP  is cumbersome and we need a notation which will help to
r

reduce the size of this expression. The symbol n! (read as factorial n or n factorial )
comes to our rescue. In the following text we will learn what actually n! means.

6.3.2  Factorial notation  The notation n! represents the product of first n natural
numbers, i.e., the product 1 × 2 × 3 × . . . × (n – 1) × n is denoted as n!. We read this
symbol as ‘n factorial’. Thus, 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 . . .  × (n – 1) × n = n !

1 = 1 !
1 × 2 = 2 !
1× 2 × 3 = 3 !
1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 4 ! and so on.

We define 0 ! = 1

We can write   5 ! = 5 × 4 ! = 5 × 4 × 3 ! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 !
= 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1!

Clearly, for a natural number n
     n ! = n (n  –  1) !

= n (n  –  1) (n  –  2) ! [provided (n ≥ 2)]
= n (n  –  1) (n  –  2)  (n  –  3) ! [provided (n ≥ 3)]

and so on.

Let us now go back to the stage where we had determined the following formula:
nP  = n (n – 1) (n – 2) . . .  (n – r + 1)

r

Multiplying numerator and denomirator by (n – r) (n – r – 1) . . . 3 × 2 × 1, we get

n n(n −1) (n − 2) ...(n − r +1)(n − r )(n − r −1) ...3× 2×1
Pr = n!

( − )( − − × ×  = ( ,
n r n r 1) ...3 2 1 n − r )!

n n!
Thus Pr =

(n − r )! , where 0 < r ≤ n

This is a much more convenient expression for nP  than the previous one.
r

n n!
In particular, when r = n, Pn = = n!

0!

Counting permutations is merely counting the number of ways in which some or
all objects at a time are rearranged. Arranging no object at all is the same as leaving
behind all the objects and we know that there is only one way of doing so. Thus, we
can have

n! n!
n P  = 1 = = ... (1)

0 n! (n − 0)!

Therefore, the formula (1) is applicable for r = 0 also.

n n!
Thus Pr = , 0 ≤ r ≤ n

(n − r )! .

Let us now find the number of ways of rearranging the letters of the word

these permutations will include those also where 0 is at the 100’s place. For example,

092, 042, . . ., etc are such numbers which are actually 2-digit numbers and hence the

number of such numbers has to be subtracted from 6P to get the required number. To

Solution (i) Given that
n P5 = 42 nP3

or n (n – 1) (n – 2) (n – 3) (n – 4) = 42 n(n – 1) (n – 2)

Since n > 4 so  n(n – 1) (n – 2) ≠ 0

Therefore, by dividing both sides by n(n – 1) (n – 2), we get

(n – 3 (n – 4) = 42

or n2  –  7n  –  30 = 0

or n2 – 10n + 3n – 30

or (n – 10) (n + 3) = 0

or n  –  10 = 0 or    n + 3 = 0

or n = 10 or    n =  – 3

As n cannot be  negative, so  n = 10.

(ii) Given that =

Therefore 3n (n – 1) (n – 2) (n – 3) = 5(n – 1) (n – 2) (n – 3) (n – 4)

or 3n = 5 (n – 4) [as (n – 1) (n – 2) (n – 3) ≠ 0, n > 4]

Example 14 Find the number of different  8-letter arrangements that can be made
from the letters of the word DAUGHTER so that

(i) all vowels occur together (ii) all vowels do not occur together.

Solution (i) There are 8 different letters in the word DAUGHTER, in which there
are 3 vowels, namely, A, U and E. Since the vowels have to occur together, we can for
the time being, assume them as a single object (AUE). This single object together with
5 remaining letters (objects) will be counted as 6 objects. Then we count permutations
of these 6 objects taken all at a time. This number would be 6P  = 6!. Corresponding to

6

each of these permutations, we shall have 3! permutations of the three vowels A, U, E
taken all at a time . Hence, by the multiplication principle the required number of
permutations = 6 ! × 3 ! = 4320.

(ii) If we have to count those permutations in which all vowels are never
together, we first have to find all possible arrangments of 8 letters taken all  at a time,
which can be done in 8! ways. Then, we have to subtract from this number, the number
of permutations in which the vowels are always together.

Therefore, the required number 8 ! – 6 ! × 3 ! = 6 ! (7×8 – 6)
= 2 × 6 ! (28 – 3)
= 50 × 6 ! = 50 × 720 = 36000

Solution There are 12 letters, of which N appears 3 times, E appears 4 times and D

These are XY, YZ and ZX (Fig 6.3).
Here, each selection is called a combination of 3 different objects taken 2 at a time.
In a combination, the order is not important.

Now consider some more illustrations.
Twelve persons meet in a room and each shakes hand with all the others. How do

we determine the number of hand shakes. X shaking hands with Y and  Y with X will
not be two different hand shakes. Here, order is not important. There will be as many
hand shakes as there are combinations of 12 different things taken 2 at a time.

Seven points lie on a circle. How many chords can be drawn by joining these
points pairwise? There will be as many chords as there are combinations of 7 different

Now, we obtain the formula for finding the number of combinations of n different
objects taken r at a time, denoted by nC ..

r

Suppose we have 4 different objects A, B, C and D. Taking 2 at a time, if we have
to make combinations, these will be AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Here,  AB and BA are
the same combination as order does not alter the combination. This is why we have not
included BA, CA, DA, CB, DB and DC in this list. There are as many as 6 combinations
of 4 different objects taken 2 at a time, i.e., 4C  = 6.

2

Corresponding to each combination in the list, we can arrive at 2! permutations as
2 objects in each combination can be rearranged in 2! ways. Hence, the number of
permutations = 4C  × 2!.

On the other hand, the number of permutations of 4 different things taken 2 at

Proof  Corresponding to each combination of nC , we  have r ! permutations, because

nothing at all is considered to be 1. Counting combinations is merely counting the
number of ways in which some or all objects at a time are selected. Selecting

is only one way of doing so. This way we define nC  = 1.

different things taken 4 at a time. Hence, the number of words starting with

4!
A =  4! = 24. Then, starting with G, the number of words =  = 12 as after placing G

2!

at the extreme left position, we are left with the letters A, A, I and N. Similarly, there
are 12 words starting with the next letter I. Total number of words so far obtained
= 24 + 12 + 12 =48.

The 49th word is NAAGI. The 50th word is NAAIG.

Example 23 How many numbers greater than 1000000 can be formed by using the
digits 1, 2, 0, 2, 4, 2, 4?

Solution Since, 1000000 is a 7-digit number and the number of digits to be used is also

7. Therefore, the numbers to be counted will be 7-digit only. Also, the numbers have to

be greater than 1000000, so they can begin either with 1, 2 or 4.

ANote   If one or more than one  digits given in the list is repeated, it will be

Historical Note

The concepts of permutations and combinations can be traced back to the advent
of Jainism in India and perhaps even earlier. The credit, however, goes to the
Jains who treated its subject matter as a self-contained topic in mathematics,
under the name Vikalpa.

Among the Jains, Mahavira, (around 850) is perhaps the world’s first
mathematician credited with providing the general formulae for permutations and
combinations.

In the 6th century B.C., Sushruta, in his medicinal work, Sushruta Samhita,
asserts that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes, taken one at a
time, two at a time, etc. Pingala, a Sanskrit scholar around third century B.C.,
gives the method of determining the number of combinations of a given number
of letters, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc. in his work Chhanda Sutra.
Bhaskaracharya (born 1114) treated the subject matter of permutations and
combinations under the name Anka Pasha in his famous work Lilavati. In addition
to the general formulae for nC  and nP already provided by Mahavira,

r r 

Bhaskaracharya gives several important theorems and results concerning the
subject.

Outside India, the subject matter of permutations and combinations had its
humble beginnings in China in the famous book I–King (Book of changes). It is
difficult to give the approximate time of this work, since in 213 B.C., the emperor
had ordered all books and manuscripts in the country to be burnt which fortunately
was not completely carried out. Greeks and later Latin writers also did some
scattered work on the theory of permutations and combinations.

Some Arabic and Hebrew writers used the concepts of permutations and
combinations in studying astronomy. Rabbi ben Ezra, for instance, determined
the number of combinations of known planets taken two at a time, three at a time
and so on. This was around 1140. It appears that Rabbi ben Ezra did not know

   PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS       125

the formula for nC . However, he was aware that  nC =  nC for specific values
r r n–r 

n and r. In 1321, Levi Ben Gerson, another Hebrew writer came up with the
formulae for nP , nP  and the general formula for nC .

r n r

The first book which gives a complete treatment of the subject matter of
permutations and combinations is Ars Conjectandi written by a Swiss, Jacob
Bernoulli (1654 – 1705), posthumously published in 1713. This book contains
essentially the theory of permutations and combinations as is known today.

BINOMIAL THEOREM

vMathematics is a most exact science and its conclusions are capable of
absolute proofs. –  C.P.  STEINMETZv

7.1 Introduction

In earlier classes, we have learnt how to find the squares
and cubes of binomials like a + b and a – b. Using them, we
could evaluate the numerical values of numbers like
(98)2 = (100 – 2)2, (999)3 = (1000 – 1)3, etc. However, for
higher powers like (98)5, (101)6, etc., the calculations become
difficult by using repeated multiplication. This difficulty was
overcome by a theorem known as binomial theorem. It gives
an easier way to expand (a + b)n, where n is an integer or a
rational number. In this Chapter, we study binomial theorem
for positive integral indices only.

Blaise Pascal
7.2 Binomial Theorem for Positive Integral Indices

(1623-1662)
Let us have a look at the following identities done earlier:

(a+ b)0 = 1 a + b ≠ 0
(a+ b)1 = a + b
(a+ b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2

(a+ b)3 = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3

(a+ b)4 = (a + b)3 (a + b) = a4 + 4a3b + 6a2b2 + 4ab3 + b4

In these expansions, we observe that
(i) The total number of terms in the expansion is one more than the index. For

example, in the expansion of (a + b)2 , number of terms is 3 whereas the index of
(a + b)2 is 2.

(ii) Powers of the first quantity ‘a’ go on decreasing by 1 whereas the powers of the
second quantity ‘b’ increase by 1, in the successive terms.

(iii) In each term of the expansion, the sum of the indices of a and b is the same and
is equal to the index of a + b.

Reprint 2025-26



BINOMIAL THEOREM       127

We now arrange the coefficients in these expansions as follows (Fig 7.1):

Fig 7.1

Do we observe any pattern in this table that will help us to write the next row? Yes we
do. It can be seen that the addition of 1’s in the row for index 1 gives rise to 2 in the row
for index 2. The addition of 1, 2 and 2, 1 in the row for index 2, gives rise to 3 and 3 in
the row for index 3 and so on. Also, 1 is present at the beginning and at the end of each
row. This can be continued till any index of our interest.

We can extend the pattern given in Fig 7.2 by writing a few more rows.

Fig 7.2

Pascal’s Triangle
The structure given in Fig 7.2  looks like a triangle with 1 at the top vertex and running
down the two slanting sides. This array of numbers is known as Pascal’s triangle,
after the name of French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It is also known as Meru
Prastara by Pingla.

Expansions for the higher powers of a binomial are also possible by using Pascal’s
triangle. Let us expand (2x + 3y)5 by using Pascal’s triangle. The row for index 5 is

1 5 10 10 5 1
Using this row and our observations (i), (ii) and (iii), we get
(2x + 3y)5 = (2x)5 + 5(2x)4 (3y) + 10(2x)3 (3y)2 +10 (2x)2 (3y)3 + 5(2x)(3y)4 +(3y)5

= 32x5 + 240x4y + 720x3y2 + 1080x2y3 + 810xy4 + 243y5.

Reprint 2025-26



128       MATHEMATICS

Now, if we want to find the expansion of (2x + 3y)12, we are first required to get
the row for index 12. This can be done by writing all the rows of the Pascal’s triangle
till index 12. This is a slightly lengthy process. The process, as you observe, will become
more difficult, if we need the expansions involving still larger powers.

We thus try to find a rule that will help us to find the expansion of the binomial for
any power without writing all the rows of the Pascal’s triangle, that come before the
row of the desired index.

For this, we make use of the concept of combinations studied earlier to rewrite

n n!
the numbers in the Pascal’s triangle. We know that  Cr =  , 0 ≤  r ≤ n and

r!(n – r)!

n is a non-negative integer. Also,   nC  = 1 = nC
0 n

The Pascal’s triangle can now be rewritten as (Fig 7.3)

Fig  7.3     Pascal’s triangle

Observing this pattern, we can now write the row of the Pascal’s triangle for any index
without writing the earlier rows. For example, for the index 7 the row would be

7C   7C 7C 7C 7C 7C 7C 7C
0 1    2    3    4    5    6    7.

Thus, using this row and the observations (i), (ii) and (iii), we have

(a + b)7 = 7C a7 + 7C a6b + 7C a5b2 + 7C a4b3 + 7C a3b4 + 7C a2b5 + 7C ab6 + 7C b7
0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7

An expansion of a binomial to any positive integral index say n can now be visualised
using these observations. We are now in a position to write the expansion of a binomial
to any positive integral index.

BINOMIAL THEOREM       129

7.2.1  Binomial theorem  for any positive integer n,

(a + b)n = nC an + nC an–1b + nC an–2 b2 + ...+ nC a.bn–1 + nC bn
0 1 2 n – 1 n

Proof  The proof is obtained by applying principle of mathematical induction.

Let the given statement be

P(n) : (a + b)n = nC an + nC an – 1b + nC an – 2b2 + ...+ nC a.bn – 1 + nC bn
0 1 2 n–1 n

For n = 1, we have

P (1) : (a + b)1 = 1C a1 + 1C b1 = a + b
0 1

Thus, P (1) is true.

Suppose P (k) is true for some positive integer k, i.e.

(a + b)k = kC ak + kC ak – 1b + kC ak – 2b2 + ...+ kC bk . . .
0 1 2 k

(1)

We shall prove that P(k + 1) is also true, i.e.,

(a + b)k + 1 = k + 1C ak + 1 + k + 1C akb + k + 1C ak – 1b2 + ...+ k + 1C bk + 1
0 1 2 k+1 

Now, (a + b)k + 1 = (a + b) (a + b)k

= (a + b) (kC ak + kC ak – 1 b + kC ak – 2 b2 +...+ kC abk – 1 + kC bk)
0 1 2 k – 1 k 

[from (1)]

= kC ak + 1 + kC akb + kC ak – 1b2 +...+ kC a2bk – 1 + kC abk + kC akb
0 1 2 k – 1 k 0 

+ kC ak – 1b2 + kC ak – 2b3+...+ kC abk + kC bk + 1

[by actual multiplication]

    + (kC + kC ) abk + kC bk + 1      [grouping like terms]
k k–1 k

= k + 1C a k + 1 + k + 1C akb + k + 1C  ak – 1b2 +...+ k + 1C abk + k + 1C bk +1
0 1 2 k k + 1 

(by using  k + 1C =1,  kC + kC =  k + 1C and   kC = 1= k + 1C )
0 r r–1 r k  k + 1

Thus, it has been proved that P (k + 1) is true whenever P(k) is true. Therefore, by
principle of mathematical induction, P(n) is true for every positive integer n.

We illustrate this theorem by expanding (x + 2)6:

(x + 2)6 = 6C x6 + 6C x5.2 + 6C x422 + 6C x3.23  + 6C x2.24 + 6C x.25 + 6C .26.
0 1 2 3 4 5 6

= x6 + 12x5 + 60x4 + 160x3 + 240x2 + 192x + 64

Thus (x + 2)6 = x6 + 12x5 + 60x4 + 160x3 + 240x2 + 192x + 64.

3. There are (n+1) terms in the expansion of (a+b)n, i.e., one more than the index.
4. In the successive terms of the expansion the index of a goes on decreasing by

unity. It is n in the first term, (n–1) in the second term, and so on ending with zero
in the last term. At the same time the index of b increases by unity, starting with
zero in the first term, 1 in the second and so on ending with n in the last term.

5. In the expansion of (a+b)n, the sum of the indices of a and b is n + 0 = n in the
first term, (n – 1) + 1 = n in the second term and so on 0 + n = n in the last term.
Thus, it can be seen that the sum of the indices of a and b is n in every term of the
expansion.

7.2.2 Some special cases In the expansion of (a + b)n,

(i) Taking a = x and b = – y, we obtain

(x – y)n = [x + (–y)]n

= nC xn + nC xn – 1(–y) + nC xn–2(–y)2 + nC xn–3(–y)3 + ... + nC  (–y)n

= nC xn – nC xn – 1y + nC xn – 2y2 – nC xn – 3y3 + ... + (–1)n nC  yn
0 1 2 3 n

Thus (x–y)n = nC xn – nC xn – 1 y + nC xn – 2 y2 + ... + (–1)n nC  yn
0 1 2 n

Using this, we have (x–2y)5 =  5C x5 – 5C x4 (2y) + 5C x3 (2y)2 – 5C x2 (2y)3 +

  = x5 –10x4y + 40x3y2 – 80x2y3 + 80xy4 – 32y5.

(ii) Taking a = 1, b = x, we obtain

(1 + x)n = nC (1)n + nC (1)n – 1x + nC (1)n – 2 x2 + ... + nC xn
0 1 2 n

= nC  + nC x + nC x2 + nC x3 + ... + nC xn

Example 4 Using binomial theorem, prove that 6n–5n always leaves remainder

1 when divided by 25.

Solution For two numbers a and b if we can find numbers q and r such that

a = bq + r, then we say that b divides a with q as quotient and r as remainder. Thus, in
order to show that  6n – 5n leaves remainder 1 when divided by 25, we prove that

6n – 5n = 25k + 1, where k is some natural number.

We have

(1 + a)n = nC  + nC a + nC a2 + ... + nC an
0 1 2 n

For a    = 5, we get

          (1 + 5)n = nC  + nC 5 + nC 52 + ... + nC 5n
0 1 2 n

i.e. (6)n = 1 + 5n + 52.nC  + 53.nC  + ... + 5n

i.e. 6n – 5n = 1+52 (nC  + nC 5 + ... + 5n-2)

or 6n – 5n = 1+ 25 (nC + 5 .nC  + ... + 5n-2)
2 3

or 6n – 5n = 25k+1     where k =  nC + 5 .nC  + ... + 5n–2.

This shows that when divided by 25, 6n – 5n leaves remainder 1.

Historical Note

The ancient Indian mathematicians knew about the coefficients in the
expansions of (x + y)n, 0 ≤ n ≤ 7. The arrangement of these coefficients was in
the form of a diagram called Meru-Prastara, provided by Pingla in his book
Chhanda shastra (200B.C.). This triangular arrangement is also found in the
work of Chinese mathematician Chu-shi-kie in 1303. The term binomial coefficients
was first introduced by the German mathematician, Michael Stipel (1486-1567) in
approximately 1544. Bombelli (1572) also gave the coefficients in the expansion of
(a + b)n, for n = 1,2 ...,7 and Oughtred (1631) gave them for n = 1, 2,..., 10. The
arithmetic triangle, popularly known as Pascal’s triangle and similar to the Meru-
Prastara of Pingla was constructed by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal
(1623-1662) in 1665.

The present form of the binomial theorem  for integral values of n appeared in
Trate du triange arithmetic, written by Pascal and published posthumously in
1665.

8.1 Introduction

In mathematics, the word, “sequence” is used in much the
same way as it is in ordinary English. When we say that a
collection of objects is listed in a sequence, we usually  mean
that the collection is ordered in such a way that it has an
identified first member, second member, third member and
so on. For example, population of human beings or bacteria
at different times form a sequence. The amount of money
deposited in a bank, over a number of years form a sequence.
Depreciated values of certain commodity occur in a
sequence. Sequences have important applications in several Fibonacci
spheres of human activities. (1175-1250)

Sequences, following specific patterns are called progressions. In previous class,
we have studied about arithmetic progression (A.P). In this Chapter, besides discussing
more about A.P.; arithmetic mean, geometric mean, relationship between A.M.
and G.M., special series in forms of sum to n terms of consecutive natural numbers,
sum to n terms of squares of natural numbers and sum to n terms of cubes of
natural numbers will also be studied.

8.2  Sequences

Let us consider the following examples:
Assume that there is a generation gap of 30 years, we are asked to find the

number of ancestors, i.e., parents, grandparents, great grandparents, etc. that a person
might have over 300 years.

Here, the total number of generations 300
= =10

30

Reprint 2025-26



136       MATHEMATICS

The number of person’s ancestors for the first, second, third, …, tenth generations are
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, …, 1024. These numbers form what we call a sequence.

Consider the successive quotients that we obtain in the division of 10 by 3 at
different steps of division. In this process we get 3,3.3,3.33,3.333, ... and so on. These
quotients also form a sequence. The various numbers occurring in a sequence are
called its terms. We denote the terms of a sequence by a , a , a , …, a , …, etc., the

1 2 3 n

subscripts denote the position of the term. The nth term is the number at the nth position
of the sequence and is denoted by a The nth term is also called the general term of the

n.
  

sequence.
Thus, the terms of the sequence of person’s ancestors mentioned above are:

a  = 2, a  = 4, a  = 8, …, a  = 1024.
1 2 3 10

Similarly, in the example of successive quotients
a  = 3, a  = 3.3, a  = 3.33, …, a  = 3.33333, etc.

1 2 3 6

A sequence containing finite number of terms is called a finite sequence. For
example, sequence of ancestors is a finite sequence since it contains 10 terms (a fixed
number).

A sequence is called infinite, if it is not a finite sequence. For example, the
sequence of successive quotients mentioned above is an infinite sequence, infinite in
the sense that it never ends.

Often, it is possible to express the rule, which yields the various terms of a sequence
in terms of algebraic formula. Consider for instance, the sequence of even natural
numbers 2, 4, 6, …

Here a  = 2 = 2 × 1 a  = 4 = 2 × 2
1 2

a  = 6 = 2 × 3 a  = 8 = 2 × 4
3 4

....     ....    .... ....     ....    ....

....     ....    .... ....     ....    ....

a  = 46 = 2 × 23, a  = 48 = 2 × 24, and so on.
23 24

In fact, we see that the nth term of this sequence can be written as a  =  2n,
n  

where n is a natural number. Similarly, in the sequence of odd natural numbers 1,3,5, …,
the nth term is given by the formula, a  = 2n – 1, where n is a natural number.

n

In some cases, an arrangement of numbers such as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,.. has no visible
pattern, but the sequence is generated by the recurrence relation given by

a  = a  = 1
1 2

a  = a  + a
3 1 2

a  = a  + a , n > 2
n n – 2 n – 1

This sequence is called Fibonacci sequence.

SEQUENCES AND SERIES       137

In the sequence of primes 2,3,5,7,…, we find that there is no formula for the nth

prime. Such sequence can only be described by verbal description.
In every sequence, we should not expect that its terms will  necessarily be given

by a specific formula. However, we expect a theoretical scheme or a rule for generating
the terms a , a , a ,…,a ,… in succession.

1 2  3 n

In view of the above, a sequence can be regarded as a function whose domain
is the set of natural numbers or some subset of it. Sometimes, we use the functional
notation a(n) for an.

8.3  Series

Let a , a , a ,…,a , be a given sequence. Then, the expression
1 2  3 n

a  + a + a  +,…+ a + ...
1 2  3 n  

is called the series associated with the given sequence .The series is finite or infinite
according as the given sequence is finite or infinite. Series are often represented in

compact form, called sigma notation, using the Greek letter ∑ (sigma) as means of
indicating the summation involved. Thus, the series a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + an   is abbreviated

n

as ∑ak
 

k = .
1

Remark When the series is used, it refers to the indicated sum not to the sum itself.
For example, 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 is a finite series with four terms. When we use the phrase
“sum of a series,” we will mean the number that results from adding the terms, the
sum of the series is 16.

We now consider some examples.

Example 1 Write the first three terms in each of the following sequences defined by
the following:

n − 3
(i) an = 2n + 5, (ii) an = .

Solution  (i) Here  an = 2n + 5

Substituting n = 1, 2, 3, we get

a  = 2(1) + 5 = 7, a  = 9, a  = 11

Therefore, the required terms are 7, 9 and 11.

a  = (20 – 1) (2 – 20) (3 + 20)
20

      =  19 × (– 18) × (23) = – 7866.

Example 3 Let the sequence an be defined as follows:

a  = 1,  a  = a  + 2 for n ≥ 2.

Similarly, state how do the terms in (iii) progress? It is observed that in each case,
every term except the first term bears a constant ratio to the term immediately preceding

1
it. In (i), this constant ratio is 2; in (ii), it is –  and in (iii), the constant ratio is 0.01.

As in case of arithmetic progression, the problem of finding the nth term or sum of n
terms of a geometric progression containing a large number of  terms would be difficult
without the use of the formulae which we shall develop in the next Section. We shall
use the following notations with these formulae:

a = the first term, r = the common ratio, l = the last term,

n = the numbers of terms,

S  = the sum of first n terms.
n

8.4.1  General term of a G .P. Let us consider a G.P. with first non-zero term ‘a’ and
common ratio ‘r’. Write a few terms of it. The second  term is obtained by multiplying
a by r, thus a  = ar. Similarly, third term is obtained by multiplying a  by r. Thus,

2 2

a  = a r = ar2, and so on.
3 2

We write below these and few more terms.
1st term = a  = a = ar1–1, 2nd term = a  = ar = ar2–1, 3rd term = a  = ar2 = ar3–1

1 2 3

4th term = a  = ar3 = ar4–1, 5th term = a  = ar4 = ar5–1
4 5

Do you see a pattern? What will be 16th term?
a = ar16–1 = ar15

16 

Therefore, the pattern suggests that the nth term of a G.P. is given by
a = arn–1.

n S
Thus, a, G.P. can be written as a, ar, ar2, ar3, … arn – 1; a, ar, ar2,...,arn – 1... ;according
as G.P. is finite or infinite, respectively.

The series a + ar + ar2 + ... + arn–1 or a + ar + ar2 + ... + arn–1 +...are called
finite or infinite geometric series, respectively.

8.4.2.  Sum to n terms of a G .P. Let the first term of a G.P. be a and the common
ratio be r. Let us denote by S  the sum to first n terms of G.P. Then

n

S  = a + ar + ar2 +...+ arn–1 ... (1)

Case 1 If    r = 1, we have  Sn = a + a + a + ... + a (n terms)  = na

Case 2 If    r ≠ 1, multiplying (1) by r, we have
                         rS  = ar + ar2 + ar3 + ... + arn ... (2)

Subtracting (2) from (1), we get (1 – r) S  = a – arn  = a(1 – rn)

Solution Let 131072 be the nth term of the given G.P. Here a = 2 and r = 4.
Therefore 131072 = a  = 2(4)n – 1 or 65536 = 4n – 1

n

This gives 48 = 4n – 1.

So that n – 1 = 8, i.e., n = 9. Hence, 131072 is the 9th term of  the G.P.

But L.H.S.

Since the sum of squares of real numbers is non negative, therefore, from (1) and (2),
we have, (ap  – b)2 + (bp  – c)2 + (cp  – d)2 = 0

Summary

®By a sequence, we mean an arrangement of number in definite order according

to some rule. Also, we define a sequence as a function whose domain is the
set of natural numbers or some subsets of the type {1, 2, 3, ....k}. A sequence

containing a finite number of terms is called a finite sequence. A sequence is
called infinite if it is not a finite sequence.

®Let a , a , a , ... be the sequence, then the sum expressed as a  + a  + a  + ...
1 2 3 1 2 3

is called series. A series is called finite series if it has got finite number of
terms.

®A sequence is said to be a geometric progression or G.P., if the ratio of any

term to its preceding term is same throughout. This constant factor is called

the common ratio. Usually, we denote the first term of a G.P. by a and its

common ratio by r. The general or the nth term of G.P. is given by a = arn – 1.
n

The sum S  of the first n terms of G.P. is given by
n

Sn = or , if r ≠1

r – 1 1 – r

®The geometric mean (G.M.) of any two positive numbers a and b is given by

ab  i.e., the sequence a, G, b is G.P.

Historical Note

Evidence is found that Babylonians, some 4000 years ago, knew of arithmetic and
geometric sequences. According to Boethius (510), arithmetic and geometric
sequences were known to early Greek writers. Among the Indian mathematician,
Aryabhatta (476) was the first to give the formula for the sum of squares and cubes
of natural numbers in his famous work Aryabhatiyam, written around
499. He also gave the formula for finding the sum to n terms of an arithmetic
sequence starting with pth term. Noted Indian mathematicians Brahmgupta

150       MATHEMATICS

(598), Mahavira (850) and Bhaskara (1114-1185) also considered the sum of squares
and cubes.  Another specific type of sequence having important applications in
mathematics, called Fibonacci sequence, was discovered by Italian mathematician
Leonardo Fibonacci (1170-1250). Seventeenth century witnessed the classification
of series into specific forms. In 1671 James Gregory used the term infinite series in
connection with infinite sequence. It was only through the rigorous development of
algebraic and set theoretic tools that the concepts related to sequence and series
could be formulated suitably.

vG eometry, as a logical system, is a means and even the most powerful
means to make children feel the strength of the human spirit that is

of their own spirit.  – H. FREUDENTHALv

9.1  Introduction

We are familiar with two-dimensional coordinate geometry
from earlier classes. Mainly, it is a combination of algebra
and geometry. A systematic study of geometry by the use
of algebra was first carried out by celebrated French
philosopher and mathematician René Descartes, in his book
‘La Géométry, published in 1637. This book introduced the
notion of the equation of a curve and related analytical
methods into the study of geometry. The resulting
combination of analysis and geometry is referred now as
analytical geometry. In the earlier classes, we initiated
the study of coordinate geometry, where we   studied about René Descartes

coordinate axes, coordinate plane, plotting of points in a  (1596 -1650)

plane, distance between two points, section formulae, etc. All these concepts are the
basics of coordinate geometry.

Let us have a brief recall of coordinate geometry done in earlier classes. To
recapitulate, the location of the points (6, – 4) and
(3, 0) in the XY-plane is shown in Fig 9.1.

We may note that the point (6, – 4) is at 6 units
distance from the y-axis measured along the positive
x-axis and at 4 units distance from the x-axis
measured along the negative y-axis. Similarly, the
point (3, 0) is at 3 units distance from the y-axis
measured along  the positive x-axis and has zero
distance from the x-axis.

We also studied there following important Fig 9.1
formulae:

Remark If the area of the triangle ABC is zero, then three points A, B and C lie on
a line, i.e., they are collinear.

In the this Chapter, we shall continue the study of coordinate geometry to study
properties of the simplest geometric figure – straight line. Despite its simplicity, the
line is a vital concept of geometry and enters into our daily experiences in numerous
interesting and useful ways. Main focus is on representing the line algebraically, for
which slope is most essential.

9.2  Slope of a Line
A line in a coordinate plane forms two angles with the x-axis, which are supplementary.

Reprint 2025-26



STRAIGHT LINES       153

The angle (say) θ made by the line l with positive
direction of x-axis and measured anti clockwise
is called the inclination of the line. Obviously
0° ≤ θ ≤ 180° (Fig 9.2).

We observe that lines parallel to x-axis, or
coinciding with x-axis, have inclination of 0°. The
inclination of a vertical line (parallel to or
coinciding with y-axis) is 90°.

Definition 1 If θ is the inclination of a line
l, then tan θ is called the slope or gradient of
the line l. Fig 9.2

The slope of a line whose inclination is 90° is not
defined.
The slope of a line is denoted by m.
Thus, m = tan θ, θ ≠ 90°
It may be observed that the slope of x-axis is zero and slope of y-axis is not defined.

9.2.1 Slope of a line when coordinates of any two points on the line are given
We know that a line is completely determined when we are given two points on it.
Hence, we proceed to find the slope of a
line in terms of the coordinates of two points
on the line.

Let P(x , y ) and Q(x , y ) be two
1 1 2 2

points on non-vertical line l whose inclination
is θ. Obviously, x  ≠ x , otherwise the line

1 2

will become perpendicular to x-axis and its
slope will not be defined. The inclination of
the line l may be acute or obtuse. Let us
take these two cases.

Draw perpendicular QR to x-axis and
PM perpendicular to RQ as shown in
Figs. 9.3 (i) and (ii).

Case 1 When angle  θ is acute:

In Fig 9.3 (i), ∠MPQ =  θ. ... (1)

Case II  When angle θ is obtuse:
In Fig 9.3 (ii), we have
 ∠MPQ = 180° –  θ.

Therefore,  θ = 180° – ∠MPQ.

Now, slope of the line l

9.2.2 Conditions for parallelism and perpendicularity of lines in terms of their
slopes In a coordinate plane, suppose that non-vertical lines l and l  have slopes m

1 2 1

and m , respectively. Let their inclinations be α and
2

β, respectively.

If the line l  is parallel to l (Fig 9.4), then their
1 2 

inclinations are equal, i.e.,

α = β, and hence, tan α = tan β
Therefore m  = m , i.e., their slopes are equal.

1 2

Conversely, if the slope of two lines l  and l
1 2

is same, i.e.,

m  = m .
1 2 Fig 9. 4

Then tan α = tan β.

By the property of tangent function (between 0° and 180°), α = β.
Therefore, the lines are parallel.

Reprint 2025-26



STRAIGHT LINES       155

Hence, two non vertical lines l and l  are parallel if and only if their slopes
1 2

are equal.

If the lines l  and l  are perpendicular (Fig 9.5), then β = α + 90°.

Therefore, tan β = tan (α + 90°)

1 2

Then tan α = – cot β = tan (β + 90°) or tan (β – 90°)
Fig 9. 5

Therefore, α  and β differ by 90°.

Thus, lines l  and l  are perpendicular to each other.

Hence, two non-vertical lines are perpendicular to each other if and only if
their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other,

9.2.3 Angle between two lines When we think about more than one line in a plane,

then we find that these lines are either intersecting or parallel. Here we will discuss the

angle between two lines in terms of their slopes.

9.3   Various Forms of the Equation of a Line

We know that every line in a plane contains infinitely many points on it. This relationship
between line and points leads us to find the solution of the following problem:

How can we say that a given point lies on the given line? Its answer may be that
for a given line we should have a definite condition on the points lying on the line.
Suppose P (x, y) is an arbitrary point in the XY-plane and L is the given line. For the
equation of L, we wish to construct a statement or condition for the point P that is
true, when P is on L, otherwise false. Of course the statement is merely an algebraic
equation involving the variables x and y. Now, we will discuss the equation of a line
under different conditions.

9.3.1 Horizontal and vertical lines If a horizontal line L is at a distance a from the x-
axis then ordinate of every point lying on the line is either a or – a [Fig 9.8 (a)].
Therefore, equation of the line L is either y =  a or y = – a. Choice of sign will depend
upon the position of the line according as the line is above or below the y-axis. Similarly,
the equation of a vertical line at a distance b from the y-axis is either x = b or
x =  – b  [Fig 9.8(b)].

Case I Suppose a line L with slope m cuts
the y-axis at a distance c from the origin
(Fig 9.12). The distance c is called the y-
intercept of the line L. Obviously,
coordinates of the point where the line meet
the y-axis are (0, c). Thus, L has slope m
and passes through a fixed point (0, c).
Therefore, by point-slope form, the equation
of L is

Fig 9.12
y − c = m( x − 0 ) or y = mx + c

Thus, the point (x, y) on the line with slope m and y-intercept c lies on the line if and
only if

y = mx +c ...(3)
Note that the value of c will be positive or negative according as the intercept is made
on the positive or negative side of the y-axis, respectively.

Case II Suppose line L with slope m makes x-intercept d. Then equation of L is
y = m(x – d) ... (4)

Students may derive this equation themselves by the same method as in Case I.

y = x − or 2 y − x + 3 = 0 ,

(ii) Here, we have m = tan θ  = and d = 4.

vLet the relation of knowledge to real life be very visible to your pupils
and let them understand how by knowledge the world could be

transformed. – BERTRAND RUSSELL v

10.1 Introduction

In the preceding Chapter 10, we have studied various forms

of the equations of a line. In this Chapter, we shall study

about some other curves, viz., circles, ellipses, parabolas

and hyperbolas. The names parabola and hyperbola are

given by Apollonius. These curves are in fact, known as

conic sections or more commonly conics because they

can be obtained as intersections of a plane with a double

napped right circular cone. These curves have a very wide

range of applications in fields such as planetary motion, Apollonius

design of telescopes and antennas, reflectors in flashlights (262 B.C. -190 B.C.)

and automobile headlights, etc.  Now, in the subsequent sections we will see how the

intersection of a plane with a double napped right circular cone

results in different types of curves.

10.2 Sections of a Cone

Let l be a fixed vertical line and m be another line intersecting it at

a fixed point V and inclined to it at an angle α (Fig10.1).

Suppose we rotate the line m around the line l in such a way

that the angle α remains constant.  Then the surface generated is

a double-napped right circular hollow cone herein after referred as Fig 10. 1

cone and extending indefinitely far in both directions (Fig10.2).

The point V is called the vertex; the line l is the axis of the cone. The rotating line
m is called a generator of the cone.  The vertex separates the cone into two parts
called nappes.

If we take the intersection of a plane with a cone, the section so obtained is called
a conic section. Thus, conic sections are the curves obtained by intersecting a right
circular cone by a plane.

We obtain different kinds of conic sections depending on the position of the
intersecting plane with respect to the cone and by the angle made by it with the vertical
axis of the cone. Let β be the angle made by the intersecting plane with the vertical
axis of the cone (Fig10.3).

The intersection of the plane with the cone can take place either at the vertex of
the cone or at any other part of the nappe either below or above the vertex.

10.2.1 Circle, ellipse, parabola and hyperbola When the plane cuts the nappe (other
than the vertex) of the cone, we have the following situations:
(a) When β = 90o,  the section is a circle (Fig10.4).
(b) When α < β <  90o, the section is an ellipse (Fig10.5).
(c) When β = α; the section is a parabola (Fig10.6).
(In each of the above three situations, the plane cuts entirely across one nappe of
the cone).

(d) When 0 ≤ β < α; the plane cuts through both the nappes and the curves of
intersection is a hyperbola (Fig10.7).

10.2.2  Degenerated conic sections
When the plane cuts at the vertex of the cone, we have  the following  different cases:
(a) When α < β ≤ 90o, then the section is a point (Fig10.8).

(b) When β = α, the plane contains a generator of the cone and the section is a
straight line  (Fig10.9).

It is the degenerated case of a parabola.

(c) When 0 ≤ β < α, the section is a pair of intersecting straight lines (Fig10.10).
It is the degenerated case of a hyperbola.

10.3 Circle

Definition 1 A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed
point in the plane.

The fixed point is called the centre of the circle and the distance from the centre
to a point on the circle is called the radius of the circle (Fig 10.11).

Fig 10. 11 Fig 10. 12

The equation of the circle is simplest if the centre of the circle is at the origin.
However, we derive below the equation of the circle with a given centre and radius
(Fig 10.12).

Given C (h, k) be the centre and r the radius of circle. Let P(x, y) be any point on
the circle (Fig10.12).  Then,  by the definition, | CP | = r . By the distance formula,
we have

(x – h)2 + (y – k)2 = r

i.e. (x – h)2 + (y – k)2 = r2

This is the required equation of the circle with centre at (h,k) and radius r .

Example 1  Find an equation of the circle with centre at (0,0) and radius r.

Solution Here  h = k = 0. Therefore, the equation of the circle is x2 + y2 = r2.

Example 2 Find the equation of the circle with centre (–3, 2) and radius 4.

Solution Here h = –3, k = 2 and r = 4. Therefore, the equation of the required circle is

(x + 3)2 + (y –2)2 = 16

Example 3 Find the centre and the radius of the circle x2 + y2 + 8x + 10y – 8 = 0

Solution  The given equation is

(x2 + 8x)  + (y2 + 10y) = 8

Now, completing the squares within the parenthesis, we get

(x2 + 8x + 16)  +  (y2 + 10y + 25)  = 8 + 16 + 25

i.e. (x + 4)2 + (y + 5)2 = 49

i.e. {x – (– 4)}2 + {y – (–5)}2 = 72

Therefore, the given circle has centre at (– 4, –5) and radius 7.

Example 4 Find the equation of the circle which passes through the points (2, – 2), and
(3,4) and whose centre lies on the line x + y = 2.

Solution Let the equation of the circle be (x – h)2 + (y – k)2 = r2.

Since the circle passes through (2, – 2) and (3,4), we have
(2 – h)2 + (–2 – k)2 = r2 ... (1)

and (3 – h)2 + (4 – k)2 = r2 ... (2)
Also since the centre lies on the line x + y = 2, we have

h + k = 2 ... (3)
Solving the equations (1), (2) and (3), we get

h = 0.7,   k = 1.3  and r2 = 12.58
Hence, the equation of the required circle is

(x – 0.7)2 + (y – 1.3)2 = 12.58.

10.4  Parabola

Definition 2 A parabola is the set of all points
in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed line
and a fixed point (not on the line) in the plane.

The fixed line is called the directrix of
the parabola and the fixed point F is called the
focus (Fig 10.13). (‘Para’ means ‘for’ and
‘bola’ means ‘throwing’, i.e., the shape
described when you throw a ball in the air).

ANote   If the fixed point lies on the fixed
line, then the set of points in the plane, which Fig 10. 13
are equidistant from the fixed point and the
fixed line is the straight line through the fixed
point and perpendicular to the fixed line.  We
call this straight line as degenerate case of
the parabola.

A line through the focus  and perpendicular
to the directrix  is called the axis of the
parabola. The point of intersection of parabola
with the axis is called the vertex of the parabola
(Fig10.14).

10.4.1 Standard equations of parabola Fig 10.14
The equation of a parabola is simplest if the
vertex is at the origin and the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis or y-axis. The four
possible such orientations of parabola are shown below in  Fig10.15 (a) to (d).

Fig 10.15 (a) to (d)

We will derive the equation for the parabola shown above in Fig 10.15 (a) with
focus at (a, 0) a > 0; and directricx x = – a as below:

Let F be the focus and l the directrix.  Let
FM be perpendicular to the directrix and bisect
FM at the point O.  Produce MO to X.  By the
definition of  parabola, the mid-point O is on the
parabola and is called the vertex of the parabola.
Take O as origin, OX the x-axis and OY
perpendicular to it as the y-axis.  Let the distance
from the directrix to the focus be 2a. Then, the
coordinates of the focus are (a, 0),  and the
equation of the directrix is x + a = 0 as in Fig10.16.
Let P(x, y) be any point on the parabola such that Fig 10.16

PF = PB, ... (1)
where PB is perpendicular to l. The coordinates of B are (– a, y). By the distance
formula, we have

PF = 2 2
(x – a) + y  and PB = + 2

(x a)
Since PF = PB, we have

2 2 2
(x – a) + y = (x + a)

i.e. (x – a)2 + y2 = (x + a)2

or x2 – 2ax + a2 + y2 = x2 + 2ax + a2

or y2 = 4ax ( a > 0).

Reprint 2025-26



184    MATHEMATICS

Hence, any point on the parabola satisfies
y2 = 4ax. ... (2)

Conversely, let P(x, y) satisfy the equation (2)

PF = 2 2 2
(x – a) + y = (x – a) + 4ax

2
= (x + a) = PB ... (3)

and  so P(x,y) lies  on the parabola.

Thus, from (2) and (3) we have  proved that the equation to the parabola with
vertex at the origin, focus at (a,0) and directrix x = – a is y2 = 4ax.

Discussion In equation (2), since a > 0, x  can assume any positive value or zero but
no negative value and the curve extends indefinitely far into the first and the fourth
quadrants. The axis of the parabola is the positive x-axis.

Similarly, we can derive the equations of the parabolas in:

Fig 11.15 (b) as y2 = – 4ax,
Fig 11.15 (c) as x2 = 4ay,

Fig 11.15 (d) as x2 = – 4ay,

These four equations are known as standard equations of parabolas.

ANote   The standard equations of  parabolas have focus on one of the coordinate

axis; vertex at the origin and thereby the directrix is parallel to the other coordinate
axis. However, the study of the equations of parabolas with focus at any point and
any line as directrix is beyond the scope here.

From the standard equations of the parabolas, Fig10.15, we have the following
observations:

1. Parabola is symmetric with respect to the axis of the parabola.If the equation
has a y2 term, then the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis and if the
equation has an x2 term, then the axis of symmetry is along the y-axis.

2. When the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis the parabola opens to the

(a) right if the coefficient of x is positive,
(b) left if the coefficient of x  is negative.

3. When the axis of symmetry is along the y-axis the parabola opens

(c) upwards if the coefficient of y is positive.
(d) downwards if the coefficient of y is negative.

10.4.2 Latus rectum

Definition 3 Latus rectum of a parabola is a line segment perpendicular to the axis of

the parabola, through the focus and whose end points lie on the parabola (Fig10.17).

To find the Length of the latus rectum of the parabola y2 = 4ax (Fig 10.18).

By the definition of the parabola, AF = AC.

But AC = FM = 2a

Hence AF = 2a.

And since the parabola is symmetric with respect to x-axis AF = FB and so

AB = Length of the latus rectum = 4a.

Fig 10.17 Fig 10.18

Example 5 Find the coordinates of the focus, axis,
the equation of the directrix and latus rectum of
the parabola y2 = 8x.

Solution The given equation involves y2, so the
axis of symmetry is along the x-axis.
The coefficient of x is positive so the parabola opens
to the right. Comparing with the given equation
y2 = 4ax, we find that a = 2. Fig 10.19

Thus, the focus of the parabola is (2, 0) and the equation of the directrix of the parabola
is x = – 2 (Fig 10.19).

Length of the latus rectum is 4a = 4 × 2 = 8.

Example 6 Find the equation of the parabola with focus (2,0) and directrix x = – 2.

Solution Since the focus (2,0) lies on the  x-axis, the x-axis itself is the axis of the
parabola. Hence the equation of the parabola is of the form either
y2 = 4ax or  y2 = – 4ax. Since the directrix is x = – 2 and the focus is (2,0), the parabola
is to be of the form y2 = 4ax with a = 2. Hence the required equation is

       y2 = 4(2)x = 8x

Example 7 Find the equation of the parabola with vertex  at (0, 0) and focus at (0, 2).

Solution Since the vertex is at (0,0) and the focus is at (0,2) which lies on y-axis, the
y-axis is the axis of the parabola. Therefore, equation of the parabola is of the form
x2 = 4ay. thus, we have

x2 = 4(2)y, i.e., x2 = 8y.

Example 8 Find the equation of the parabola which is symmetric about the y-axis, and
passes through the point (2,–3).

Solution Since the parabola is symmetric about y-axis and has its vertex at the origin,
the equation is of the form x2 = 4ay or x2 = – 4ay, where the sign depends on whether
the parabola opens upwards or downwards. But the parabola passes through (2,–3)
which lies in the fourth quadrant, it must open downwards. Thus  the  equation  is  of
the form x2 = – 4ay.

Since the parabola passes through ( 2,–3), we have

10. 5 Ellipse

Definition 4 An ellipse is the set of all points in
a plane, the sum of whose distances from two
fixed points in the plane is a constant.

The two fixed points are called the foci (plural
of ‘focus’) of the ellipse (Fig10.20).

ANote  The constant which is the sum of
the distances of a point on the ellipse from the
two fixed points is always greater than the Fig 10.20

distance between the two fixed points.

The mid point of the line segment joining the foci is called the centre of the
ellipse.  The line segment through the foci of the ellipse is called the major axis and the

line segment through the centre and perpendicular to the major axis is called the minor
axis.  The end points of the major axis are called the vertices of the ellipse(Fig 10.21).

Fig 10.21 Fig 10.22

We denote the length of the major axis by 2a, the length of the minor axis by 2b

and the distance between the foci by 2c.  Thus, the length of the semi major axis is a
and semi-minor axis is b (Fig10.22).

of the ellipse to one of the foci and to one of the vertices of the ellipse (eccentricity is

Then since the focus is at a distance of c from the centre, in terms of the eccentricity
the focus is at a distance of ae from the centre.

These two equations are known as standard equations of the ellipses.

ANote  The standard equations of  ellipses have centre at the origin and the

major and minor axis are coordinate axes. However, the study of the ellipses with
centre at any other point, and any line through the centre as major and the minor
axes passing through the centre and perpendicular to major axis are beyond the
scope here.

From the standard equations of the ellipses (Fig10.24), we have the following
observations:

1. Ellipse is symmetric with respect to both the coordinate axes since if
(x, y) is a point on the ellipse, then (– x, y), (x, –y) and (– x, –y) are also points on
the ellipse.

2. The foci  always lie on the major axis.  The major axis can be determined by
finding the intercepts on the axes of symmetry.  That is, major axis is along the x-axis
if the coefficient of x2 has the larger denominator and it is along the y-axis if the
coefficient of  y2 has the larger denominator.

The term “difference” that is used in the definition means the distance to the

farther point  minus the distance to the closer point. The two fixed points are called the
foci of the hyperbola. The mid-point of the line segment joining the foci is called the

centre of the hyperbola. The line through the foci is called the transverse axis and
the line through the centre and perpendicular to the transverse axis is called the conjugate

axis. The points at which the hyperbola
intersects the transverse axis are called the

vertices of the hyperbola (Fig 10.27).
We denote the distance between the

two foci by 2c, the distance between two
vertices (the length of the transverse axis)

by 2a and we define the quantity b as

b  = 2 2
c – a

Also 2b is the length of the conjugate axis

hyperbolas with any two perpendicular lines as transverse and conjugate axes, but
the study of such cases will be dealt in higher classes.

From the standard equations of hyperbolas (Fig10.27), we have the following
observations:

1. Hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both the axes, since if (x, y) is a point on
the hyperbola, then (– x, y), (x, – y) and (– x, – y) are also points on the hyperbola.

Historical Note

Geometry is one of the most ancient branches of mathematics. The Greek
geometers investigated the properties of many curves that have theoretical and
practical importance. Euclid wrote his treatise on geometry around 300 B.C. He
was the first who organised the geometric figures based on certain axioms
suggested by physical considerations. Geometry as initially studied by the ancient
Indians and Greeks, who made essentially no use of the process of algebra. The
synthetic approach to the subject of geometry as given by Euclid and in
Sulbasutras, etc., was continued for some 1300 years. In the 200 B.C., Apollonius
wrote a book called ‘The Conic’ which was all about conic sections with many
important discoveries that have remained unsurpassed for eighteen centuries.

Modern analytic geometry is called ‘Cartesian’ after the name of Rene
Descartes (1596-1650) whose relevant ‘La Geometrie’ was published in 1637.
But the fundamental principle and method of analytical geometry were already
discovered by Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Unfortunately, Fermats treatise on
the subject, entitled Ad Locus Planos et So LIDOS Isagoge (Introduction to
Plane and Solid Loci) was published only posthumously in
1679. So, Descartes came to be regarded as the unique inventor of the analytical
geometry.

Isaac Barrow avoided using cartesian method. Newton used method of
undetermined coefficients to find equations of curves. He used several types of
coordinates including polar and bipolar. Leibnitz used the terms ‘abscissa’,
‘ordinate’ and ‘coordinate’. L’ Hospital (about 1700) wrote an important textbook
on analytical geometry.

Clairaut (1729) was the first to give the distance formula although in clumsy
form. He also gave the intercept form of the linear equation. Cramer (1750)

CONIC SECTIONS       207

made formal use of the two axes and gave the equation of a circle as
( y – a)2 + (b – x)2 = r

He gave the best exposition of the analytical geometry of his time. Monge
(1781) gave the modern ‘point-slope’ form of equation of a line as

y – y′ = a (x – x′)
and the condition of perpendicularity of two lines as aa′ + 1 = 0.
S.F. Lacroix (1765–1843) was a prolific textbook writer, but his contributions

to analytical geometry are found scattered. He gave the ‘two-point’ form of
equation of a line as

β′ – β
      y – β = (x – α)

and the length of the perpendicular from (α, β) on y = ax + b as 2

course, surprising that one has to wait for more than 150 years after the invention
of analytical geometry before finding such essential basic formula. In 1818, C.
Lame, a civil engineer, gave mE + m′E′ = 0 as the curve passing through the
points of intersection of two loci E = 0 and E′ = 0.

Many important discoveries, both in Mathematics and Science, have been
linked to the conic sections. The Greeks particularly Archimedes (287–212 B.C.)
and Apollonius (200 B.C.) studied conic sections for their own beauty. These
curves are important tools for present day exploration of outer space and also for
research into behaviour of atomic particles.

11.1  Introduction

You may recall that to locate the position of a point in a
plane, we need two intersecting mutually perpendicular lines
in the plane. These lines are called the coordinate axes
and the two numbers are called the coordinates of the
point with respect to the axes. In actual life, we do not
have to deal with points lying in a plane only. For example,
consider the position of a ball thrown in space at different
points of time or the position of an aeroplane as it flies
from one place to another at different times during its flight.

Similarly, if we were to locate the position of the Leonhard Euler

lowest tip of an electric bulb hanging from the ceiling of a (1707-1783)

room or the position of the central tip of the ceiling fan in a room, we will not only
require the perpendicular distances of the point to be located from two perpendicular
walls of the room but also the height of the point from the floor of the room. Therefore,
we need not only two but three numbers representing the perpendicular distances of
the point from three mutually perpendicular planes, namely the floor of the room and
two adjacent walls of the room. The three numbers representing the three distances
are called the coordinates of the point with reference to the three coordinate
planes. So, a point in space has three coordinates. In this Chapter, we shall study the
basic concepts of geometry in three dimensional space.*

11.2  Coordinate Axes and Coordinate Planes in Three Dimensional Space

Consider three planes intersecting at a point O
such that these three planes are mutually
perpendicular to each other (Fig 11.1). These
three planes intersect along the lines X′OX, Y′OY
and Z′OZ, called the x, y and z-axes, respectively.
We may note that these lines are mutually
perpendicular to each other. These lines constitute
the rectangular coordinate system. The planes
XOY, YOZ and ZOX, called, respectively the
XY-plane, YZ-plane and the ZX-plane, are
known as the three coordinate planes. We take

Fig 11.1
the XOY plane as the plane of the paper and the
line Z′OZ as perpendicular to the plane XOY. If the plane of the paper is considered
as horizontal, then the line Z′OZ will be vertical. The distances measured from
XY-plane upwards in the direction of OZ are taken as positive and those measured
downwards in the direction of OZ′ are taken as negative. Similarly, the distance
measured to the right of ZX-plane along OY are taken as positive, to the left of
ZX-plane and along OY′ as negative, in front of the YZ-plane along OX as positive
and to the back of it along OX′ as negative. The point O is called the origin of the
coordinate system. The three coordinate planes divide the space into eight parts known
as octants. These octants could be named as XOYZ, X′OYZ, X′OY′Z, XOY′Z,  XOYZ′,
X′OYZ′, X′OY′Z′ and XOY′Z′. and denoted by I, II, III, ..., VIII , respectively.

11.3  Coordinates of a Point in Space

Having chosen a fixed coordinate system in the
space, consisting of coordinate axes, coordinate
planes and the origin, we now explain, as to how,
given a point in the space, we associate with it three
coordinates (x,y,z) and conversely, given a triplet
of three numbers (x, y, z), how, we locate a point in
the space.

Given a point P in space, we drop a
perpendicular PM on the XY-plane with M as the Fig 11.2

foot of this perpendicular (Fig 11.2). Then, from the point M, we draw a perpendicular
ML to the x-axis, meeting it at L. Let OL be x, LM be y and MP be z. Then x,y and z
are called the x, y and z coordinates, respectively, of the point P in the space. In
Fig 11.2, we may note that the point P (x, y, z) lies in the octant XOYZ and so all x, y,
z are positive. If P was in any other octant, the signs of x, y and z would change

Reprint 2025-26



210 MATHEMATICS

accordingly. Thus, to each point P in the space there corresponds an ordered triplet
(x, y, z) of real numbers.

Conversely, given any triplet (x, y, z), we would first fix the point L on the x-axis
corresponding to x, then locate the point M in the XY-plane such that (x, y) are the
coordinates of the point M in the XY-plane. Note that LM is perpendicular to the
x-axis or is parallel to the y-axis. Having reached the point M, we draw a perpendicular
MP to the XY-plane and locate on it the point P corresponding to z. The point P so
obtained has then the coordinates (x, y, z). Thus, there is a one to one correspondence
between the points in space and ordered triplet (x, y, z) of real numbers.

Alternatively, through the point P in the
space, we draw three planes parallel to the
coordinate planes, meeting the x-axis, y-axis
and z-axis in the points A, B and C, respectively
(Fig 11.3). Let OA = x, OB = y and OC = z.
Then, the point P will have the coordinates x, y
and z and we write P (x, y, z). Conversely, given
x, y and z, we locate the three points A, B and
C on the three coordinate axes. Through the
points A, B and C we draw planes parallel to
the YZ-plane, ZX-plane and XY-plane, Fig 11.3

respectively. The point of interesection of these three planes, namely, ADPF, BDPE
and CEPF is obviously the point P, corresponding to the ordered triplet (x, y, z). We
observe that if P (x, y, z) is any point in the space, then x, y and z are perpendicular
distances from YZ, ZX and XY planes, respectively.

ANote  The coordinates of the origin O are (0,0,0). The coordinates of any point

on the x-axis will be as (x,0,0) and the coordinates of any point in the YZ-plane will
be as (0, y, z).

Remark  The sign of the coordinates of a point determine the octant in which the
point lies. The following table shows the signs of the coordinates in eight octants.

11.4  Distance between Two Points

We have studied about the distance
between two points in two-dimensional
coordinate system. Let us now extend this
study to three-dimensional system.

Let P(x , y , z ) and Q ( x , y , z )
1 1 1 2 2 2

be two points referred to a system of
rectangular axes OX, OY and OZ.
Through the points P and Q draw planes
parallel to the coordinate planes so as to
form a rectangular parallelopiped with one
diagonal PQ (Fig 11.4).

Now, since ∠PAQ is a right
Fig 11.4

angle, it follows that, in triangle PAQ,

     PQ2 = PA2 + AQ2 . . .  (1)

Also,  triangle ANQ is right angle triangle with ∠ANQ a right angle.

Reprint 2025-26



212 MATHEMATICS

Therefore AQ2 = AN2 + NQ2 ... (2)
From (1) and (2), we have

PQ2 = PA2 + AN2 + NQ2

Now PA = y  – y , AN = x  – x  and NQ = z – z
2 1 2 1 2 1

Hence PQ2 = (x  – x )2 + (y  – y )  + (z  – z )2

2 1 2 1 2 1

Therefore PQ = (x 2 2 2
2−x1) +(y2−y1) +(z2−z1)

This gives us the distance between two points (x , y , z ) and (x , y , z ).

which gives the distance between the origin O and any point Q (x , y , z ).

Example 3 Find the distance between the points P(1, –3, 4) and Q (– 4, 1, 2).

PQ = ( 4 1)2 2

Example 4 Show that the points P (–2, 3, 5), Q (1, 2, 3) and R (7, 0, –1) are collinear.

Solution We know that points are said to be collinear if they lie on a line.

Now, PQ = (1+ 2)2 (2 3)2 (3 5)2
+ − + − = 9 +1+ 4 = 14

QR = (7 −1)2 (0 2)2 (−1− 3)2

and PR = (7 + 2)2 (0 3)2 ( 1 5)2
+ − + − − = 81+ 9 + 36 = 126 = 3 14

Thus, PQ + QR = PR. Hence, P, Q and R are collinear.

Example 5 Are the points A (3, 6, 9), B (10, 20, 30) and C (25, – 41, 5), the vertices
of a right angled triangle?

Solution By the distance formula, we have
AB2 = (10 – 3)2 + (20 – 6)2 + (30 – 9)2

= 49 + 196 + 441 = 686

BC2 = (25 – 10)2 + (– 41 – 20)2 + (5 – 30)2

CA2 = (3 – 25)2 + (6 + 41)2 + (9 – 5)2

= 484 + 2209 + 16 = 2709

We find that    CA2 + AB2 ≠ BC2.

Hence, the triangle ABC is not a right angled triangle.

Example 6   Find the equation of set of points P such that PA2 + PB2 = 2k2, where
A and B are the points (3, 4, 5) and (–1, 3, –7), respectively.

Solution  Let the coordinates of point P be (x, y, z).
Here PA2  = (x – 3)2 + (y – 4)2 + ( z – 5)2

PB2  = (x + 1)2 + (y – 3)2 + (z + 7)2

By the given condition PA2 + PB2 = 2k2, we have

(x – 3)2 + (y – 4)2 + (z – 5)2 + (x + 1)2 + (y – 3)2 + (z + 7)2 = 2k2
 

i.e., 2x2 + 2y2 + 2z2 – 4x – 14y + 4z = 2k2 – 109.

Historical Note

Rene’ Descartes (1596–1650), the father of analytical geometry, essentially dealt
with plane geometry only in 1637. The same is true of his co-inventor Pierre
Fermat (1601-1665) and La Hire (1640-1718). Although suggestions for the three
dimensional coordinate geometry can be found in their works but no details.
Descartes had the idea of coordinates in three dimensions but did not develop it.
J.Bernoulli (1667-1748) in a letter of 1715  to Leibnitz introduced the three coor-
dinate planes which we use today. It was Antoinne Parent
(1666-1716), who gave a systematic development of analytical solid geometry
for the first time in a paper presented to the French Academy in 1700.
L.Euler (1707-1783) took up systematically the three dimensional coordinate ge-
ometry, in Chapter 5 of the appendix to the second volume of his “Introduction
to Geometry” in 1748.
It was not until the middle of the nineteenth century that geometry was extended
to more than three dimensions, the well-known application of which is  in the
Space-Time Continuum of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity.

LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES

vWith the Calculus as a key, Mathematics can be successfully applied to the
explanation of the course of Nature – WHITEHEAD v

12.1  Introduction

This chapter is an introduction to Calculus. Calculus is that
branch of mathematics which mainly deals with the study
of change in the value of a function as the points in the
domain change. First, we give an intuitive idea of derivative
(without actually defining it). Then we give a naive definition
of limit and study some algebra of limits. Then we come
back to a definition of derivative and study some algebra
of derivatives. We also obtain derivatives of certain
standard functions.

12.2  Intuitive Idea of Derivatives Sir Issac Newton

Physical experiments have confirmed that the body dropped (1642-1727)

from a tall cliff covers a distance of 4.9t2 metres in t seconds,
i.e., distance s in metres covered by the body as a function of time t in seconds is given
by s = 4.9t2.

The adjoining Table 13.1 gives the distance travelled in metres at various intervals
of time in seconds of a body dropped from a tall cliff.

The objective is to find the veloctiy of the body at time t = 2 seconds from this
data. One way to approach this problem is to find the average velocity for various
intervals of time ending at t = 2 seconds and hope that these throw some light on the
velocity at t = 2 seconds.

Average velocity between t = t  and t = t  equals distance travelled between
1 2

 t = t  and t = t seconds divided by  (t  – t ). Hence the average velocity in the first

From Table 12.2, we observe that the average velocity is gradually increasing.
As we make the time intervals ending at t = 2 smaller, we see that we get a better idea
of the velocity at t = 2. Hoping that nothing really dramatic happens between 1.99
seconds and 2 seconds, we conclude that the average velocity at t = 2 seconds is just
above 19.551m/s.

This conclusion is somewhat strengthened by the following set of computation.
Compute the average velocities for various time intervals starting at t = 2 seconds. As

The following Table 12.3 gives the average velocity v in metres per second

Here again we note that if we take smaller time intervals starting at t = 2, we get
better idea of the velocity at t = 2.

In the first set of computations, what we have done is to find average velocities
in increasing time intervals ending at t = 2 and then hope that nothing dramatic happens
just before t = 2. In the second set of computations, we have found the average velocities
decreasing in time intervals ending at t = 2 and then hope that nothing dramatic happens
just after t = 2. Purely on the physical grounds, both these sequences of average
velocities must approach a common limit. We can safely conclude that the velocity of
the body at t = 2 is between 19.551m/s and 19.649 m/s. Technically, we say that the
instantaneous velocity at t = 2 is between 19.551 m/s and 19.649 m/s. As is
well-known, velocity is the rate of change of displacement. Hence what we have
accomplished is the following. From the given data of distance covered at various time
instants we have estimated the rate of
change of the distance at a given instant
of time. We say that the derivative of
the distance function s = 4.9t2 at t = 2
is between 19.551 and 19.649.

An alternate way of viewing this
limiting process is shown in Fig 12.1.
This is a plot of distance s of the body
from the top of the cliff versus the time
t elapsed. In the limit as the sequence
of time intervals h , h , ..., approaches

zero, the sequence of average velocities
approaches the same limit as does the
sequence of ratios Fig 12.1

etc. From the Fig 12.1 it is safe to conclude that this latter sequence approaches the
slope of the tangent to the curve at point A. In other words, the instantaneous velocity
v(t) of a body at time t = 2 is equal to the slope of the tangent of the curve s = 4.9t2 at
t = 2.

12.3 Limits

The above discussion clearly points towards the fact that we need to understand limit-
ing process in greater clarity. We study a few illustrative examples to gain some famil-
iarity with the concept of limits.

Consider the function f(x) = x2. Observe that as x takes values very close to 0,
the value of f(x) also moves towards 0 (See Fig 2.10 Chapter 2). We say

lim f (x) = 0
x→0

(to be read as limit of f (x) as x tends to zero equals zero).  The limit of f (x) as x tends
to zero is to be thought of as the value f (x) should assume at x = 0.

In general as x → a, f (x) → l, then l is called limit of the function f (x) which is

symbolically written as lim f (x) = l .
x→a

Consider the following function g(x) = |x|, x ≠ 0. Observe that g(0) is not defined.
Computing the value of g(x) for values of x very
near to 0, we see that the value of g(x) moves

towards 0. So, lim
x→  g(x) = 0. This is intuitively

0

clear from the graph of y = |x| for x ≠ 0.
(See Fig 2.13, Chapter 2).

Consider the following function.

2

( x − 4
h x) = , x ≠ 2 .

x − 2

Compute the value of h(x) for values  of
x very near to 2 (but not at 2). Convince yourself
that all these values are near to 4. This is
somewhat strengthened by considering the graph
of the function y = h(x) given here (Fig 12.2). Fig 12.2

  LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES            221

In all these illustrations the value which the function should assume at a given
point x = a did not really depend on how is x tending to a. Note that there are essentially
two ways x could approach a number a  either from left or from right, i.e., all the
values of x near a could be less than a or could be greater than a. This naturally leads
to two limits – the right hand limit and the left hand limit. Right hand limit of a
function f(x) is that value of f(x) which is dictated by the values of f(x) when x tends
to a from the right. Similarly, the left hand limit. To illustrate this, consider the function

( ) 1, x ≤ 0
f x = 

2, x > 0

Graph of this function is shown in the Fig 12.3. It is
clear that the value of f at 0 dictated by values of f(x) with
x ≤ 0 equals 1, i.e., the left hand limit of f (x) at 0 is

lim f (x)=1
x→ .

0

Similarly, the value of f at 0 dictated by values of
f (x) with x > 0 equals 2, i.e., the right hand limit of f (x)
at 0 is

lim f (x) = 2 .
x→0+

Fig 12.3

In this case the right and left hand limits are different, and hence we say that the
limit of f (x) as x tends to zero does not exist (even though the function is defined at 0).

Summary

  We say lim
x→ –  f(x) is the expected value of  f at x = a given the values of f near

a

x to the left of a. This value is called the left hand limit of f at a.

We say lim f (x)  s t e e p c e  a u  f f
→ + i  h  x e t d v l e o   at x = a given the values of

x a

f near x to the right of a. This value is called the right hand limit of f(x) at a.
If the right and left hand limits coincide, we call that common value as the limit

of f(x) at x = a and denote it by lim
x→  f(x).

Illustration 1 Consider the function f(x) = x + 10. We want to find the limit of this
function at x = 5. Let us compute the value of the function f(x) for x very near to 5.
Some   of the points near and to the left of 5 are 4.9, 4.95, 4.99, 4.995. . ., etc. Values
of the function at these points are tabulated below. Similarly, the real number 5.001,

222 MATHEMATICS

5.01, 5.1 are also points near and to the right of 5. Values of the function at these points
are also given in the Table 12.4.

Table 12.4

x 4.9 4.95 4.99 4.995 5.001 5.01 5.1

f(x) 14.9 14.95 14.99 14.995 15.001 15.01 15.1

From the Table 12.4, we deduce that value of f(x) at x = 5 should be greater than
14.995 and less than 15.001 assuming nothing dramatic happens between x = 4.995
and 5.001. It is reasonable to assume that the value of the f(x) at x = 5 as dictated by
the numbers to the left of 5 is 15, i.e.,

lim f ( x) =15 .
x→5–

Similarly, when x approaches 5 from the right,  f(x) should be taking value 15, i.e.,

lim f (x) =15 .
x→5+

Hence, it is likely that the left hand limit of f(x) and the right hand limit of f(x) are
both equal to 15. Thus,

lim f (x) = lim f (x) = lim f (x) =15
x→5− .

x→5+ x→5

This conclusion about the limit being equal to 15 is somewhat strengthened by
seeing the graph of this function which is given in Fig 2.16, Chapter 2. In this figure, we
note that as x approaches 5 from either right or left, the graph of the function
f(x) = x +10 approaches the point (5, 15).

We observe that the value of the function at x = 5 also happens to be equal to 15.

Illustration 2 Consider the function f(x) = x3. Let us try to find the limit of this
function at x = 1. Proceeding as in the previous case, we tabulate the value of f(x) at
x near 1. This is given in the Table 12.5.

0.997002999 and less than 1.003003001 assuming nothing dramatic happens between

  LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES            223

x = 0.999 and 1.001. It is reasonable to assume that the value of the f(x) at x = 1 as
dictated by the numbers to the left of 1 is 1, i.e.,

lim f (x) =1.
x→1−

Similarly, when x approaches 1 from the right, f(x) should be taking value 1, i.e.,

lim f (x) =1.
x→1+

Hence, it is likely that the left hand limit of f(x) and the right hand limit of f(x) are
both equal to 1. Thus,

lim f (x) = lim f (x) = lim f (x) =1 .
x→1− x→1+ x→1

This conclusion about the limit being equal to 1 is somewhat strengthened by
seeing the graph of this function which is given in Fig 2.11, Chapter 2. In this figure, we
note that as x approaches 1 from either right or left, the graph of the function
f(x) = x3 approaches the point (1, 1).

We observe, again, that the value of the function at x = 1 also happens to be
equal to 1.

Illustration 3 Consider the function f(x) = 3x. Let us try to find the limit of this
function at x = 2. The following Table 12.6 is now self-explanatory.

Table 12.6

x 1.9 1.95 1.99 1.999 2.001 2.01 2.1

f(x) 5.7 5.85 5.97 5.997 6.003 6.03 6.3

As before we observe that as x  approaches 2
from either left or right, the value of f(x) seem to
approach 6. We record this as

lim f (x) = lim f (x) = lim f (x) = 6
x→2− x→2+ x→2

Its graph shown in Fig 12.4 strengthens this
fact.

Here again we note that the value of the function
at x = 2 coincides with the limit at x = 2.

Illustration 4 Consider the constant function
f(x) = 3. Let us try to find its limit at x = 2. This
function being the constant function takes the same Fig 12.4

lim f (x) = lim f (x) = lim f (x) = 3
x→2 x→2+ x→2

Graph of f(x) = 3 is anyway the line parallel to x-axis passing through (0, 3) and
is shown in Fig 2.9, Chapter 2. From this also it is clear that the required limit is 3. In

fact, it is easily observed that lim f (x) = 3  for any real number a.

Illustration 5 Consider the function f(x) = x2 + x. We want to find lim f (x) . We

From this it is reasonable to deduce that

From the graph of f(x) = x2 + x
shown in the Fig 12.5,  it is clear that as x

Here, observe that the domain of the function is given to be all positive real
numbers. Hence, when we tabulate the values of f(x), it does not make sense to talk of
x approaching 0 from the left. Below we tabulate the values of the function for positive
x close to 0 (in this table n denotes any positive integer).

From the Table 12.10 given below, we see that as x tends to 0, f(x) becomes
larger and larger. What we mean here is that the value of f(x) may be made larger than
any given number.

From the last three entires of the table we deduce that the value of the function
is increasing from 2 and hence

Since the left and right hand limits at 0 do not coincide,
we say that the limit of the function at 0 does not exist.

  Graph of this function is given in the Fig12.6. Here,
we remark that the value of the function at x = 0 is well
defined and is, indeed, equal to 0, but the limit of the function
at x = 0 is not even defined.

As usual we tabulate the values of f(x) for x near 1. From the values of f(x) for
x less than 1, it seems that the function should take value 3 at x = 1., i.e.,

lim f (x) = 3 .

Similarly, the value of f(x) should be 3 as dic-

note that  in general, at a given point the value of the function and its limit may be
different (even when both are defined).

12.3.1  Algebra of limits In the above illustrations, we have observed that the limiting
process respects addition, subtraction, multiplication and division as long as the limits
and functions under consideration are well defined. This is not a coincidence. In fact,
below we formalise these as a theorem without proof.

Then

  (i) Limit of sum of two functions is sum of the limits of the functions, i.e.,

lim [f(x) + g (x)] =  lim  f(x) +  lim  g(x).
x→a x→a x→a

 (ii) Limit of difference of two functions is difference of the limits of the functions, i.e.,

lim [f(x) – g(x)] =  lim  f(x) –  lim  g(x).
x→a x→a x→a

(iii) Limit of product of two functions is product of the limits of the functions, i.e.,

lim  [f(x) . g(x)] =  lim  f(x).  lim  g(x).

(iv) Limit of quotient of two functions is quotient of the limits of the functions (whenever
the denominator is non zero), i.e.,

f (x) lim f (x)
lim = x→a

x→a g (x) lim g (x)

such that  g(x) = λ , for some real number λ , we have

limits of special types of functions.

12.4 Limits of Trigonometric Functions
The following facts (stated as theorems) about functions in general come in handy in
calculating limits of some trigonometric functions.

Theorem 3 Let f and g be two real valued functions with the same domain such that

f (x) ≤ g( x) for all x in the domain of definition, For some a, if both lim  f(x) and
x→a

lim  g(x) exist, then lim  f(x) ≤ lim  g(x). This is illustrated in Fig 12.8.

f (x) ≤ g( x) ≤ h(x) for all x in the common domain of definition. For some real number

a, if lim   f(x) = l = lim  h(x), then lim  g(x) = l. This is illustrated in Fig 12.9.

12.5  Derivatives

We have seen in the Section 13.2, that by knowing the position of a body at various
time intervals it is possible to find the rate at which the position of the body is changing.
It is of very general interest to know a certain parameter at various instants of time and
try to finding the rate at which it is changing. There are several real life situations
where such a process needs to be carried out. For instance, people maintaining a
reservoir need to know when will a reservoir overflow knowing the depth of the water
at several instances of time, Rocket Scientists need to compute the precise velocity
with which the satellite needs to be shot out from the rocket knowing the height of the
rocket at various times. Financial institutions need to predict the changes in the value of
a particular stock knowing its present value. In these, and many such cases it is desirable
to know how a particular parameter is changing with respect to some other parameter.
The heart of the matter is derivative of a function at a given point in its domain
of definition.

Definition 1 Suppose f is a real valued function and a is a point in its domain of
definition. The derivative of  f  at a is defined by

f (a + h) − f (a)
lim
h→0 h

provided this limit exists. Derivative of f (x) at a is denoted by f′(a).
Observe that f′ (a) quantifies the change in  f(x) at a with respect to x.

Remark At this stage note that evaluating derivative at a point involves effective use
of various rules, limits are subjected to. The following illustrates this.

Example 7 Find the derivative of sin x at x = 0.

Solution Let f(x) = sin x. Then

f (0 + h) − f (0)
f ′(0) = lim

sin (0 + h) − sin (0) sin h

h→0 h h→0 h

Example 8 Find the derivative of f(x) = 3 at x = 0 and at x = 3.

Solution Since the derivative measures the change in function, intuitively it is clear
that the derivative of the constant function must be zero at every point. This is indeed,
supported by the following computation.

f (0 + h) − f (0)
( 3 − 3 0

f ' 0) = lim = lim = lim = 0 .

ric interpretation of derivative of a
function at a point. Let y = f(x) be
a function and let P = (a, f(a)) and
Q = (a + h, f(a + h) be two points
close to each other on the graph
of this function. The Fig 12.11 is
now self explanatory.

f
We know that  ( ) (a + h) − f (a)

f ′ a = lim
h→0 h

From the triangle PQR, it is clear that the ratio whose limit we are taking is
precisely equal to tan(QPR) which is the slope of the chord PQ. In the limiting process,
as h tends to 0, the point Q tends to P and we have

f (a + h) − f (a) QR
lim = lim
h→0 h Q→P PR

This is equivalent to the fact that the chord PQ tends to the tangent at P of the
curve y = f(x). Thus the limit turns out to be equal to the slope of the tangent. Hence

f ′(a) = tanψ .

For a given function f  we can find the derivative at every point. If the derivative
exists at every point, it defines a new function called the derivative of f . Formally, we
define derivative of a function as follows.

Definition 2 Suppose f  is a real valued function, the function defined by

f (x + h) − f (x)
lim
h→0 h

wherever the limit exists is defined to be the derivative of f at x and is denoted by
f′(x). This definition of derivative is also called the first principle of derivative.

f x + h − f x
Thus f '(x) ( ) ( )

= lim

Clearly the domain of definition of f′ (x) is wherever the above limit exists. There
are different notations for derivative of a function. Sometimes f′ (x) is denoted by

d ( ( dy

12.5.1 Algebra of derivative of functions  Since the very definition of derivatives
involve limits in a rather direct fashion, we expect the rules for derivatives to follow
closely that of limits. We collect these in the following theorem.

Theorem 5 Let f and g be two functions such that their derivatives are defined in a
common domain. Then

(i) Derivative of sum of two functions is sum of the derivatives of the
functions.

(ii) Derivative of difference of two functions is difference of the derivatives of
the functions.

d ( ) ( ) d d

dx dx dx

(iii) Derivative of product of two functions is given by the following product
rule.

d ( ) ( d d
 f x . g x) = f (x) . g(x) + f (x) . g(x)

dx dx dx

(iv) Derivative of quotient of two functions is given by the following quotient
rule (whenever the denominator is non–zero).

d d
f (x) . g(x) − f (x) g(x)

d  f (x) 
= dx dx

 
dx  g(x) ( )2

 g(x)

The proofs of these follow essentially from the analogous theorem for limits. We
will not prove these here. As in the case of limits this theorem tells us how to compute
derivatives of special types of functions. The last two statements in the theorem may
be restated in the following fashion which aids in recalling them easily:

Let u = f (x)  and v = g (x). Then

(uv)′  = u′v + uv′

This is referred to a Leibnitz rule for differentiating product of functions or the
product rule. Similarly, the quotient rule is

Now, let us tackle derivatives of some standard functions.
It is easy to see that the derivative of the function f(x) = x is the constant

f (x + h) − f (x) x + h − x
function 1. This is because f ′( x)= lim  = lim

h→0 h h→0 h

= lim1=1 .
h→0

We use this and the above theorem to compute the derivative of
f(x) = 10x = x + .... + x (ten terms). By (i) of the above theorem

df (x) d
      =  (x + ...+ x)  (ten terms)

dx dx

d d
= x + . . .+ x   (ten terms)

dx dx

= 1+ ...+1  (ten terms) = 10.

We note that this limit may be evaluated using product rule too. Write
f(x) = 10x = uv, where u is the constant function taking value 10 everywhere and
v(x) = x. Here, f(x) = 10x = uv we know that the derivative of u equals 0. Also
derivative of v(x) = x equals 1. Thus by the product rule we have

f ′(x)  = (10x)′ = (uv)′ = u′v + uv′ = 0.x +10.1=10

On similar lines the derivative of f(x) = x2 may be evaluated. We have
f(x) = x2 = x .x and hence

df d
 = (x. ) d

x = (x) d
.x + x. (x)

dx dx dx dx

= 1.x + x.1= 2x .

More generally, we have the following theorem.

Theorem 6 Derivative of f(x) = xn is nxn – 1 for any positive integer n.

Proof By definition of the derivative function, we have

f x + h − f x ( )n n
x + h − x

Alternatively, we may also prove this by induction on n and the product rule as
follows. The result is true for n = 1, which has been proved earlier. We have

d ( d

= 1.xn + x.((n −1) xn− )  (by induction hypothesis)

= xn−1 + (n −1) xn−1 = nxn−1 .

Remark The above theorem is true for all powers of x, i.e., n can be any real number
(but we will not prove it here).

12.5.2  Derivative of polynomials and trigonometric functions  We start with the
following theorem which tells us the derivative of a polynomial function.

Theorem 7 Let f(x) = a xn n 1
n + an 1x −

− + ....+ a1x + a  be a polynomial function, where
0

a s are all real numbers and a  ≠  0. Then, the derivative function is given by
i n

df (x)
= na xn−1 + (n −1)a xx−2

n n−1 + ...+  2a x + a
dx 2 1 .

Proof of this theorem is just putting together part (i) of Theorem 5 and Theorem 6.

Example 13 Compute the derivative of 6x100 – x55 + x.

Solution A direct application of the above theorem tells that the derivative of the

above function is 99 54

Historical Note

In the history of mathematics two names are prominent to share the credit for
inventing calculus, Issac Newton (1642 – 1727) and G.W. Leibnitz (1646 – 1717).
Both of them independently invented calculus around the seventeenth century.
After the advent of calculus many mathematicians contributed for further
development of calculus. The rigorous concept is mainly attributed to the great

Reprint 2025-26



256 MATHEMATICS

mathematicians, A.L. Cauchy, J.L.Lagrange and Karl Weierstrass. Cauchy gave
the foundation of calculus as we have now generally accepted in our textbooks.
Cauchy used D’ Alembert’s limit concept to define the derivative of a function.
Starting with definition of a limit, Cauchy gave examples such as the limit of

sinα ∆ y f (x+ i)− f (x)
 for α = 0. He wrote = ,

∆  and called the limit for
α x i

i → 0, the “function derive’e, y′ for f ′ (x)”.

Before 1900, it was thought that calculus is quite difficult to teach. So calculus
became beyond the reach of youngsters. But just in 1900, John Perry and others
in England started propagating the view that essential ideas and methods of calculus
were simple and could be taught even in schools. F.L. Griffin, pioneered the
teaching of calculus to first year students. This was regarded as one of the most
daring act in those days.

Today not only the mathematics but many other subjects such as Physics,
Chemistry, Economics and Biological Sciences are enjoying the fruits of calculus.

STATISTICS

v“Statistics may be rightly called the science of averages and their

estimates.” – A.L.BOWLEY & A.L. BODDINGTON v

13.1  Introduction

We know that statistics deals with data collected for specific
purposes. We can make decisions about the data by
analysing and interpreting it. In earlier classes, we have
studied methods of representing data graphically and in
tabular form. This representation reveals certain salient
features or characteristics of the data. We have also studied
the methods of finding a representative value for the given
data. This value is called the measure of central tendency.
Recall mean (arithmetic mean), median and mode are three
measures of central tendency. A measure of central
tendency gives us a rough idea where data points are Karl Pearson

 (1857-1936)
centred. But, in order to make better interpretation from the
data, we should also have an idea how the data are scattered or how much they are
bunched around a measure of central tendency.

Consider now the runs scored by two batsmen in their last ten matches as follows:

Batsman A : 30, 91,  0, 64, 42, 80, 30, 5, 117,  71
Batsman B : 53, 46, 48, 50, 53, 53, 58, 60, 57, 52

Clearly, the mean and median of the data are

Batsman A Batsman B
Mean 53 53
Median 53 53

Recall that, we calculate the mean of a data (denoted by x ) by dividing the sum
of the observations by the number of observations, i.e.,

Reprint 2025-26



258 MATHEMATICS

x = ∑ xi
n i = 1

Also, the median is obtained by first arranging the data in ascending or descending
order and applying the following rule.

If the number of observations is odd, then the median is     observation.
 2 

If the number of observations is even, then median is  the mean of    and
 2 

th
 n

+ 
 1  observations.
 2 

We find that the mean and median of the runs scored by both the batsmen A and
B are same i.e., 53. Can we say that the performance of two players is same? Clearly
No, because the variability in the scores of batsman A is from 0 (minimum) to 117
(maximum). Whereas, the range of the runs scored by batsman B is from 46 to 60.

Let us now plot the above scores as dots on a number line. We find the following
diagrams:

For batsman A

For batsman B Fig 13.1

Fig 13.2

We can see that the dots corresponding to batsman B are close to each other and
are clustering around the measure of central tendency (mean and median), while those
corresponding to batsman A are scattered or more spread out.

Thus, the measures of central tendency are not sufficient to give complete
information about a given data. Variability is another factor which is required to be
studied under statistics. Like ‘measures of central tendency’ we want to have a
single number to describe variability. This single number is called a ‘measure of
dispersion’. In this Chapter, we shall learn some of the important measures of dispersion
and their methods of calculation for ungrouped and grouped data.

Reprint 2025-26



  STATISTICS            259

13.2  Measures of Dispersion

The dispersion or scatter in a data is measured on the basis of the observations and the
types of the measure of central tendency, used there. There are following measures of
dispersion:

(i) Range, (ii) Quartile deviation, (iii) Mean deviation, (iv) Standard deviation.

In this Chapter, we shall study all of these measures of dispersion except the
quartile deviation.

13.3 Range

Recall that, in the example of runs scored by two batsmen A and B, we had some idea
of variability in the scores on the basis of minimum and maximum runs in each series.
To obtain a single number for this, we find the difference of maximum and minimum
values of each series. This difference is called the ‘Range’ of the data.

In case of batsman A, Range = 117 – 0 = 117 and for batsman B, Range = 60 – 46 = 14.
Clearly, Range of A > Range of B. Therefore, the scores are scattered or dispersed in
case of A while for B these are close to each other.

Thus, Range of a series = Maximum value – Minimum value.

The range of data gives us a rough idea of variability or scatter but does not tell
about the dispersion of the data from a measure of central tendency. For this purpose,
we need some other measure of variability. Clearly, such measure must depend upon
the difference (or deviation) of the values from the central tendency.

The important measures of dispersion, which depend upon the deviations of the
observations from a central tendency are mean deviation and standard deviation. Let
us discuss them in detail.

13.4 Mean Deviation

Recall that the deviation of an observation x from a fixed value ‘a’ is the difference
x – a. In order to find the dispersion of values of x from a central value ‘a’ , we find the
deviations about a. An absolute measure of dispersion is the mean of these deviations.
To find the mean, we must obtain the sum of the deviations. But, we know that a
measure of central tendency lies between the maximum and the minimum values of
the set of observations. Therefore, some of the deviations will be negative and some
positive. Thus, the sum of deviations may vanish. Moreover, the sum of the deviations
from mean ( x ) is zero.

Sum of deviations 0
Also Mean of deviations = = = 0

Number of observations n

Thus, finding the mean of deviations about  mean is not of any use for us, as far
as the measure of dispersion is concerned.

Reprint 2025-26



260 MATHEMATICS

Remember that, in finding a suitable measure of dispersion, we require the distance
of each value from a central tendency or a fixed number ‘a’. Recall, that the absolute
value of the difference of two numbers gives the distance between the numbers when
represented on a number line. Thus, to find the measure of dispersion from a fixed
number ‘a’ we may take the mean of the absolute values of the deviations from the
central value. This mean is called the ‘mean deviation’. Thus mean deviation about a
central value ‘a’  is the mean of the absolute values of the deviations of the observations
from ‘a’. The mean deviation from ‘a’ is denoted as M.D. (a). Therefore,

Sum of absolute values of deviations from 'a'
M.D.(a) = .

Number of observations

Remark  Mean deviation may be obtained from any measure of central tendency.
However, mean deviation from mean and median are commonly used in statistical
studies.

Let us now learn how to calculate mean deviation about mean and mean deviation
about median for various types of data

13.4.1  Mean deviation for ungrouped data  Let  n observations be x , x , x , ...., x .
1 2 3 n

The following steps are involved in the calculation of mean deviation about mean or
median:

Step 1 Calculate the measure of central tendency about which we are to find the mean
deviation. Let it be ‘a’.

Step 2  Find the deviation of each x from a, i.e., x – a, x – a, x – a,. . . , x – a
i 1 2 3 n

Step 3 Find the absolute values of the deviations, i.e., drop the minus sign (–), if it is

there, i.e., x1 − a , x2 − a , x3 − a ,...., xn − a

Step 4 Find the mean of the absolute values of the deviations. This mean is the mean
deviation about a, i.e.,

M.D.(a) = i=1

Thus M.D. ( x ) = ∑ xi − x , where x = Mean

ANote  In this Chapter,  we shall use the symbol M to denote median unless stated
otherwise.Let us now illustrate the steps of the above method in following examples.

Example 1 Find the mean deviation about the mean for the following data:

6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 4, 8, 12

Step 1  Mean of the given data is

(b) Continuous frequency distribution A continuous frequency distribution is a series
in which the data are classified into different class-intervals without gaps alongwith
their respective frequencies.

For example, marks obtained by 100 students are presented in a continuous

distribution, we had made the assumption that the frequency in each class is centred at
its mid-point. Here also, we write the mid-point of each given class and proceed further
as for a discrete frequency distribution to find the mean deviation.

Let us take the following example.

Shortcut method for calculating mean deviation about mean We can avoid the
tedious calculations of computing x by following step-deviation method. Recall that in
this method, we take an assumed mean which is in the middle or just close to it in the
data. Then deviations of the observations (or mid-points of classes) are taken from the

  STATISTICS            267

assumed mean. This is nothing but the shifting of origin from zero to the assumed mean

on the number line, as shown in Fig 13.3

Fig 13.3

If there is a common factor of all the deviations, we divide them by this common

factor to further simplify the deviations. These are known as step-deviations. The

process of taking step-deviations is the change of scale on the number line as shown in

Fig 13.4

Fig 13.4

The deviations and step-deviations reduce the size of the observations, so that the

computations viz. multiplication,  etc., become simpler. Let, the new variable be denoted

(ii) Mean deviation about  median The process of finding the mean deviation about
median for a continuous frequency distribution is similar as we did for mean deviation
about the mean. The only difference lies in the replacement of the mean by median
while taking deviations.

Let us recall the process of finding  median for a continuous frequency distribution.
The data is first arranged in ascending order. Then, the median of continuous

frequency distribution is obtained by first identifying the class in which median lies
(median class) and then applying the formula

13.4.3  Limitations of mean deviation  In a series, where the degree of variability is
very high, the median is not a representative central tendency. Thus, the mean deviation
about median calculated for such series can not be fully relied.

The sum of the deviations from the mean (minus signs ignored) is more than the sum
of the deviations from median. Therefore, the mean deviation about the mean is not very
scientific.Thus, in many cases, mean deviation may give unsatisfactory results. Also mean
deviation is calculated on the basis of absolute values of the deviations and therefore,
cannot be subjected to further algebraic treatment. This implies that we must have some
other measure of dispersion. Standard deviation is such a measure of dispersion.

13.5 Variance and Standard Deviation
Recall that while calculating mean deviation about mean or median, the absolute values
of the deviations were taken. The absolute values were taken to give meaning to the
mean deviation, otherwise the deviations may cancel among themselves.

Another way to overcome this difficulty which arose due to the signs of deviations,
is to take squares of all the deviations. Obviously all these squares of deviations are

If this sum is  zero, then each (xi − x) has to be zero. This implies that there is no

contrary, if this sum is large, there is a higher degree of dispersion of the observations

 is a reasonable indicator

of the degree of dispersion or scatter?
Let us take the set A of six observations 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55. The mean of the

mean of these observations is y = 30

Note that both the sets A and B of observations have a mean of 30.

Now, the sum of squares of  deviations of observations for set B from the mean y  is

If ∑ (xi − x)2
 is simply our measure of dispersion or scatter about mean, we

i=1

will tend to say that the set A of six observations has a lesser dispersion about the mean
than the set B of 31 observations, even though the observations in set A are more
scattered from the mean (the range of deviations being from –25 to 25) than in the set
B (where the range of deviations is from –15 to 15).

This is also clear from the following diagrams.

For the set A, we have

Fig 13.5

For the set B, we have

Fig 13.6

Thus, we can say that the sum of squares of deviations from the mean is not a proper
measure of dispersion. To overcome this difficulty we take the mean of the squares of

1 n

the deviations, i.e., we take ∑ (xi − x)2
. In case of the set A, we have

n i=1

1 1
Mean = × 1750 = 291.67 and in case of the set B, it is × 2480 = 80.

This indicates that the scatter or dispersion is more in set A than  the scatter or dispersion
in set B, which confirms with the geometrical representation of the two sets.

Thus, we can take  ∑ (xi − x)2

as a quantity which leads to a proper measure

of dispersion. This number, i.e., mean of the squares of the deviations from mean is

called the variance and is denoted by σ 2 (read as sigma square). Therefore, the

Historical Note

‘Statistics’ is derived from the Latin word ‘status’ which means a political
state. This suggests that statistics is as old as human civilisation. In the year 3050
B.C., perhaps the first census was held in Egypt. In India also, about 2000 years
ago, we had an efficient system of collecting administrative statistics, particularly,
during the regime of Chandra Gupta Maurya (324-300 B.C.). The system of
collecting data related to births and deaths is mentioned in Kautilya’s Arthshastra
(around 300 B.C.) A detailed account of administrative surveys conducted during
Akbar’s regime is given in Ain-I-Akbari written by Abul Fazl.

Captain John Graunt of London (1620-1674) is known as father of vital
statistics due to his studies on statistics of births and deaths. Jacob Bernoulli
(1654-1705) stated the Law of Large numbers in his book “Ars Conjectandi’,
published in 1713.

288 MATHEMATICS

The theoretical development of statistics came during the mid seventeenth
century and continued after that with the introduction of theory of games and
chance (i.e., probability). Francis Galton (1822-1921), an Englishman, pioneered
the use of statistical methods, in the field of Biometry. Karl Pearson (1857-1936)
contributed a lot to the development of statistical studies with his discovery
of Chi square test and foundation of statistical laboratory in England (1911).
Sir Ronald A. Fisher (1890-1962), known as the Father of modern statistics,
applied it to various diversified fields such as Genetics, Biometry, Education,
Agriculture, etc.

vWhere a mathematical reasoning can be had, it is as great a folly to
make use of any other, as to grope for a thing in the dark, when

you have a candle in your hand. – JOHN ARBUTHNOT v

14.1  Event

We have studied about random experiment and sample space associated with an
experiment. The sample space serves as an universal set for all questions concerned
with the experiment.

Consider the experiment of tossing a coin two times. An associated sample space
is S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}.

Now suppose that we are interested in those outcomes which correspond to the
occurrence of exactly one head. We find that HT and TH are the only elements of S
corresponding to the occurrence of this happening (event). These two elements form
the set  E = { HT, TH}

We know that the set E is a subset of the sample space S . Similarly, we find the
following correspondence between events and subsets of S.

Description of events Corresponding subset of ‘S’
Number of tails is exactly 2 A = {TT}
Number of tails is atleast one B = {HT, TH, TT}
Number of heads is atmost one C = {HT, TH, TT}
Second toss is not head D = { HT, TT}
Number of tails is atmost two S  = {HH, HT, TH, TT}
Number of tails is more than two φ
The above discussion suggests that a subset of sample space is associated with

an event and an event is associated with a subset of sample space. In the light of this
we define an event as follows.

Definition  Any subset E of a sample space S is called an event.

Reprint 2025-26



290 MATHEMATICS

14.1.1  Occurrence of an event  Consider the experiment of throwing a die. Let E
denotes the event “ a number  less than 4 appears”. If actually ‘1’ had appeared on the
die then we say that event E has occurred. As a matter of fact if outcomes are 2 or 3,
we say that event E has occurred

Thus, the event E of a sample space S is said to have occurred if the outcome
ω of the experiment is such that ω ∈ E. If the outcome ω  is such that ω  ∉ E, we say
that the event E has not occurred.

14.1.2  Types of events  Events can be classified into various types on the basis  of the
elements they have.

1. Impossible and Sure Events  The empty set φ and the sample space S describe
events. In fact φ is called an impossible event and S, i.e., the whole sample space is
called the sure event.

To understand these let us consider the experiment of rolling a die. The associated
sample space is

S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Let E be the event “ the number appears on the die is a multiple of 7”. Can you
write the subset associated with the event E?

Clearly no outcome satisfies the condition given in the event, i.e., no element of
the sample space ensures the occurrence of the event E. Thus, we say that the empty
set only correspond to the event E. In other words we can say that it is impossible to

have a multiple of 7 on the upper face of the die. Thus, the event E = φ  is an impossible

event.
Now let us take up another event F “the number turns up is odd or even”. Clearly

F = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,} = S, i.e., all outcomes of the experiment ensure the occurrence of
the event F. Thus, the event F = S is a sure event.

2. Simple Event  If an event E has only one sample point of a sample space, it is
called a simple (or elementary) event.

In a sample space containing n distinct elements, there are exactly n simple
events.

For example in the experiment of tossing two coins, a sample space is

S={HH, HT, TH, TT}

There are four simple events corresponding to this sample space. These are

E = {HH}, E ={HT}, E = { TH} and E ={TT}.

PROBABILITY            291

3. Compound Event  If an event has more than one sample point, it is called  a
Compound event.

For example, in the experiment of “tossing a coin thrice” the events
E: ‘Exactly one head appeared’
F: ‘Atleast one head appeared’
G: ‘Atmost one head appeared’ etc.

are all compound events. The subsets of S associated with these events are
E={HTT,THT,TTH}
F={HTT,THT, TTH, HHT, HTH, THH, HHH}
G= {TTT, THT, HTT, TTH}

Each of the above subsets contain more than one sample point, hence they are all
compound events.

14.1.3  Algebra of events  In the Chapter on Sets, we have studied about different
ways of combining two or more sets, viz, union, intersection, difference, complement
of a set etc. Like-wise we can combine two or more events by using the analogous set
notations.

Let A, B, C be events associated with an experiment whose sample space is S.

1. Complementary Event For every event A, there corresponds another event

A′ called the complementary event to A. It is also called the event ‘not A’.
For example, take the experiment ‘of tossing three coins’. An associated sample

space is
S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}

Let  A={HTH, HHT, THH} be the event ‘only one tail appears’
Clearly for the outcome HTT, the event A has not occurred. But we may say that

the event ‘not A’ has occurred. Thus, with every outcome which is not in A, we say
that ‘not A’ occurs.

Thus the complementary event ‘not A’ to the event A is

A′ = {HHH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}

or A′ = {ω : ω ∈ S and ω ∉A} = S – A.

2. The Event ‘A or B’ Recall that union of two sets A and B denoted by A ∪ B
contains all those elements which are either in A  or in B or in both.

When the sets A and B are two events associated with a sample space, then
‘A ∪ B’ is the event ‘either A or B or both’. This event ‘A ∪ B’ is also called ‘A or B’.

Therefore Event ‘A or B’ = A ∪ B
= {ω : ω ∈ A or ω ∈ B}

3. The Event ‘A and B’ We know that intersection of two sets A ∩ B is the set of
those elements which are common to both A and B. i.e., which belong to both
‘A and B’.
If A and B are two events, then the set A ∩ B denotes the event ‘A and B’.
Thus,       A ∩ B = {ω : ω ∈ A and ω ∈ B}

For example, in the experiment of ‘throwing a die twice’ Let A be the event
‘score on the first throw is six’ and B is the event ‘sum of two scores is atleast 11’ then

A = {(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)}, and  B = {(5,6), (6,5), (6,6)}
so A ∩ B = {(6,5), (6,6)}
Note that the set A ∩ B = {(6,5), (6,6)} may represent the event ‘the score on the first
throw  is six and the sum of the scores is atleast 11’.

4. The Event ‘A but not B’ We know that A–B is the set of all those elements
which are in A but not in B. Therefore, the set A–B may denote the event ‘A but not
B’.We know that

       A – B = A ∩ B´

Example 1 Consider the experiment of rolling a die. Let A be the event ‘getting a
prime number’, B be the event ‘getting an odd number’. Write the sets representing
the events (i) Aor B (ii) A and B (iii)  A but not B (iv) ‘not A’.

Solution Here S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, A = {2, 3, 5} and B = {1, 3, 5}

Obviously

(i) ‘A or B’ = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 5}

(ii) ‘A and B’ = A ∩ B = {3,5}

(iii) ‘A but not B’ =  A – B = {2}

(iv) ‘not  A’ = A′ = {1,4,6}

14.1.4 Mutually exclusive events In the experiment of rolling a die, a sample space
is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Consider events, A ‘an odd number appears’ and B ‘an even
number appears’

Clearly the event A excludes the event B and vice versa. In other words, there is
no outcome which ensures the occurrence of events A and B simultaneously. Here

A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {2, 4, 6}

Clearly A ∩ B = φ,  i.e., A and B are disjoint sets.
In general, two events A and B are called mutually exclusive events if the

occurrence of any one of them excludes the occurrence of the other event, i.e., if they
can not occur simultaneously. In this case the sets A and B are disjoint.

Again in the experiment of rolling a die, consider the events A ‘an odd number
appears’ and event B ‘a number less than 4 appears’

Obviously A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {1, 2, 3}

Now 3 ∈ A  as well as 3 ∈ B

Therefore,  A and B are not mutually exclusive events.

Remark Simple events of a sample space are always mutually exclusive.

14.1.5 Exhaustive events Consider the experiment of throwing a die. We have
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let us define the following events

A: ‘a number less than 4 appears’,
B: ‘a number greater than 2 but less than 5 appears’

and C: ‘a number greater than 4 appears’.

Then A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3,4} and C = {5, 6}. We observe that

A ∪ B ∪ C = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {3, 4} ∪ {5, 6} = S.

Such events A, B and C are called exhaustive events. In general, if E , E , ..., E  are n

events of a sample space S and if

E1 ∪ E2 ∪ E3 ∪ ...∪ En = ∪ Ei = S

then E , E , ...., E  are called exhaustive events.In other words, events E , E , ..., E
1 2 n 1 2 n

are said to be exhaustive if atleast one of them necessarily occurs whenever the
experiment is performed.

Further, if E  ∩ E  = φ for i ≠ j  i.e., events E  and E are pairwise disjoint and
i j i j 

n

∪ E i = S , then events E , E , ..., E are called mutually exclusive and exhaustive
i=1 1 2 n 

events.
We now consider some examples.

Example 2 Two dice are thrown and the sum of the numbers which come up on the
dice is noted. Let us consider the following events associated with this experiment

A: ‘the sum is even’.

B: ‘the sum is a multiple of 3’.

C: ‘the sum is less than 4’.

D: ‘the sum is greater than 11’.

Which pairs of these events are mutually exclusive?

Solution There are 36 elements in the sample space S = {(x, y):  x, y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
Then

A = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 4),
       (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)}
B = {(1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 5), (5, 1), (3, 3), (2, 4), (4, 2), (3, 6), (6, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4),
       (6, 6)}
C = {(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2)} and D = {(6, 6)}

We find that
A ∩ B = {(1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 6)} ≠ φ

Therefore,  A and B are not mutually exclusive events.

Similarly A ∩ C ≠ φ, A ∩ D ≠ φ, B ∩ C ≠ φ and B ∩ D ≠ φ.

Thus, the pairs of events, (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), (B, D) are not mutually exclusive
events.

Also C ∩ D = φ and so C and D are mutually exclusive events.

Example 3 A coin is tossed three times, consider the following events.
A: ‘No head appears’, B: ‘Exactly one head appears’ and C: ‘Atleast two heads

appear’.

Do they form a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events?

Solution The sample space of the experiment is
S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}

and A = {TTT}, B = {HTT, THT, TTH}, C = {HHT, HTH, THH, HHH}
Now

A ∪ B ∪ C = {TTT, HTT, THT, TTH, HHT, HTH, THH, HHH} = S

Therefore,   A, B and C are exhaustive events.

Also, A ∩ B = φ, A ∩ C = φ and B ∩ C = φ
Therefore, the events are pair-wise disjoint, i.e., they are mutually exclusive.

Hence, A, B and C form a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events.

14.2  Axiomatic Approach to Probability
In earlier sections, we have considered random experiments, sample space and

events associated with these experiments. In our day to day life we use many words
about the chances of occurrence of events. Probability theory attempts to quantify
these chances of occurrence or non occurrence of events.

296 MATHEMATICS

In earlier classes, we have studied some methods of assigning probability to an
event associated with an experiment having known the number of total outcomes.

Axiomatic approach is another way of describing probability of an event. In this
approach some axioms or rules are depicted to assign probabilities.

Let S be the sample space of a random experiment. The probability P is a real
valued function whose domain is the power set of S and range is the interval [0,1]
satisfying the following axioms

(i) For any event E,  P (E) ≥ 0 (ii) P (S) = 1
(iii) If E and F are mutually exclusive events, then P(E ∪ F) = P(E) + P(F).

It follows from (iii) that P(φ) = 0. To prove this, we take F = φ and note that E and φ
are disjoint events. Therefore, from axiom (iii), we get

P (E ∪ φ) = P (E) + P (φ) or P(E) = P(E) + P (φ) i.e. P (φ) = 0.

Let S be a sample space containing outcomes ω1 , ω2 ,...,ωn , i.e.,

S = {ω , ω , ..., ω }
1 2 n

It follows from the axiomatic definition of probability that
(i) 0 ≤ P (ω ) ≤ 1 for each ω ∈ S

i i 

(ii) P (ω ) + P (ω ) + ... + P (ω ) = 1
1 2 n

(iii) For any event A, P(A) = ∑ P(ω ), ω ∈ A.
i i 

ANote   It may be noted that the singleton {ω } is called elementary event and
i

for notational convenience, we write P(ω ) for P({ω }).

of the outcomes H and T.

Clearly this assignment satisfies both the conditions i.e., each number is neither

less than zero nor greater than 1 and

P(H) + P(T) =  +  = 1

Therefore, in this case we can say that probability of H = , and probability of T =

Does this assignment satisfy the conditions of axiomatic approach?

1 3
Yes, in this case, probability of H =  and probability of T = .

4 4

We find that both the assignments (1) and (2) are valid for probability of
H and T.

In fact, we can assign the numbers p and (1 – p) to both the outcomes such that
0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and P(H) + P(T) = p + (1 –  p) = 1

This assignment, too, satisfies both conditions of the axiomatic approach of
probability. Hence, we can say that there are many ways (rather infinite) to assign
probabilities to outcomes of an experiment. We now consider some examples.

14.2.1  Probability of an event Let S be a sample space associated with the experiment
‘examining three consecutive pens produced by a machine and classified as Good
(non-defective) and bad (defective)’. We may get 0, 1, 2 or 3 defective pens as result
of this examination.
A sample space associated with this experiment is

S = {BBB, BBG, BGB, GBB, BGG, GBG, GGB, GGG},

where B stands for a defective or bad pen and G for a non – defective or good pen.

Let A = {HHT, HTH, THH} and B = {HTH, THH, HHH} be two events associated
with ‘tossing of a coin thrice’

Therefore P(A) + P(B) = + =

8 8 8
It is clear that P(A ∪ B) ≠ P(A) + P(B)

The points HTH and THH are common to both A and B. In the computation of
P(A) + P(B) the probabilities of points HTH and THH, i.e., the elements of A ∩B are
included twice. Thus to get the probability P(A ∪ B) we have to subtract the probabilities
of the sample points in A ∩ B from P(A) + P(B)

i.e. P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − ∑ P(ωi ),∀ωi ∈A ∩ B

= P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)

Thus we observe that, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)

In general, if A and B are any two events associated with a random experiment,
then by the definition of probability of an event, we have

P (A ∪ B) = ∑ p (ωi ) ,∀ωi ∈A ∪ B .

Since A∪B = (A–B) ∪ (A ∩ B) ∪ (B–A) ,

we have

P(A ∪ B) = [∑ P(ω )∀ωi ∈(A–B)] + [∑P(ωi )∀ωi ∈ A ∩ B]+ ∑ P(ωi ) i B – A
i [ ∀ω ∈ ]

(because A–B, A ∩ B and B – A are mutually exclusive)                     ... (1)

Also P(A) + P(B) = [∑ p(ωi ) ∀ωi ∈A ]+[∑ p(ωi ) ∀ωi ∈ B]
= [∑ P(ωi )∀ωi ∈(A–B) ∪ (A ∩ B)] + [∑ P(ωi )∀ωi ∈(B – A) ∪ (A ∩ B)]
= [∑ P(ωi )∀ωi ∈ (A – B)]+[∑ P(ωi )∀ωi ∈(A ∩ B)] + [∑ P(ωi )∀ωi ∈ (B–A)] +

   [∑ P(ωi )∀ωi ∈ (A ∩ B)]
= P(A ∪ B) + [∑P(ωi )∀ωi ∈A ∩ B]    [using (1)]

= P(A ∪ B)+ P(A ∩ B) .

Hence  P(A ∪ B) = P (A) +P(B) – P(A ∩ B) .

Alternatively, it can also be proved as follows:

A ∪ B = A ∪ (B – A), where A and B – A are mutually exclusive,

and   B = (A ∩ B) ∪ (B – A), where A ∩ B and B – A are mutually exclusive.

Using  Axiom (iii) of probability, we get

  PROBABILITY            301

P (A ∪B) = P (A) + P (B – A) ... (2)
and P(B) = P ( A ∩ B) + P (B – A) ... (3)

Subtracting (3) from (2) gives

P (A ∪ B) – P(B) = P(A) – P (A ∩ B)
or P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P (B) – P (A ∩ B)

The above result can further be verified by observing the Venn Diagram (Fig 14.1)

Fig 14.1

If A and B are disjoint sets, i.e., they are mutually exclusive events, then A ∩ B = φ

Therefore P(A ∩ B) = P (φ) = 0

Thus, for mutually exclusive events A and B, we have

P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) ,

which is Axiom (iii) of probability.

14.2.4  Probability of event ‘not A’  Consider the event A = {2, 4, 6, 8} associated

Also, we know that A′ and A are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events i.e.,

or P(A ∪ A′) = P(S)
Now P(A) + P(A′) = 1, by using axioms (ii) and (iii).

We now consider some examples and exercises having equally likely outcomes
unless stated otherwise.

Solution When a card is drawn from a well shuffled deck of 52 cards, the number of

Example 7 Two students Anil and Ashima appeared in an examination. The probability
that Anil will qualify the examination is 0.05 and that Ashima will qualify the examination

is 0.10. The probability that both will qualify the examination is 0.02. Find the
probability that

(a) Both Anil and Ashima will not qualify the examination.

(b)  Atleast one of them will not qualify the examination and

(c) Only one of them will qualify the examination.

Solution Let E and F denote the events that Anil and Ashima will qualify the examination,
respectively. Given that

P(E) = 0.05, P(F) = 0.10 and P(E ∩ F) = 0.02.

Then

(a) The event ‘both Anil and Ashima will not qualify the examination’ may be
expressed as  E´ ∩ F´.

Since, E´ is ‘not E’, i.e., Anil will not qualify the examination and F´ is ‘not F’, i.e.,
Ashima will not qualify the examination.

Also E´ ∩ F´ = (E ∪ F)´ (by Demorgan's Law)

Now P(E ∪ F) = P(E) + P(F) –  P(E ∩ F)

or P(E ∪ F) = 0.05 + 0.10 –  0.02 = 0.13

Therefore P(E´ ∩ F´) = P(E ∪ F)´ = 1 –  P(E ∪ F) = 1 –  0.13 = 0.87

(b) P (atleast one of them will not qualify)

= 1 –  P(both of them will qualify)

= 1 –  0.02 = 0.98

(c) The event only one of them will qualify the examination is same as the event

either (Anil will qualify, and Ashima will not qualify) or (Anil will not qualify and Ashima

will qualify) i.e., E ∩ F´ or E´ ∩ F, where E ∩ F´ and E´ ∩ F are mutually exclusive.

Therefore,  P(only one of them will qualify) = P(E ∩ F´ or E´ ∩ F)

= P(E ∩ F´) + P(E´ ∩ F) = P (E) – P(E ∩ F) + P(F) – P (E ∩ F)

= 0.05 – 0.02 + 0.10 – 0.02 = 0.11

Example 9 On  her vacations Veena visits four cities (A, B, C and D) in a random
order. What is the probability that she visits

(i) A before B? (ii) A before B and B before C?
(iii) A first and B last? (iv) A either first or second?
(v) A just before B?

Solution The number of arrangements (orders) in which Veena can visit four cities A,
B, C, or D is 4! i.e., 24.Therefore, n (S) = 24.
Since the number of elements in the sample space of the experiment is 24 all of these
outcomes are considered to be equally likely. A sample space for the
experiment is

S  = {ABCD, ABDC, ACBD, ACDB, ADBC, ADCB

Now

P(E) = P(B∪C)

Also A∩E = A∩ (B∪C)  = (A ∩B) ∪ (A ∩C) [using distribution property of

Summary

In this Chapter, we studied about the axiomatic approach of probability. The main
features of this Chapter are as follows:

®Event: A subset of the sample space

® Impossible event : The empty set

®Sure event: The whole sample space

®Complementary event or ‘not event’ : The set A′ or S – A

®Event A or B: The set A ∪ B

®Event A and B: The set A ∩ B

®Event A and not B: The set A – B

®Mutually exclusive event: A and B are mutually exclusive if A ∩ B = φ
®Exhaustive and mutually exclusive events: Events E , E ,..., E  are mutually

Probability of an event P(A) = , where n(A) = number of elements in

n(S)

the set A, n(S) = number of elements in the set S.

® If A and B are any two events, then

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B)
equivalently, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A ∩ B)

® If A and B are mutually exclusive, then P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

® If A is any event, then

Historical Note

Probability theory like many other branches of mathematics, evolved out of
practical consideration. It had its origin in the 16th century when an Italian
physician and mathematician Jerome Cardan (1501–1576) wrote the first book
on the subject “Book on Games of Chance” (Biber de Ludo Aleae). It was
published in 1663 after his death.

In 1654, a gambler Chevalier de Metre approached the well known French
Philosopher and Mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) for certain dice
problem. Pascal became interested in these problems and discussed with famous
French Mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665). Both Pascal and Fermat
solved the problem independently. Besides, Pascal and Fermat, outstanding
contributions to probability theory were also made by Christian Huygenes (1629–
1665), a Dutchman, J. Bernoulli (1654–1705), De Moivre (1667–1754), a
Frenchman Pierre Laplace (1749–1827), the Russian P.L Chebyshev (1821–
1897), A. A Markov (1856–1922) and A. N Kolmogorove (1903–1987).
Kolmogorov is credited with the axiomatic theory of probability. His book
‘Foundations of Probability’ published in 1933, introduces probability as a set
function and is considered a classic.
