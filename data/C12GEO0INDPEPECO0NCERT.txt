Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This
principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which
continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home
and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF
signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to
discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between
different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly
further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in
the National Policy on Education (1986).

The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning
and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise
that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by
engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the
prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key
reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating
creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as
participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of
functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in
implementing the annual  calendar so that the required number of teaching
days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and
evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making
children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress
or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of
curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different
stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving
higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering,
discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory
committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the higher secondary level,
Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor
M.H. Qureshi for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers
contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their
principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and
organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their
resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members
of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of
Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development
under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P.
Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation
committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of
its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable
us to undertake further revision and refinement.

Rationalisation of Content in the Textbooks

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content

load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also
emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities

for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background,

the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks

across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the

NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this

exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the

following:

• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas

in the same class

• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same

subject

• Difficulty level

• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much

interventions from teachers and can be learned by children

through self-learning or peer-learning

• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out

the changes given above.

Sources of Population Data

Population data are collected through

country. The first population Census in India
was conducted in 1872 but its first complete
Census was conducted only in 1881.

Distribution of  Population

Examine Fig. 1.1 and try to describe the
patterns of spatial distribution of population
shown on it. It is clear that India has a highly
uneven pattern of population distribution. The
percentage shares of population of the states
and Union Territories in the country (Appendix)
show that Uttar Pradesh has the highest
population followed by Maharashtra, Bihar and
West Bengal.

Chapter 2 For this purpose, people may erect houses and

other structures and command some area or
territory as their economic support-base. Thus,
the process of settlement inherently involves
grouping of people and apportioning of territory
as their resource base.

Settlements vary in size and type. They
range from a hamlet to metropolitan cities. With
size, the economic character and social structure
of settlements changes and so do its ecology and

settlements are called villages, specialising in

SETTLEMENTS agriculture or other primary activities. On the
other hand, there are fewer but larger settlements
which are termed as urban settlements
specialising in secondary and tertiary activities.
The basic differences between rural and urban
settlements are as follows :

• The rural settlements derive their life
support or basic economic needs from
land based primary economic activities,
whereas, urban settlements, depend on
processing of raw materials and
manufacturing of finished goods on the
one hand and a variety of services on the
other.

• Cities act as nodes of economic growth,
provide goods and services not only to
urban dwellers but also to the people of
the rural settlements in their hinterlands
in return for food and raw materials. This
functional relationship between the urban
and rural settlements takes place through
transport and communication network.

• Rural and urban settlements differ in
terms of social relationship, attitude and
outlook. Rural people are less mobile and
therefore, social relations among them are
intimate. In urban areas, on the other
hand, way of life is complex and fast, and
social relations are formal.

The latter is the area which the

the latter definition. Thus, there may

WATER RESOURCES constitutes only about 3 per cent of the total
water.  In fact, a very small proportion of
freshwater is effectively available for human use.
The availability of freshwater varies over space
and time. The tensions and disputes on sharing
and control of this scarce resource are becoming
contested issues among communities, regions,
and states. The assessment, efficient use and
conservation of water, therefore, become
necessary to ensure development. In this
chapter, we shall discuss water resources in
India, its geographical distribution, sectoral
utilisation, and methods of its conservation and
management.

##16##
Water Resources of India

India accounts for about 2.45 per cent of the
world’s surface area, 4 per cent of the world’s
water resources and more than 17 per cent of
the world’s population. The total water available
from precipitation in the country in a year is
about 4,000 cubic km. The availability from
surface water and replenishable groundwater
is 1,869 cubic km. Out of this, only 60 per cent
can be put to beneficial uses. Thus, the total
utilisable water resource in the country is only
1,122 cubic km.

Surface Water Resources

There are four major sources of surface water.
These are rivers, lakes, ponds and tanks. In
the country, there are about 10,360 rivers

Watershed Development in Ralegan Siddhi, Ahmadnagar, Maharashtra:
A Case Study

Ralegan Siddhi is a small village in the district of Ahmadnagar, Maharashtra. It has become an
example for watershed development throughout the country.
In 1975, this village was caught in a web of poverty and illicit liquor trade. The transformation took place
when a retired army personnel, settled down in the village and took up the task of watershed development.
He convinced villagers about the importance of family planning and voluntary labour; preventing open
grazing, felling trees, and liquor prohibition.
Voluntary labour was necessary to ensure minimum dependence on the government for financial
aids. “It socialised the costs of the projects.” explained the activist. Even those who were working
outside the village contributed to the development by committing a month’s salary every year.
Work began with the percolation tank constructed in the village. In 1975, the tank could not hold
water. The embankment wall leaked. People voluntarily repaired the embankment. The seven wells
below it swelled with water in summer for the first time in the living memory of the people. The people
reposed their faith in him and his visions.
A youth group called Tarun Mandal was formed. The group worked to ban the dowry system, caste
discrimination and untouchability. Liquor distilling units were removed and prohibition imposed. Open
grazing was completely banned with a new emphasis on stall-feeding. The cultivation of water-intensive
crops like sugarcane was banned. Crops such as pulses, oilseeds and certain cash crops with low
water requirements were encouraged.
All elections to local bodies began to be held
on the basis of consensus. “It made the
community leaders complete representatives
of the people.” A system of Nyay Panchayats
(informal courts) were also set up. Since then,
no case has been referred to the police.
A Rs.22 lakh school building was constructed
using only the resources of the village. No
donations were taken. Money, if needed, was
borrowed and paid back. The villagers took pride
in this self-reliance. A new system of sharing

Ralegan Siddhi before mitigation approach
labour grew out of this infusion of pride and
voluntary spirit. People volunteered to help each other in agricultural operation. Landless labourers also

gained employment. Today the village plans to
buy land for them in adjoining villages.
At present, water is adequate; agriculture is
flourishing, though the use of fertilisers and
pesticides is very high. The prosperity also brings
the question of ability of the present generation
to carry on the work after the leader of the
movement who declared that, “The process of
Ralegan’s evolution to an ideal village will not
stop. With changing times, people tend to evolve
new ways. In future, Ralegan might present a
different model to the country.”

Highlights of India’s National Water Policy 2012

The objective of the National Water Policy, 2012 is to assess the existing situation and to propose a
framework for a plan of action with a unified national perspective. In order to achieve the objective of
the Policy, a number of recommendations have been made therein for conservation, development and
improved management of water resources of the country.

Some of the salient features of national water policy 2012 are:

• Emphasis on the need for a national water framework law, comprehensive legislation for optimum
development of inter-State rivers and river valleys.

• Water, after meeting the pre-emptive needs for safe drinking water and sanitation, achieving food
security, supporting poor people dependent on agriculture for their livelihood and high priority
allocation for minimum eco-system needs, be treated as economic good so as to promote its
conservation and efficient use.

• Adaptation strategies in view of climate change for designing and management of water resources
structures and review of acceptability criteria has been emphasized.

• A system to evolve benchmarks for water uses for different purposes, i.e., water footprints, and
water auditing be developed to ensure efficient use of water.

• Removal of large disparity in stipulations for water supply in urban areas and in rural areas has
been recommended.

• Water resources projects and services should be managed with community participation.

Jal Kranti Abhiyan (2015-16)

Water is a recyclable resource but its availability is limited and the gap between supply and demand
will be widening over time. Climate change at the global scale will be creating water stress conditions
in many regions of the world. India has a unique situation of high population growth and rapid economic
development with high water demand. The Jal Kranti Abhiyan launched by the Government of India in
2015–16 with an aim to ensure water security through per capita availability of water in the country.
People in different regions of India had practised the traditional knowledge of water conservation and
management to ensure water availability.
The Jal Kranti Abhiyan aims at involving local bodies, NGOs and cititzens, at large, in creating
awareness regarding its objectives. The following activities have been proposed under the Jal Kranti
Abhiyan:
1. Selection of one water stressed village in each 672 districts of the country to create a ‘Jal Gram’.
2. Ídentification of model command area of about 1000 hectares in different parts of the country, for

example, UP, Haryana (North), Karnataka, Telangana, Tamil Nadu (South), Rajasthan, Gujarat
(West), Odisha (East), Meghalaya (North-East).

3. Abatement of pollution:
• Water conservation and artificial recharge.
• Reducing groundwater pollution.
• Construction of Arsenic-free wells in selected areas of the country.

4. Creating mass awareness through social media, radio, TV, print media, poster and  essay writing
competitions in schools.

Jal Kranti Abhiyan is designed to provide livelihood and food security through water security.

this sharp rise in overseas trade, such as the
momentum picked up by the manufacturing
sectors, the liberal policies of the government
and the diversification of markets.

The nature of India’s foreign trade has
changed over the years (Table 8.1). Though there
has been an increase in the total volume of import
and export, the value of import continued to be
higher than that of exports.

whereas the solid wastes of industrial units
are collected and disposed off through public

grounds (landfill areas). The huge turn out of
ashes and debris from industries, thermal
power houses and building constructions or
demolitions have posed problems of serious
consequences. Solid wastes cause health

Concentration of industrial units in and
around urban centres gives rise to disposal of
industrial wastes. The dumping of industrial
waste into rivers leads to water pollution. River
pollution from city-based industries and
untreated sewage leads to serious health
problems downstream.

Urban waste disposal is a serious problem
in India. In metropolitan cities like Mumbai, in the country, about 30 to 50 per cent of the

Case Study : A Role Model to Restore the Ecology and Safeguard
Human Health in Daurala

Based on the universal law “Polluter pays”, effort to restore the ecology and safeguard the human health with
people’s participation has taken place in Daurala near Meerut. These efforts are now bearing fruits after a
span of three years when Meerut based NGO had developed a model for ecological restoration. The meeting
of the Daurala Industries officials, NGOs, Government officials and other stakeholders at Meerut has brought
out results. The powerful logics, authentic studies and the pressure of people have brought a new lease of life
to the twelve thousand residents of this village. It was in the year 2003 that the pitiable condition of Dauralaites
drew the attention of the civil society. The groundwater of this village was contaminated with heavy metals.
The reason was that the untreated wastewater of Daurala industries was leaching to the groundwater table.
The NGO conducted a door to door survey of the health status of the residents and came out with a report.
The organisation, the village community and people’s representatives sat together to find out sustainable
solutions to the health problem. The industrialists showed a keen interest towards checking the deteriorating
ecology. The overhead water tank’s capacity in the village was enhanced and a 900m extra pipeline was  laid
to supply potable water to the community. The silted pond of the village was cleaned and recharged by
desilting it. Large quantity of silt was removed paving way to large quantity of water so that it recharged the
aquifers. Rainwater harvesting structures have been constructed at different places which has helped in
diluting the contaminants of the groundwater after the monsoons. 1000 trees have also been planted which
have improved the environment.

At present, 55 per cent of the world’s population lives in cities and more will join them in near future.
This proportion is estimated to go up to 68 per cent by 2050. That will put pressure on governments
to make urban areas better places to live with optimum infrastructure facilities for desirable quality of
life.

Urban population grows as a result of natural increase (when birth rate exceeds death rate), net in-
migration (when people move in than out), and sometimes reclassification of urban areas to encompass
formerly rural population settlements. In India, it is estimated that after 1961 around 60 per cent of the
urban growth has been attributed and about 29 per cent of them from rural areas to urban migration.

Dharavi–Asia’s Largest Slum

“…. Buses merely skirt the periphery. Autorickshaws cannot go there, Dharavi is part of central
Bombay where three wheelers are banned.

Only one main road traverses the slum, the miscalled ‘ninety-foot road’, which has been reduced to
less than half of that for most of its length. Some of the side alleys and lanes are so narrow that not

even a bicycle can pass. The whole neighbourhood consists of temporary buildings, two or three
storeyed high with rusty iron stairways to the upper part, where a single room is rented by a whole
family, sometimes accommodating twelve or more people; it is a kind of tropical version of the
industrial dwelling of Victorian London’s East End.

But Dharavi is a keeper of more sombre secrets than the revulsion it inspires in the rich; a revulsion,
moreover, that is, in direct proportion to the role it serves in the creation of the wealth of Bombay. In
this place of shadowless, treeless sunlight, uncollected garbage, stagnant pools of foul water, where
the only non-human creatures are the shining black crows and long grey rats, some of the most
beautiful, valuable and useful articles in India are made. From Dharavi come delicate ceramics and
pottery, exquisite embroidery and zari work, sophisticated leather goods, high-fashion garments,
finely-wrought metalwork, delicate jewellery settings, wood carvings and furniture that would find its
way into the richest houses, both in India and abroad…
Dharavi was an arm of the sea, that was filled by waste, largely produced by the people who have
come to live there: Scheduled Castes  and poor Muslims. It comprises rambling buildings of corrugated
metal, 20 metres high in places, used for the treatment of hides and tanning. There are pleasant
