Foreword

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 recommends that children’s 

life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle 

marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to 

shape our system and creates a gap between the school, home and community. 

The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt 

to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning 

and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. 

We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction 
of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on 

Education  (1986).

This initiative can succeed only if all stakeholders – school principals, 

parents and teachers – encourage children to reflect on their own learning and 
to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given 

space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with 

the information passed on to them by adults. We also must remember that a 

prescribed textbook is only one of the learning resources for a child, and the 

teacher another. Her/his home and her/his environment, her/his life and her/

his peers, all these are resources and sites of learning. Inculcating creativity 

and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as the chief agents 

of their learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These beliefs 
imply a considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. 

The book in your hands at present is an example of how a textbook 

can be. It is based on NCERT’s resolve to reconstruct knowledge in all 

areas from the perspective of the learner and the dynamic socio-economic 

realities of contemporary India. The National Focus Group on Gender Issues 

in Education, appointed under the auspices of NCF-2005, emphasises the 

urgency of incorporating women’s perspective for epistemologically redefining 
conventionally defined subjects like home science. We hope that the present 
textbook will make this subject free of gender bias and capable of challenging 

young minds and teachers for creative study and practical work.

NCERT appreciates the hard work done by the Textbook Development 

Committee responsible for this book. We are especially grateful to the members 

of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of 

Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development, 

for their valuable time and contribution and the sub-committee (National 

Review Committee) for Human Ecology and Family Sciences (HEFS) for their 

contribution in reviewing the textbook.

Rationalisation of Content in the 

Textbooks

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce 

content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also 

emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities 

for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, 

the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks 

across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the 

NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this 

exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the 

following:

• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas 

in the same class

• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same 

subject

• Difficulty level
• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much 

interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through 

self-learning or peer-learning

• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

is present edition, is a reformatted version aer carrying out the 
changes given above.

Preface

The textbooks on Human Ecology and Family Sciences (HEFS), hitherto known 
as ‘Home Science’, have been developed based on the vision and principles of 
the National Curriculum Framework – 2005 of the NCERT. Globally, the field of 
Home Science is known by newer nomenclatures but encompasses basically 
five domains, namely, Food and Nutrition, Human Development and Family 
Studies, Fabric and Apparel, Resource Management, and Communication and 
Extension. Each of these domains or specialisations (as referred to in various 
colleges and Universities) have grown and matured with expanding horizons, 
keeping in tune with the changing needs of individuals, families, industry and 
society. Consequently these domains have developed newer thrusts in view 
of the evolving job market, and in many Universities have been renamed to 
represent their current status and scope in a better way.

All these domains have their specific content and focus that contribute 
to the Quality of Life (QoL) of individuals, families and communities in the 
global, socio-cultural and socio-economic contexts. Every person is entitled 
to a good QoL, and this creates a demand for professionals who can positively 
contribute to different arenas and needs of personal and social life – ranging 
from basic sanitation, housing, health care for physical and mental well-
being, safety, environmental promotion and protection, clothing, finance and 
a host of myriad allied aspects of living, from micro to macro levels. This 
obviously creates a challenge for educationists and educational institutions 
to train persons to deliver the multifarious services. In this context, HEFS 
provides numerous avenues with interdisciplinary perspectives. These include 
opportunities to work in industry/corporate sector, teaching at various levels, 
research and development, various cadres in public sector, regional, national 
and international organisations that work with and for communities as well 
as entrepreneurial ventures.

The academic fraternity, professionals working for community development 
and those from industry are constantly interacting and shaping the education 
and training in these fields. Thus  educational programmes offered under 
HEFS (Home Science/ Family and Community Sciences) are geared up towards 
development of professionals who not only have knowledge and skills, but are 
also sensitised to the challenges, needs and concerns related to quality of life, 
productivity and sustainable development. 

This textbook takes a holistic approach to address the pertinent issues 
related to work, employment and careers, keeping quality of life in perspective, 
individually and collectively. Hence the first unit and chapter is focussed on life 
skills for livelihood, attitudes to work, work challenges, creativity, performance 
and productivity,  social responsibility and volunteerism. The importance of 
flexibility, diversity, adaptation, balance between work, rest and recreation, 
enhanced job satisfaction, and importance of occupational health and safety 
are dwelt upon. Entrepreneurship versus employment is discussed, especially

bringing to the fore the opportunities that entrepreneurship provides for those 
are interested in initiating innovation and change. While change is desirable, it 
is important not to forget our rich traditional heritage of knowledge and skills. 
Many of the traditional occupations, when coupled with innovation, modern 
perspectives and good marketing, have tremendous economic potential.  

The other chapters and units describe the five salient domains of HEFS. 
Within each domain, there are several fields that offer ample professional 
opportunities and occupational avenues.  The syllabus and textbook attempt 
to bring to focus the scope and significance of each domain in the present 
day scenario, with inputs on knowledge and skills to be acquired and honed, 
including use of ICT for not only gathering information but also as part of 
practicals, activities and projects in order to be a ‘valued’ professional. 

The practicals have been designed to enable learners to gain insights 
and also have a bird’s eye view of the tasks and challenges inherent in the 
various professional careers and avenues. Considerable emphasis is laid on 
‘construction of knowledge’ through field exposure and first-hand experiences. 
The exercises and projects would help to encourage critical thinking, develop 
analytical and writing skills and eventually inculcate the ‘passion to learn’. 
Many insights and ‘seeds’ of information have been ‘sown’. Students and 
teachers in partnership can explore, think about,  discover and discuss a 
variety of topics and issues. Further learning is encouraged through select 
exercises and review questions at the end of each unit. Some of the issues 
of current concern that have been addressed, could not only be thought 
provoking, but also foster sensitivity and social responsibility in the use of 
this textbook. Exercises in understanding region-specific opportunities and 
available resources have been included to encourage students (with guidance 
from their teachers) to understand, appraise and appreciate their own socio-
cultural ethos and locales. 

Objectives

The Human Ecology and Family Sciences (HEFS) textbook for Class XII has 
been framed to enable the learners to:

1. understand the scope and significance of each domain within HEFS.
2. appreciate the importance of life skills for work, livelihood and careers.

3. become sensitive to the nuances of work vis-à-vis age and gender.

4. appreciate the potential of entrepreneurship and other varied professional 
opportunities.

5. make informed career choices. 

A feedback questionnaire is given at the end. We will appreciate your comments 
and views about various aspects of this textbook. You may use the given 
questionnaire or write to us on a plain paper/send e-mail. Your feedback will 
help us to improve further reprint editions.

A Note to the Teachers

Dear Teachers,

You must have noted the radical changes in the organisation of these textbooks, 
compared to the conventional way in which Home Science education was 
earlier designed and delivered. However, the contents and the focus of the 
domains within Home Science (now called HEFS in the context of the revised 
NCERT syllabus), essentially remain undiluted. In fact, in the syllabus and 
textbook organisation, care has been taken to cover the basics and go further, 
to expose students to the newer and emerging horizons of the five domains 
– Food and Nutrition, Human Development and Family Studies, Fabric and 
Apparel, Resource Management, and Communication and Extension. This 
deliberate departure from the earlier convention is to dispel the misconception 
about the discipline being limited in focus and scope to domestic science, and 
art and craft. The effort is also to create an interest in the field for its varied, 
multidisciplinary strengths, both in terms of quality education and potential 
for professional avenues.  

In each chapter from Unit 2 onwards, the textbook has been designed 
to inform the learners about the significance and scope of each domain, the 
multiple thrusts that exist and are emerging. Each unit spells out the basic 
concepts, requisite knowledge and skills in each thrust area and delineates 
the career avenues and the preparation required for them in order to make 
informed career choices. 

Unit 1 is about work, life skills, careers and livelihoods. It starts with a 
description about meaningful work and moves on to point out the need to 
balance work with rest and recreation, to ensure a good standard of living 
and quality of life. Further, the chapter elaborates on success and happiness 
in work life resulting from wholesome attitudes and approaches to work.  An 
attempt has been made therein to introduce and sensitise youth to ethics, 
social responsibility, volunteerism and dignity of labour. In this context, it is 
pertinent to discuss the rich heritage of traditional occupations of India, with 
a view to informing the students that with creativity and innovation, there 
are immense opportunities for a satisfying career. The immense potential of 
entrepreneurship as a challenging career avenue is brought to focus to further 
the interests of the youth, especially for those who would like to be their own 
masters, to create employment for others while being gainfully self-employed. 
The unit also delves into the importance of a healthy work environment and the 
need to sustain good occupational health, while being aware of occupational 
hazards and safety measures required. It is felt that youth of today need to 
understand current issues including work in the context of age (child labour 
and engaging senior citizens) and gender ( women and work). In this context, 
it is felt that the school(s) could invite  ‘guest faculty or experts’ to interact 
with the students to enable them to obtain first hand realistic information.

Teachers should note that considerable theoretical inputs are required 
for students and learners to gain deeper understanding and appreciation 
of the different areas in each domain. Therefore, some basic theoretical 
information has been included in each unit. This theory-based content should 
provide adequate material for testing students’ achievement in acquisition of 
knowledge. Further, based on student interest and capability, and region–
specific resources and facilities, teachers may motivate and help students to 
obtain more information in areas and issues of their interest. The inclusion 
of review questions, activities, exercises, practicals, field visits and reporting, 
are envisaged as opportunities for students to develop reading and writing 
skills as well as critical and analytical thinking. Gathering and processing 
information is important per se. However, students should be encouraged to 
think and discuss the various issues and topics delineated in this textbook 
as a means of helping youth to think, construct knowledge and articulate. All 
these experiences have been deliberately introduced so that learning may be 
meaningful and enjoyable. 

It may be noted that in the units, the authors have included several 
activities and exercises, which are suitable and would enhance learning as 
well as relieve the tedium of classroom instruction. It is expected that teachers 
and students would decide upon the number of activities and exercises they 
can honestly complete within the academic year. Teachers may encourage 
students to do as many as possible in and outside the classroom to ‘fan the 
flame’ of curiosity and joyful learning. Use of ICT has been recommended in 
these textbooks for seeking information, for making power point presentations, 
designing educational and promotional materials. In all units, wherever 
possible, teachers are advised to ensure that the students have exposure and 
practice with ICT for various purposes. 

In addition, a number of inter-disciplinary projects have been included. 
Every student should have an opportunity to participate in any one project, 
and it is expected that students would have an opportunity to participate in 
the chosen project either in groups or in pairs. Since the learners may be 
relatively unfamiliar with conducting projects, it is essential that the project 
be guided by the teacher throughout, from the planning stage to execution 
and report writing.

The syllabii for all chapters delineated in further detail are given herein. 
In the process of developing the textbook, the teams have expressed the need 
for highlighting and including and deleting some selected issues. Thus, some 
modifications have emerged that are indicated in a tabular form.

Work, Livelihood 
and Career

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, the learner will be able to:

zz explain meaningful work, livelihood, careers and entrepreneurship.

zz understand the concepts of standard of living and quality of life.

zz know the importance of social responsibility and volunteerism.

zz explain the attitudes and approaches that contribute to quality of 
work life and successful careers.

and special groups namely women, children and elderly. 

zz describe the characteristics of a healthy work environment

Introduction

Deciding a career for oneself is not an easy task. On one hand, there 
are several career avenues to choose from, and on the other, for a young 
person, aptitude and talent are yet to be identified and recognised. Also in 
some cases, interests are very diverse. Thus, it is not easy to make a choice. 
In order to make the right choice, it is essential that youth be exposed to 
different possible options. First, it is important to explore oneself in order 

2

Reprint 2025-26



to identify one’s own aptitudes, talent, personal preferences, needs and 
aspirations. Then the exploration of options must start, in which one tries 
to combine one’s strength for personal benefit as well as social contribution. 
An appropriate choice will bring the person success and satisfaction.

Work and Meaningful Work

Work is primarily an activity that all human beings have to perform and 
through which each one ‘fits’ into the world, creates new relations, uses 
an individual’s unique talents and skills and above all,  learns and grows 
to develop one’s identity and a sense of belongingness to society. Work 
can be described as essential activities undertaken for a purpose or out of 
necessity. 

Work is central in all cultures, although every culture has its own values 
and perceptions about it. In fact, work essentially constitutes the bulk of 
daily life activities for all human beings. The type of work undertaken by 
people depends on several factors such as education, health, age, access to 
opportunities, globalisation, geographic location, financial returns, family 
background and so on. 

Most human beings work to acquire money, provide for their families, 
and to earn leisure, recreation, play and free time. Work can serve as a 
catalyst for developing one’s personal identity and boosting self-esteem. 
Work contributes in many forms. When we work, we contribute to 
ourselves — our sense of confidence or well-being and for financial gain. We 
also contribute to the organisation that employs us by helping to create 
better products or a better reputation for the organisation, or greater 
profits. Our work has an impact on the quality of life in the world around 
us. 

It can be rightly said that ‘work is the oil that lubricates the machine of 
society’. Not only human beings, but all creatures and elements of nature 
are constantly ‘working’, contributing to life itself. In fact, it is the collective 
work of humans and nature that gives us our basic necessities, comforts 
and luxuries. While in most cases, work primarily enables the worker to 
earn a livelihood, there are persons who work ceaselessly for pleasure, 
intellectual stimulation, contribution to society per se, despite the fact 
that they do not earn any amount of money, for example, the work done 
by family members for the family, volunteers, etc. Thus, work is not always 
about how much money a person earns; rather it is about whether one 
makes a contribution to oneself, one’s family, one’s employers, to society, 
to nation or to the world.

Unit I - Work, Livelihood and Career



Work may be viewed as:

zz A ‘job’ and a means of making a ‘living’.

zz A task, or duty that entails a sense of obligation.

zz A means of security of livelihood through securing job and income.

zz ‘Dharma’ or duty, an expression of one’s true Self, an expression 
of one’s unique talents that influences the quality of life of self and 
others around us.

zz A part of spiritual practice.

zz A vehicle for one’s creations. 

zz A source of joy and fulfillment.
zz Working and earning one’s livelihood offers scope for hope, self-esteem 

and dignity. 

zz A symbol of status, power and control.

zz A rewarding experience, a sort of mental or physical workout that can 
result in success.

zz A means of self development and self-actualisation (reflecting values 
and aspirations). 

When an individual is involved in meaningful work, s/he develops a 
sense of identity, worth, and dignity. 

What is meaningful work? : Meaningful work is useful to society or to 
others, is done responsibly and is enjoyable to the worker. It enables 
the worker to use his/her skills and judgment, to showcase his/her 
creativity, or problem-solving ability. Ideally, work should be performed in 
an environment that stimulates the development of positive professional 
relationships and also brings recognition and/or rewards.

When the outcome or result of the work performed is meaningful or 
successful, it contributes to personal growth, instills confidence and self 
worth and may eventually even lead to actualisation of full potential. Work 
provides opportunities to contribute to the improvement of one’s own life 
conditions and that of society in the wider context.

For any person, being involved in work (as an employee or self employed) 
that best suits one’s personal attributes, talents or aptitude, competence 
and skills is very important. This paves the way for a life long career. So it 
is important to choose something to sustain the individual’s enthusiasm 
to carry on his/her work. Therefore, the work life for anyone and everyone 
should ideally be an expression of one’s potentials and aspirations. Persons 
entering work life and also those thinking of building a career can ask 
themselves the following questions:

zz What are my special talents, traits and interests vis–a–vis an 
4

occupation?

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



zz Is the work stimulating and challenging?

zz Is the occupation likely to give me a sense of being useful?

zz Does the job make me feel that I am contributing to society?

zz Are the ethos and environment of the workplace likely to be suitable to me?

For most persons, it is definitely imperative and obligatory to earn a 
livelihood in order to fulfill the basic needs of self and family. Most work 
can be for earning money – such work is conventionally referred to as a 
‘job’. However, many individuals choose to go beyond a job, to make a 
career, working steadily on a chosen career path. Thus a ‘career’ is more 
than just a job. One may distinguish between a job and a career by saying 
‘job is an involvement in work for the sake of it’ whereas ‘a career is driven 
by a deep desire to excel and a passionate need to grow, develop and prove 
oneself within the chosen field of work’.

There have been changes in concepts about careers over the years. 
It is no longer sufficient to get a job. It is very important to continually 
upgrade and learn newer skills, update knowledge and build or enhance 
competencies, in order to achieve success. Thus, in the modern world, 
education should not stop in youth or early adulthood but needs to 
continue into one’s middle career years and if necessary, into one’s later 
career years. 

How does one decide what career to pursue? Many children may choose 
to follow in their parents’ footsteps. Others may select careers that differ 
from their parents or what their parents might have planned for them. 
One of the most important criteria for selecting an avenue is that one must 
feel a sense of keen interest and desire for the chosen path. One of the 
crucial aspects in making decisions about the choice of career is that one 
must find enjoyment in the job, particularly when one assumes financial 
responsibility for the family.

Work, Careers and Livelihoods

Work is a set of activities with an intended set of outcomes. Yet it is not 
necessarily tied to paid employment, but may include entrepreneurship, 
consulting, volunteerism, contract, social work for community welfare 
and other professional activities. Livelihood denotes the means and 
occupation by which a person supports oneself to meet basic needs, and 
sustain one’s lifestyle. It involves choice of occupation and career path 
and the design of a work lifestyle. On the other hand, careers are unique 
to each person and are dynamic, unfolding throughout life. Career is a life 
management concept. Growing in one’s career is a lifelong process that 
involves managing roles, maintaining a balance between paid and unpaid 
work, learning, personal life roles, and making transitions whenever or

Webster dictionary defines career as “a field for or pursuit of consecutive

and work as “the labor, task, or duty that is one’s accustomed means of 
livelihood/profession or occupation chosen as one’s life’s work”. Whatever 
one chooses, in a holistic sense it should nourish body as well as mind and

Traditional Occupations of India

India is one of the richest 
countries as far as art and culture 
are concerned. Few countries in 
the world have such an ancient 
and diverse culture as does this 
country. Despite diversity, there 
has been cultural and social 
cohesiveness of an enduring 
nature. Over the years, the 
stability of this culture has been 
maintained more through the social and cultural practices, though there 
have been some disruptions through foreign invasions and upheavals. 

Agriculture has been one of the major occupations for a large proportion 
of the population because the climatic conditions in most parts of India 
are suitable for agricultural activities. Since almost 70 per cent of the 
population lives in rural areas, farming is the largest source of employment 
for millions of people. A considerable proportion of them are involved in 
farming small plots of land, many of which may not even be owned by 
them leading to only marginal production of crops. Such poor yield may 
not be even sufficient for family consumption, leave alone permitting sale 
of produce for profit. In most parts of the country, some farmers produce 
cash crops for sale in urban markets, and in some areas, crops such as tea, 
coffee, cardamom and rubber are of great economic importance because 
they bring in foreign exchange. India is the largest producer of cashew nut, 
coconut, milk, ginger, turmeric and black pepper in the world. It is the one 
of the largest producers of fruits and vegetables, spices and condiments 
and tea. Yet another important traditional occupation has been fishing 
because of the country’s very long coastline. 

Handicrafts have been one of the traditional occupations in Indian 
villages, and today many Indian arts and crafts are very popular in the 
international market and have become a means of livelihood for the rural 
folk. Some examples of crafts are wood craft, pottery, metal craft, jewellery 
making, ivory craft, comb craft, glass and paper craft, embroidery, weaving, 
dyeing and printing, shell craft, sculpture, terracotta, sholapitha craft, 
dhurries, rugs and carpets, clay and iron items, etc. Weaving is a cottage 
industry in India. Each state has typical woven fabrics, embroideries and 
traditional costumes which are suitable for the region-specific climate 
and life style. Different regions in India are famous for different types 
of weaving. Indian hand-woven fabrics have won acclaim for centuries.

In the past many of these were made for daily use and others for decorative 
purposes. These occupations and many others are reflective of the base of 
the socio-economic culture. However, the modern economy has catapulted 
such craft items into the global market, earning the country considerable 
foreign exchange.

Traditionally, the processes, techniques and skills of the crafting and 
manufacturing were handed from one generation to the next, to members 
within the family. The transfer of this indigenous knowledge and training 
thereof, was primarily home-based training, and the know-how and finer 
nuances were tightly guarded secrets within closed groups in a given 
occupation. In India, the dynamics of religion, caste and occupation 
have been tightly interwoven, coupled with hierarchical order of clusters 
within the social fabric of the country. There are hundreds of different 
traditional occupations, for example, hunting and trapping birds and 
animals, gathering and selling foreign produce, garland making, salt 
making, tapping of neera or palm sap juice, mining, brick and tile making. 
Other inter-generational traditional occupations include priests, sweepers, 
scavengers, leather workers, etc.

Like weaving, embroidery and the visual arts, each region of India 
has a typical cuisine, comprising a vast variety of local foods cooked with 
indigenous ingredients and spices. India is well known for its tasty, tongue-
tickling cuisine which has emerged as a source of livelihood for innumerable 
persons, ranging from street food vendors to speciality restaurants and 
theme pavilions in 5-star hotels. Many popular traditional foods and spice 
mixes and masalas are in demand in other countries.

Embroidery and Textiles of India

                                          

India has a multiplicity of visual arts that have been in practice for over 
four thousand years. Historically, the artists and artisans were supported 
by two main categories of patrons: the larger Hindu temples and the 
princely rulers of various states. The main visual arts arose in the context 
of religious worship. Distinctive regional styles of architecture are seen in 
different parts of India, reflecting various religions  namely Islam, Sikhism, 
Jainism, Christianity and Hinduism, which typically co-existed across the 
country. Therefore in different places of worship and mausoleums (burial 
chambers), palaces, etc. a great variety of images skilfully carved in stone, 
or cast in bronze or silver, or modeled in terra-cotta or wood or colourfully 
painted were commonly prevalent, most of which have been preserved in 
India’s vast heritage. In the modern scenario, these arts are preserved and 
promoted through the efforts of government and several non-governmental 
organisations, providing occupational avenues including entrepreneurship.

Despite the rich heritage of traditional occupations, in the modern 
context, these works of art are gradually losing out to mass–produced 
goods, leaving the artisans with meager sources of income on the one

hand and a gradual erosion of the aesthetic appreciation of fine arts on 
the other. Illiteracy, general socio-economic backwardness, slow progress 
in implementing land reforms and inadequate or inefficient finance and 
marketing services are major constraints that cause this trend. Shrinkage of 
forests, depletion of resource base and general environmental degradation 
are responsible for various problems faced in this context.

         

 Coconut craft of Kerala Bamboo craft of Assam

These are tremendous challenges and indicate an urgent need for the 
revival and sustaining of the indigenous knowledge, know-how and skills 
which are fast losing ground. Some of the areas where interventions are 
required are design innovations, preservation and refinement strategies, 
use of eco-friendly raw materials, packaging, establishment of training 
facilities, conservation of traditional knowledge and protection of 
intellectual property rights (IPR). It is important for the modern youth and 
communities to be aware of the tremendous scope and potential for career 
avenues for individuals. In addition, such efforts and initiatives will go a 
long way to enhance the income generation potential of the rural folk. It is 
worthy to note that the Government of India is making concerted efforts in 
this direction. The need of the hour and the challenge confronting Indian 
society is to maintain the diversity without the hierarchy or caste-based 
work divisions in the democratic milieu.

Work, Age and Gender 

The age and sex of members of any workforce influence the dynamics of 
personal and professional lives, both from the perspective of the individual 
(micro perspective) and also that of society and nation(macro perspective). 
The health and development of children and women is at stake when 
they are forced into labour that is not suitable to their physiological and 
psychological state. These segments of the population as well as the elder 
population need attention from several perspectives. Let us briefly discuss 
the challenges facing these three groups. 

Gender Issues in Relation to Work

Nature distinguishes the two sexes clearly in most forms of life, with 
biological and functional differences being well established. Human 
beings generally differentiate between the two sexes, i.e. men and women. 
However, lately India’s Supreme Court has recognised transgender people 
as a third gender who are also refered to as transsexual, cross dressers etc. 
The differences between men and women range from biological to socio-
cultural.  The terms ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ indicate the differentiations from the 
biological to the social and cultural perspectives. The term sex and gender 
are often used interchangeably, but strictly speaking they have different 
biological meanings. Sex refers to the bilogical categorisation based on 
genetics, reproductive organs or similar things, whereas, gender is based 
on social identity. Male denotes boys and men whereas female denotes 
girls and women. The external manifestation of sex is through the primary 
sexual organs or the genitals. This difference is due to XX and XY or some 
other chromosome combinations. In every society, the social and cultural 
practices determine how various genders are expected to behave and the 
type of work they do, thus constructing the identity of individual’s right 
from an early age which slowly continues to impact all throughout their 
growth and development. The members of any society or community are 
expected to perform their roles in particular ways as demanded by social 
and cultural traditions thereby creating and establishing norms of gender 
role identity. Over a period of time, these norms and practices become 
stereotyped and then it is considered the normal and expected behaviour 
from each one of its members. Although these norms and practices are 11

Reprint 2025-26

Unit I - Work, Livelihood and Career



not written down and there is no rule book for these, they are generally 
passed on from one generation to another and continue to be practised. 
Therefore, it is said that Gender is socially constructed.

Any deviation from that normal and expected becomes unconventional, 
non-traditional and sometimes even defiant. However, with time roles 
and behaviours are evolving, resulting in ‘continuity with change’. It can 
be seen that the age old assigned roles as bread winner for men and as 
home maker for women are in transition.  However, in India, women 
have all along been engaged in production and in some societies even in 
marketing. In rural India, women are intensively and extensively involved 
in agriculture and animal husbandry. In urban areas, women are involved 
in construction activities or are employed as domestic labour.  All these are 
working women and have been contributing to the income of the family in 
one way or the other. In many families, women are the sole bread-earners. 

Despite their active participation in earning and contributing to the 
family resources, freedom to make decisions and vogue to independence 
are denied to women. Women therefore continue to remain powerless. The 
need of the hour is to educate and empower women and give them their 
rightful voice and place in society.  

Women cannot be empowered until the work they do at home is 
valued and is considered equivalent to paid work. The work performed 
by women as homemakers has rarely been valued or even counted as 
an economic activity. However, there is a saying ‘money saved is money 
earned’.  The household chores and the domestic work that women do to 
support the family, in all stages of their life as mother, sister, daughter, 
wife and grandmother, demands energy throughout their lifetime. Such 
contributions help other members of the family to perform their roles and 
duties more efficiently. Therefore, domestic work done by women needs to 
be valued as an economic contribution and productive activity.

Women’s participation in the workforce outside the home has helped 
emancipate the woman as well as improve the family’s resources. Women 
have started participating in each sector of the economy, many of them 
occupying senior positions. However, this has placed a double burden 
on women, since they are still expected to perform most or all of their 
household chores and be the primary caregivers. 

Issues and Concerns Related to Women and Work 

Opportunities of participation by women in the labour market have declined 
and they have been marginalised due to the need for skilled workers. 
Therefore, to safeguard the interests of women, training facilities to develop 

12 skills need to be increased. Primary earning members are considered to be 

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



men and women’s earnings are considered supplementary and secondary, 
and even if they are sole bread earners, they do not have a similar standing 
in the market. Some of the other issues concerning women in modern India 
are stress and adverse effects on health, security and safety at work places 
without gender discrimination, maternity benefits and social support for 
child care. 

Constitutional Rights, Acts and The State Initiatives: It is important to 
note that the Constitution of India guarantees equality to both men and 
women in all walks of life, including guaranteeing equal opportunity for 
all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office 
under the State and forbids discrimination in respect of any employment or 
office on grounds of caste, creed, colour, race or sex. It also stipulates that 
women workers be provided just and humane conditions of work and be 
protected from any kind of exploitation, and be supported and encouraged 
in their educational and economic pursuits. The Indian Constitution also 
empowers the State to make special provisions for women and children. 
Also, there are Acts which safeguard Constitutional rights of women such 
as the Factories Act of 1948, the Plantation Labour Act of 1951, the Mines 
Act of 1952, etc. which provide protection to women in various industrial 
sectors, Employees State Insurance Act (ESI Act) and the Maternity Benefit 
Act, 1961. 

Article 16 (1) of the Constitution of India guarantees equality of 
opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment and 
appointment to any office under the state.

Besides this, Section 48 of the Factories Act states that  creches should 
be maintained if more than 30 women are employed in an industry or 
factory. Children below six years should be looked after in these crèches 
which will be maintained by the industry itself. Many state initiatives were 
taken to improve the condition of women in employment and in need of 
employment. Women’s cells were created in the Ministry of Labour to look 
at the problems of women workers. The Equal Remuneration Act for equal 
wages for the same work or work of a similar nature also came into force. A 
National Plan of Action (NPA) for women was taken up by the Department 
of Social Welfare to implement the Equal Remuneration Act. A working 
group on women’s employment was also constituted by the Planning 
Commission for enhancing the employment opportunities for women 
belonging to rural areas and to review the labour laws on women’s work 
and their participation in economic and productive activities. A steering 

13

Reprint 2025-26

Unit I - Work, Livelihood and Career



committee to build the data base on women’s work, particularly in the 
rural areas, was also formed by the Planning Commission. 

Over the years there has been a paradigm shift in the ways women’s 
programmes have been initiated. During the earlier decades the programmes 
for women were based on the welfare approach, slowly it moved to equality 
of opportunity and then finally to development approach. It was realised 
that until women’s development programmes are in full swing benefits 
cannot be reaped as women are part of human resource. Although in 
some sectors women have been achievers, economically and financially 
they have to march long roads to achieve equal partnership with men. The 
mindset has to be modern. The attitude and approach have to change to 
ensure dramatic transformation in the way gender issues related to work 
are approached in the society.

Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV): KGBV was initiated as 
a scheme of Government of India under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA). 
Currently, it is subsumed under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyaan, an overarching 
scheme and the umbrella programme of Government of India for the school 
education. KGBV started as a scheme for bringing never-enrolled and 
dropout girls from rural, remote and disadvantaged sections of the society 
into school education till elementary level in residential schools. The scheme 
now has been extended till Class XII to ensure inclusive and equitable 
quality education at all levels of school education. All the girls enrolled 
in KGBVs study the Bridge Course for preparing them for the entry level. 
The entry level in KGBVs for these girls is Class VI. The KGBVs have been 
opened in backward blocks of each district. This scheme also helps in the 
implementation of ‘Right to Education Act’ (RTE) of the Government of India.

Attitudes and Approaches to Work, 
Life Skills and Quality of Work Life

Attitudes and Approaches to Work

The attitude towards work is not only about the work / job itself. It is also 
about how any individual perceives ones’ own work situation, handles the 
circumstances and demands of the job and the various tasks entailed. An 
individual’s experience of job satisfaction or dissatisfaction is considerably 
influenced by their attitude, rather than being determined entirely by the job 
per se. Further, an individual’s perception can be affected by comparisons 
they may make. For instance, if a person compares only the salary 
s/he receives with that of another, without taking into account the work 
responsibilities, the qualifications required, the work output, sincerity 
and dedication of the other person, there is scope for dissatisfaction. On 
the other hand, under realistic scrutiny of all aspects (both positive and 
negative) of one’s own job, the possibility of satisfaction and happiness is 
greater. Most people spend a considerable proportion of time everyday at 
work. Therefore, the importance of work routines being established along 
with good health practices such as eating healthy, balanced diets, sleeping 
well and using leisure time proactively should be emphasised. But often, 
some people perceive work as something they have to ‘do somehow or 
anyhow’ and therefore are unable to enjoy or even think of enjoying the 
work. However, when a person perceives his/her ‘work’ as a source of 
energy, fulfillment and learning, job satisfaction is ensured.

On the other hand, some persons enjoy their jobs, look forward to 
challenges, handle difficult tasks with a positive outlook and this makes 
them feel good about their jobs. Similarly, opportunities for progress in 
their career and to use their abilities, skills and knowledge contribute to 
personal happiness and the ‘quality of working life’ of the organisation. 

Quality of Work Life 

Quality of Work Life (QWL) of employees is considered important by 
organisations. In this approach, the employees are considered to be ‘assets’ 
and it is believed that people perform better when they are satisfied with 
their work conditions. It is generally accepted that satisfying employees’ 
social and psychological needs is as important as satisfying their economic 
needs to help motivate them. It incorporates several perspectives which 
are not only work-based factors such as job and career satisfaction, 
satisfaction with pay and relationships with work colleagues, absence of 

16

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



stress at work, and opportunities for participative decision making, balance 
between work / career and home and general feelings of well-being. 

All human beings like to survive and thrive in an environment that 
encourages and motivates them to do all the good work that they are 
capable of. Therefore, it is crucial to have a culture of creating happy and 
healthy work environments, not only in the physical and social sense but 
also in the deeper psychological / mental and emotional aspects. A healthy 
work environment is a positive work environment. Such an environment 
can be created by focusing on:

zz Paying adequate attention to the individual employee’s needs and 
expectations in addition to organisational needs

zz Building a positive work climate

zz Motivating individuals

zz Being fair and treating people equally

zz Ensuring and facilitating technical competence

zz Providing an attractive and safe work environment

zz Making the job interesting and challenging

zz Matching the person to the task

zz Delegating wherever necessary

zz Fostering team spirit and team responsibility

zz Developing employees through training, building confidence, 
feedback, encouragement and praise, support, positive reinforcement 
and involvement

zz Empowering employees, giving them authority wherever appropriate

zz Sustained opportunities for self-development

All of this can help the employer to boost the morale of those involved 
in the organisation/ work place.  In short, any wise employer / manager 
recognises that people are assets and are the ultimate valuable resource. 
Hence creating an environment where employees feel a sense of loyalty to 
the organisation and organisational development is as important as self 
development.

It is important not only to focus on the pay package but also to look 
at the entire life holistically. It is not how much you make that matters. 
What is important is whether or not you are able to live your life in a 
happy way. Look at your life as a whole. Think about your free time, your 
family, your friends, etc. This will help you to reach retirement age without 
remorse and regret about why you did not spend them on things that were 
more important.

One of the prerequisites is to possess and hone certain life skills that 
will help us to function effectively, with minimum stress and maximum 
productivity in personal and professional lives.

Life Skills for Livelihood 

Life skills are abilities for adaptive and positive behaviour that enable 
individuals to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of 
everyday life. 

Why are life skills important? Life skills help people to deal with the 
demands and challenges of everyday life.  They are important because 
they apply across the life span and promote and protect life, health and 
well-being in all situations. According to the World Health Organisation, 
life skills are thinking, coping, and social skills, which are abilities that 
can enhance people’s interactions with others and with the environment, 
and which may even give rise to greater individual resilience in situations 
of adversity.

Ten core sets of skills have been identified by experts:

Self-awareness  Empathy

Communication Interpersonal relationships

Decision making Problem solving

Creative thinking Critical thinking

Coping with emotions Coping with stress

Life skills are abilities that enable people to behave in healthy ways, 
particularly in situations that challenge them. It is important to develop 
appropriate skills as indicated above, in order to prevent manifesting 
unhealthy or negative behaviour. Appropriate and adequate knowledge, 
attitudes and values enable one to develop healthy life skills, and prevent 
negative health behaviour as indicated in the conceptual model below:

Knowledge Life Skills Psychosocial Positive Prevention 

Attitudes Competence Health of Negative 

Values & Behaviour Behaviour

18

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



Life skills enable people to act in ways that can contribute to personal 
and social changes for the promotion of their own health and development, 
as well as that of the communities in which they live. They are needed by 
individuals to function effectively and constructively in society. They include 
personal and social skills and help the person to function confidently and 
competently in their families and in society. Life skills are competencies 
and actual behaviours which cannot be taught in a classroom; rather 
experiential learning helps people to acquire them.

Improving One’s Own Work Life 

Improving work life in totality is crucial for the organisation. However, 
it is more vital for each individual to consciously improve one’s work life 
and thereby ensure job satisfaction and enhanced quality and quantity of 
output. Quality of work life from the perspective of the employee/worker 
is not so much about the job alone but also about how it is perceived by 
him/her. Towards this it is important to look at one’s work as a source 
of energy, fulfilment and learning. Some general tips in this context are 
given herein:

zz Develop healthy personal habits. Take care of one’s body, mind 
and spirit, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, by eating a wholesome 
diet, taking adequate and appropriate exercise and getting enough 
sleep. Such a lifestyle is helpful to face challenges and pressures at 
the workplace.

zz Be empathetic and compassionate. Interacting with peers, subordinates 
and supervisors is inevitable and calls for empathetic approach, 
which in turn will yield positive outcomes.

zz All persons at work have to remember the interdependence on 
each other, personally, professionally and psychologically. Positive 
attitudes and behaviour and interactions with peers, subordinates 
and supervisors will generate goodwill all round. People who help 
each other tend to experience greater satisfaction and reward and 
help a person to fulfil her / his own needs. Good communication and 
interpersonal skills are vital for successful completion of tasks and 
career development.

zz It is important to maintain loyalty and commitment to the organisation 
and to be professionally ethical at all times.

zz Encourage partnerships and work as a member of a team. 

zz People who help each other in this way tend to experience greater 
satisfaction and reward. Interactions with others should generate 

19

Reprint 2025-26

Unit I - Work, Livelihood and Career



results for mutual benefit. Work in collaboration with others, 
respecting and recognising their contributions and achievements.

zz It is wise to be responsive to situations and not reactive. For example, 
when faced with a reprimand at work by a senior, it is appropriate 
to respond by examining the situation realistically and calmly, 
rather than react with justifications and emotional outbursts. If 
the reprimand is deserved, one should take corrective measures, 
including apologising, if necessary. 

zz Flexibility, adaptability and problem-solving attitude and skills are core 
abilities essential in the work arena, whether you are self-employed 
or working for others. 

zz Be a good citizen and create a healthy community around you. 

zz People who follow these tips tend to attract like-minded persons. 
Together, they can often create a community of like-minded folks 
who strive to get the job done while serving everybody’s needs. For 
job satisfaction, be a good citizen within your organisation, recognise 
others for their achievements and work in collaboration with others 
to effect responsible change.

zz Learn from the lessons of life. 

z Job satisfaction is all about taking those day-to-day challenges, 
pressures and upsetting situations and turning them into life lessons 
that allow you to grow and move on as a better, more fulfilled person 
and professional.

This balance between life and work is not easy to achieve but the ability 
to positively adapt to societal and environmental change is essential. In 
any occupation, core abilities/essential workplace skills are the basic 
requirements. They cannot be taught as ‘academic lessons’ in schools or 
colleges, but they are vital to enable persons to become competent, and 
have to be acquired and honed as one develops as a person.

Essential Soft Skills at Workplace

zz Working productively — The worker applies effective work habits 
and attitudes in his/her job and tasks. This requires sufficient 
knowledge, skills and expertise as well as experience. Productivity 
is also influenced by enthusiasm, zeal and dynamism. Involvement 
with the job and sense of belonging to the organisation are 
important factors.

zz Learning effectively — Every individual requires some necessary 
skills in reading, writing, and computing as well as skills 
in acquiring information within the field, and ability to use 
learning tools and strategies. Equally essential is the motivation 
to work hard and update oneself to keep pace with advances/ 
developments in one’s field in order to be acclaimed/ renowned 
in the field. 

zz Communicating clearly — Apply appropriate writing, speaking, 
and listening skills so that one can precisely convey information, 
ideas, and opinions. 

zz Working cooperatively — Every individual must work with others 
to complete tasks, solve problems, resolve conflicts, provide 
information, and offer support. Cultivate a sense of belonging to 
the organisation 

zz Thinking critically and creatively — Every successful person 
applies the principles and strategies of analytical thinking, 
critical evaluation, being innovative and creative.

zz Other skills required — Concentration, alertness, presence 
of mind, tactfulness, empathy, soft skills, abilities to train, to 
delegate and to get others to do their work, forethought and 
vision, and the ability to multitask.

Work, Ethics and Dignity of Labour

Work, whether a paid job or unpaid work in the home, as a caregiver, or in 
a volunteer capacity, is fundamental to human nature. Every human being 
is infinitely worthy; however, in modern times wealth is being given more 
importance. Whatever the type of work done, or the position held, or financial 
status, every person deserves respect. The Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights states that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and 
rights. Every individual, through his or her share of work, however big or 
small, contributes to the betterment of the society. 

21

Reprint 2025-26

Unit I - Work, Livelihood and Career



  Dignity of labour means that the person takes pride in whatever she/he 
does. Abraham Lincoln was the son of a farmer and rose from a penniless 
boy to become the President of the United States of America. Mahatma 
Gandhi was a shining example of the dignity of labour. He did sweeping, 
scavenging and cleaning in his ‘Ashram’ in Wardha. He never felt degraded 
or insulted in doing the jobs that some people consider inferior or menial. 
He used to clean his own toilet, to demonstrate the dignity of labour. 

In this context, it is necessary to remember that whatever a person 
does should be driven by values and ethics. Values and ethics provide 
behavioural rules. Values are beliefs, preferences, or assumptions about 
what is desirable or good for humans. Values affect how we practise. There 
are six important values: service, social justice, dignity and worth of all 
persons, importance of human relationships and integrity.

 Ethics are a formal system or set of rules which are explicitly adopted 
by a group of people, e.g., professional ethics, medical ethics. Ethics can 
be defined as ‘the rules or standards governing the conduct of a person or 
the members of a profession’. Being ethical at all times, earns respect of 
one’s colleagues or peers and encourages them also to be ethical. At the 
workplace, values and ethics help to reduce waste of time and money and 
simultaneously increase employee morale, confidence and productivity.

In all work settings, generic norms of ethics and dignity are applicable. 
However, young workers/children and senior citizens as well as the female 
workforce are special groups and their presence in the workplace has many 
implications and ramifications in terms of their own quality of life as well 
as the society at large.

Ergonomics
Ergonomics is the study of humans at work, in order to understand the 
complex interrelationships of people with their job requirements, methods 
of working, tools/equipment used and the environment. Ergonomics is 
derived from two Greek words — ‘ergon’ (work) and ‘nomics’ (natural 
laws). It may also be spoken of as ‘Human Factors Engineering’. In 
short, ergonomics is the study of work with the primary goal being to 
adapt the work environment to the worker. The objective is to generate 

22

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



working conditions that are not hazardous to human health, are 
acceptable to the workers / the work force and are optimal for work output 
and productivity.

Ergonomics is “Adjustment of human 
and Machine�. It involves application of 
human biological sciences  combined with 
engineering science to achieve optimum 
mutual adjustment of human  work, with 
the benefit being measured in terms of 
human efficiency and well being.  Tools, 
machines and workstations are designed 
to fit the work so that stress and problems 
reduce stress and health problems.

   

Important aspects that are considered by ergonomists are in relation 
to worker capacity (both physiological and psychological), task demands 
(comprising nature and complexity, force required, duration, posture) and 
the work environment (noise, humidity, vibration, light, temperature). The 
science of ergonomics is set on the four pillars, namely anthropometry 
(body size and measurements), biomechanics (musculoskeletal activities 
and forces exerted), physiology and industrial psychology. 

Need for ergonomics:

conditions.

Benefits of Ergonomics
z Reduces risk of injury and accidents

z Increases productivity

z Reduces mistakes and need to do the work again

z Increases efficiency
z Decreases absenteeism due to ill health / accidents / stress

z Improves morale of workers.

The importance of ergonomics can be illustrated with a simple example. 
For a person who does office work, sitting on a chair that does not conform 
to ergonomic safety specifications can cause back pain. According to 
ergonomic principles, it is necessary that the chair height and stand be 
adjustable to the user’s height and body measurements. The number of 
chair legs must be suitable to its size to avoid falling. 

Any ergonomics intervention must be viewed in light of its effect 
on productivity, and the best ergonomics solutions will often improve 
productivity. Simply put, reducing unnecessary or awkward postures 
and exertions almost necessarily reduces the time it takes to complete a 
given task, thus improving productivity. Creating a safe and productive 
work environment is critical for any work place. Employees represent an 
organisation’s most important asset. When a task is matched with the 
ability of the people who will perform it, they will make fewer errors and 
produce less waste. Ergonomic design considerations have been shown to 
influence employee productivity and retention. 

We have discussed at length various employment-related aspects that 
are pertinent to livelihoods and productive professional careers. At this 
juncture, it is necessary to also direct attention to the exciting possibility 
of self-employment, personal enterprise and entrepreneurship. Self-
employment and innovative entrepreneurial ventures can be challenging, 
stimulating and highly rewarding; hence they merit attention as an avenue 
for building satisfying careers.

Entrepreneurship

Entrepreneurship is the act of creating a new and innovative enterprise/ 
product or service. The function of entrepreneurs is to change the pattern 
of a production or design of a product through innovations / invention or 
even attempting new technological methods/modifications for producing 
a new commodity or producing an old one in a new way. An entrepreneur 
is a person who undertakes the creation of such changes in an enterprise 
or business. Entrepreneurs use their acumen to assemble resources and/
or finances and aim to make a livelihood. This may even result in new 
organisations or may be part of revitalising existing organisations. 

An entrepreneur is a person who can take risks for converting a novel 
idea into reality. An entrepreneur is innovative, creative, organised, and 
risk taker. India has excellent examples of entrepreneurs who had the 
vision and thought e.g., Mr. Narayan Murthy, JRD Tata, Dhirubhai Ambani 
to name only a few.

Entrepreneurial activities differ depending on the type of organisation 
that is being started. Entrepreneurship ranges from small individual 
projects / micro units, sometimes involving the entrepreneur only part-
time,  to major undertakings which give jobs to many people in addition 
to the entrepreneur himself / herself. Many kinds of organisations now 
exist to support aspiring entrepreneurs, including government agencies, 
scientific institutes and organisations, financial institutions, such as 
banks and some voluntary organisations. 

Entrepreneurs make things happen:

zz May be a concept, product, policy or institution.

zz They become champions of new process(es), 
engineers of change 

Characteristics of Entrepreneurs 

An entrepreneur must necessarily have some personal attributes that 
enable him to take on the challenges of an enterprise. These include:

zz Willingness to work hard 

zz Knowledge and skills for planning and implementation

zz Skills of management of finances, materials, personnel and time
25

Reprint 2025-26

Unit I - Work, Livelihood and Career



zz Having the courage to take calculated risks

zz Ability and preparedness to handle many tasks simultaneously

zz Ability to learn and acquire the necessary skills for the tasks at hand

zz Ability to deal with tough issues and find the solutions
zz Being realistic and not expecting easy solutions

zz Ability to cope with set-backs, challenges and failures

zz Ability to develop partnerships, and able networking

zz Ability to negotiate, strategise and prioritise

zz Being flexible and able to handle crises
zz Have good communication skills.

In short, to achieve his / her objectives, the entrepreneur must 
be innovative, creative and goal-oriented. The entrepreneur must be 
ready to initiate direct action and be motivated to seek and adopt more 
effective means of doing things. Recently,  more comprehensive and 
holisitic conceptualisations of entrepreneurship have emerged wherein 
entrepreneurship is seen as a specific mindset resulting in different 
forms of entrepreneurial initiatives such as social entrepreneurship and 
knowledge entrepreneurship. 

Social entrepreneurship focusses on doing social good.  The social 
entrepreneur aims to achieve large scale benefits through entrepreneurship 
for a specific group or to society at large. Generally, the social entrepreneur 
works for the benefit of the underserved, neglected, disadvantaged groups 
or individuals who do not have the financial resources to achieve the benefit 
by themselves.  Social entrepreneurs are ‘social catalysts’, visionaries who 
create basic social changes and sustainable improvements. Such actions 
may have the potential to stimulate global improvements in their specifically 
selected areas, be it education, health care, economic development, the 
environment, the arts, or any other social field. The success of social 
entrepreneurship is ascertained not so much by the profits made but more 
by the social benefits and impact.

NUTRITION, FOOD SCIENCE 

AND TECHNOLOGY

Unit I - Work, Livelihood and Career



Our life is centred around food. Food is more than a biological necessity. 
It contributes to our cultural identity, is a part of social and religious 
practices. Food also enables us to realise our creativity, is a symbol of 
hospitality, status and power, among many other things. Our food choices 
have far reaching effects. Food nourishes the body, promotes growth, 
enables it to function and builds resistance to infection. If we eat nutritious 
and wholesome food, our bodies can function optimally. Thus knowledge 
about food and nutrition is essential. 

Food and Nutrition / Food Science and Nutrition is a broad domain 
consisting of several sciences that are distinct yet interrelated. As you 
know, nutrition influences our health, well being and quality of life. Are 
you aware that nutrition plays a significant role even before birth and 
that it affects the health of an individual throughout life? Have you ever 
thought of yourself as a biological being, that your body is made up of 
carefully arranged atoms, molecules, cells, tissues and organs? Every cell 
is regularly and continually replaced, some after a few days, some after 
months and some after years, although your external appearance may 
be relatively unchanged. For all these internal and external processes, 
nutrients are required and food is the source of these nutrients. 

However, many people do not have the correct knowledge; some do not 
get adequate food to eat, some overeat, others have wrong food choices 
because of various reasons, thus leading to malnutrition. In India, the 
proportion of undernourished persons has been high, but in recent years, 
prevalence of overnutrition is gradually increasing and many people 
are now suffering from health problems such as obesity, heart disease, 
hypertension, diabetes. Infectious diseases still continue to take their toll. 
Nutrition is the cornerstone for promotion of health as well as prevention 
and management of numerous disease conditions. Trained dietitians/
medical nutrition therapists are required to give advice about diet and 
nutrition to the individual as well as the community. Trained public health 
nutritionists are required to tackle public nutrition and health problems 
at regional, national and international levels, for planning-implementing-
monitoring-evaluating various strategies and programmes.

India is a major producer of fruits and vegetables, milk, etc., but almost 
1/5th to 1/3rd of the produce is wasted. This calls for concerted action 
to prevent spoilage, preserve, process and convert foods into a variety of 
forms. Cost of production in India is less than in many other countries and 
foreign direct investment is high. Therefore, food processing industry has 
been termed as the ‘sunrise sector’ of the Indian economy. Simultaneously 
socio-economic and socio-cultural changes/transitions in the country 
have tremendously increased the demand for ready to eat and processed 

30 foods. Besides this, the increasing prevalence of disease has necessitated 

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



development of foods for managing disease conditions. This has increased 
the demand for trained personnel who can undertake development, 
manufacture and marketing of various processed foods. 

Increasing number of persons travel outside the home daily for 
education, work, tourism. Also those who live in institutions of various 
kinds such as old age homes, hospitals, orphanages, school and college 
hostels, prisons, ashrams need to be fed daily. Nutritious, wholesome 
and safe food needs to be prepared and catered. This requires expertise 
which can be achieved through appropriate training. With increasing 
tourism, interest in ethnic foods and cuisinology, there is demand for 
qualified persons.

However, availability of foods with varying shelf life is not enough. Safety 
of the foods is crucial. ‘Safety culture’ of any organisation is important, be 
it food processing/manufacturing/catering industry. Indian government 
therefore has introduced several legislations and standards of food safety 
from time to time. Ensuring that all consumers have access to safe, good 
quality food, will require persons trained in food quality and safety. 

The five areas dealt in this Unit will acquaint you with basic concepts 
in each of these areas, give you insights about the professions and the 
knowledge and skills you need to acquire for each of these.

Clinical Nutrition 
and Dietetics

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, the learner will be able to:

zz understand and describe the significance and scope of clinical 
nutrition and dietetics.

zz describe the role and function of a dietitian/clinical nutritionist/ 
medical nutrition therapist. 

zz explain the knowledge and skills required for a career in clinical 
nutrition and dietetics.

Introduction

Nutrition is the science of food, nutrients and other substances as well as 
their digestion, absorption and utilisation by the body. Nutrition is also 
concerned with the social, psychological and economic aspects of food and 
eating.  It is well known that optimum nutrition is important for providing 
immunity and protection from infection, and to promote recovery from a 
variety of illnesses as well as managing chronic diseases. When nutrient 
intakes are inadequate, the body has difficulty in maintaining immune 
defences, healing wounds, utilising medications, supporting organ 
functions. Such persons may fall victims to additional complications. 
Nutrition is also important in disease states. In some diseases, nutrition 
plays a major role in management and treatment, and for some it 

Reprint 2025-26



complements the medical treatment. Nutritional status and support, prior 
to and after illness, play an important role in prognosis, recovery and even 
duration of hospitalisation. Also, illness and disease can result in nutrient 
imbalances even in a person who previously had good nutritional status. 
Thus health and nutrition are intimately interlinked. Poor nutrition 
not only leads to health problems but can also make existing problems 
worse.  The specialised area of nutrition which deals with nutrition during 
illness is ‘Clinical Nutrition’. In recent times, this field is called Medical 
Nutrition Therapy.

Significance
Nutritional care has gained importance worldwide, more so in recent times. 
Health problems/illness/disease and their treatment can affect nutritional 
status in a variety of ways: by impairing a person’s ability to eat and/or 
swallow, by interfering with digestion, absorption and metabolism as well 
as excretion. Even if one function is initially affected, in some individuals, 
if the health problem intensifies, other body functions may be affected. 
Clinical nutrition focusses on the nutritional management of patients with 
established disease.  

It must be borne in mind that function of any organ/tissue/system 
of the body can be affected due to disease, which can lead to minor and 
acute to major and sometimes, chronic or long lasting problems. In all 
these conditions, it is important to ensure that the person is adequately 
nourished and the person who delivers this service is a trained dietitian/
medical nutrition therapist/clinical nutritionist. The professional clinical 
nutritionist/dietitian uses a systematic and logical approach to the 
nutrition care process, focussing on each person/patient’s unique needs 
and addresses them in an individualistic and holistic manner. The patient 
is the primary focus of the nutritional care process. 

The 20th and 21st centuries have witnessed tremendous advances in 
the field of medicine and pharmacology, enabling us to control many 
communicable and infectious diseases. However, newer diseases such 
as HIV/AIDS have emerged. Prevalence of non-communicable diseases 
such as obesity, heart disease, hypertension and diabetes is not only 
increasing, but these are occurring at a much younger age. In fact, 
India is likely to be the diabetes ‘capital’ of the world. Further, older 
persons require special attention. Thus, the proportion of population 
which requiresnutritional care, support and diet counseling is increasing. 
The clinical nutritionist/medical nutrition therapist plays an important 
role in preventionof diseases and promotion of good health, besides 
recommending therapeutic diets for management of various diseases.

nutritional assessment are being developed and adopted, newer 
techniques and supplements for nourishing the patient are being 
used. With advances in the food and pharmaceutical industry basic 
research in nutrition has shed light on the role of various nutrients and 
other substances such as nutraceuticals, phytochemicals / bioactive 
substances resulting in the growth of the discipline of clinical nutrition. 
Researchers and scientists continue to discover the role of individual 
nutrients ranging from a role in gene expression, metabolic regulation 
and in the prevention and treatment of disease. For example, antioxidants 
like beta-carotene, selenium, vitamin E and vitamin C, particularly from 
food, appear to have a protective role. 

According to the FSSAI, foods for special dietary uses or functional 
foods or nutraceuticals or health supplements means foods which 
are specially processed or formulated to satisfy particular dietary 
requirements which exist because of a particular physical or 
physiological condition or specific diseases and disorders and which 
are presented as such, wherein the composition of these foodstuffs 
must differ significantly from the composition of ordinary foods of 
comparable nature, if such ordinary foods exist, and may contain one 
or more of the following ingredients, namely:

 (i) plants or botanicals or their parts in the form of powder, 
concentrate or extract in water, ethyl alcohol or hydro alcoholic 
extract, single or in combination;

 (ii) minerals or vitamins or proteins or metals or their compounds 
or amino acids (in amounts not exceeding the Recommended 
Daily Allowance for Indians) or enzymes (within permissible 
limits);

 (iii) substances from animal origin;
 (iv) a dietary substance for use by human beings to supplement 

the diet by increasing the total dietary intakes.

Medical foods are those products that are specially manufactured for 
persons with specific needs. Such foods are regulated and can be used 
only with a doctor’s prescription for the specific dietary management 
of a disease or condition. 

Phytochemicals/Bioactive compounds are non-nutrient constituents 
present in foods that have physiological or biological activity and 
influence health.

Basic Concepts 

The dietitian/ medical nutrition therapist’s role is to provide advice and 
34

translate technical information into dietary guidelines. They provide advice

to patients and if necessary, give prescriptions to healthy individuals at 
different stages of the life cycle, from the womb to the tomb (i.e., pregnancy, 
infancy and childhood up to old age) in order to help them maintain good 
nutritional status and remain healthy. Besides this, nutrition and diet 
therapy are used to improve the overall health of patients with a wide 
range of conditions. Examples of these conditions are diarrhea, vomiting, 
food allergies, anemia, fever, typhoid, tuberculosis, ulcers, hyperacidity 
and heart burn, epilepsy, gastrointestinal problems, AIDS, hypertension, 
cancer, osteoporosis, obesity, burns, metabolic disorders, including 
diabetes, and kidney, liver, and pancreatic disorders. Patients who are to 
undergo surgery also need pre and post operative nutritional intervention/
support. Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics, therefore, is concerned with nutritional 
requirements of patients suffering from different diseases and prescribing the 
right type of diet for them. The objectives of diet therapy  are:

 (i) promotion of recovery formulation of the diet to meet the needs of 
the patient taking into consideration her or his food habits.

 (ii) modification of the existing diets to ameliorate the disease condition 
and to keep it under control; 

 (iii) correction of nutritional deficiencies; if any
 (iv) prevention of short-term and long-term complications in case of 

chronic diseases;

 (v)  education and counselling of the patient regarding the need to 
adhere to the prescribed diet.

A dietitian also needs to look at the effect of illness on food acceptance and 
utilisation. Some of the factors that are considered include (a) nutritional 
stress (b) psychological stress (c) effect of illness on food acceptance and 
(d) acceptability of modified therapeutic diets.
Thus, Nutritional care during illness is an organised group of activities and 
consists of :

zz Assessing nutritional status

zz Diagnosis of nutritional problems

zz Planning and prioritising nutrition intervention(s) to meet 
nutritional needs 

zz Monitoring and evaluating nutritional care outcomes and making 
changes if necessary.

The nutritional care process is applied to individuals or groups in any 
setting from healthy persons who are clients of fitness/wellness centres/ 
programmes, pregnant women, elderly persons, persons being treated for 
illness in private physicians’ clinics to hospitalised patients, regardless of 

35
whether they are in municipal, government, charitable or private hospitals. 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit II - Nutrition, Food Science 
And Technology



A study of clinical nutrition and dietetics enables the professional to:

zz Plan diets appropriately to meet the nutritional requirements at 
various stages of the life cycle.

zz Modify diets in various disease conditions, keeping in mind the 
physical state, occupation, cultural, ethnic and socio-economic 
background, the treatment regimen and the individual’s likes and 
dislikes.

zz Plan diets for athletes/sports persons, for individuals in special 
situations such as nutrition in space, persons working in submarines, 
defence personnel, industrial workers, etc.

zz Promote health and well-being of patients admitted to hospital or in 
outpatient clinics as well as in institutional settings.

zz Manage food services in a variety of institutional settings such as old 
age homes, schools, orphanages etc.

zz Help patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease 
in management, to prevent complications and improve quality of life.

zz Promote better health in the community and better efficacy of 
services in health care institutions/ establishments in terms of better 
patient care management, holistic care, and contribute to better 
survival and recovery.

Nutritional assessment is required to obtain information on the 
patient’s nutritional status and nutrient needs. It involves:

zz Obtaining detailed  information on health, diet, personal and 
medication histories

zz Anthropometric measurements

zz Relating the information on laboratory and physical measurements 
with the above and the physician’s diagnosis

zz Interpreting all of the above to identify potential nutritional 
deficiencies and risk of future deficiencies.

It must be borne in mind that physicians are ultimately responsible 
for ensuring that all the patient’s medical needs are met. Based on the 
doctors’ diagnosis of the disease condition and the nutritional assessment 
done, the dietitian prescribes the diet, ensures provision of food in the 
hospital according to the diet restrictions and provides dietary counseling 
to the patient. For the implementation of the diet prescription, the 
physician relies on the dietitian/medical nutrition therapist. Today, the 
field of clinical nutrition has evolved into a practice that is increasingly 
incorporated into mainstream medical treatment and the deititian forms 

36
an integral part of the medical team.

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



The dietitian has the primary responsibility for ensuring that the 
patient receives appropriate diet and optimal nutritional care, after 
assessing the nutritional status of the patients, analysing nutrient needs 
(nutritional requirements change in different illness/disease states) and 
developing the nutrition care plan by administering suitable regimens 
to patients who are hospitalised or counseling those in the outpatient 
department (OPD).

Both normal and therapeutic diets are planned to maintain or restore 
good nutrition in the individual. This is done by the medical nutrition 
therapist/dietitian taking into account the food pattern and frequency of 
intake of different types of food, diagnosis of disease and prescription given 
by the doctor, the health status and physical condition including ability 
to eat, chew, swallow, digest and absorb the food eaten, feeling of hunger, 
physical activity and life style, dietary and other supplements consumed, 
cultural/ethnic practices and religious beliefs.

Let us get acquainted with some basic terms used by clinical nutritionists 
and dietitians.

Types of Diets : Any nutritional care plan involves providing for adequate 
intake of all nutrients vis-à-vis the requirements based on age, sex, 
physiological state, occupation and health status.

zz A standard, normal or regular diet is one that includes all groups of 
foods and meets the needs of healthy individuals. However, in the 
hospitals a regular diet would be low in fried fatty foods, sweets, 
spices and condiments.

zz Modified diets are those that are adjusted to meet the medical 
needs of a patient, which may involve one or more of the following: 
(1) change in consistency and/or texture (e.g., fluid and soft diets), 
(2) an increase or decrease in the energy intake, (3) include greater 
or lesser amounts of one or more nutrients e.g., increase in protein 
intake in case of surgery, lower protein intake in case of kidney 
failure, high or low in fibre, lower fat intake, restriction in sodium 
intake, restriction in fluid intake, restricted intake of  certain foods as 
these may be rich in a non-nutritive dietary constituent e.g., spinach, 
because spinach is rich in oxalates, and (4) change in the number 
of meals, or modification in intervals of feeding or special plan for 
patients when route of feeding is altered.  

Changes in Consistency: Depending on the condition, patients may be 
advised liquid, soft or regular diet (i) Liquid diets are primarily fluid in 
consistency at room temperature. Also known as full fluid diets, these 
include foods which are free from fibre and are nutritionally adequate. The 
advantage is that the nutrients are easily absorbed if the gastrointestinal 

37
tract is functioning normally. Such a diet is advised for persons who are 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit II - Nutrition, Food Science 
And Technology



unable to chew or swallow normally. For example, coconut water, fruit 
juice, soup, milk, buttermilk, milk shakes, etc. A variation of this is also 
clear liquid diet, which is even more thin in consistency, e.g., clear soups 
or juices (without pulp), very light tea, etc. Clear liquid diet is prescribed 
just after surgery. However, the limitation is that it is not easy to meet the 
nutritional requirements of the person completely. (ii) Soft diets provide 
semi-solid foods that are lightly seasoned, do not contain much fibrous 
or gas forming foods. Such diets are easy to chew and digest. Examples 
of foods included in soft diets are khichdi, sago kheer, etc. Foods included 
should minimise the risk of indigestion, abdominal distention, nausea, 
cramping or any other gastrointestinal problems. 

There are certain modifications we make even for normal adults in 
the older age group. This is called mechanical soft diet which includes 
soft, mashed and pureed foods for the elderly with problems in chewing. 
A soft diet, on the other hand, is a therapeutic modification. It is soft 
in consistency and includes only simple, easily digestible food with no 
harsh fibre, high fat or spicy foods. Such diets are given when rest to the 
digestive system is recommended.

Feeding Routes:  The best and most preferred way / route for feeding 
the patient is orally or by mouth. However, there are patients who may 
not be able to chew or swallow e.g., if the person is unconscious or if 
there is a problem with the esophagus. For such individuals there are two 
options (a) tube feeding which is introdussed through the nose into the 
stomach or (b) intravenous feeding. In tube feeding, nutritionally complete 
feeds are delivered through a tube. These are preferred over intravenous 
feeding which is introduced through the nose into the stomach as long 
as the gastrointestinal tract is functional and the person is able to digest 
and absorb whatever is fed. Intravenous feeding means that the patient is 
nourished with special solutions which are given through a drip in a vein. 

Prevention of Chronic Diseases: Besides being important for persons 
with disease, diet and good nutrition (as well as a healthy lifestyle) can 
control and delay the age of onset of chronic diseases. The foods we 
consume today, especially processed foods, contain many additives, are 
high in fat and/or sugar, often are prepared from highly refined foods and 
are therefore low in fibre and many other important constituents which 
confer health benefits. This is why we need help in making appropriate 
choices.

Can you identify the types of changes that have occurred in the diets 
of urban Indians over the past decade? It is seen that fat consumption has 
increased, refined sugar consumption has increased. There is a reduced 
intake of fibre as well as several vitamins and minerals. In non-vegetarian 

38 populations, consumption of animal protein has also increased.

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



What are the consequences of these dietary changes? Broadly speaking, 
such changes have been associated with increased incidence of chronic 
diseases such as obesity, cancer of the colon, diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease and hypertension. For example, the increase in sugar and fat 
consumption, along with the decrease in fibre consumption and less 
physical activity, play a role in causing of obesity and diabetes. It has also 
been found that high consumption of  highly salted convenience foods, 
processed foods with high sodium content,  decreased intake of potassium-
rich fruits, vegetables, grains and legumes, possibly low calcium intakes, 
less physical activity as well as stress are associated with increased risk of 
hypertension (high blood pressure).

Clinical nutritionists can play a very important role in preventing 
development of such problems by providing appropriate diet counselling 
and guidance. They can also be appointed for guidance to various groups 
such as schools and colleges, etc.

E Scientists have found connection between diet and disease. 
X For example in a clinical study of 20,000 men, consuming fish 
E once a week was linked to a 52 per cent reduction in the risk of 
R sudden death from heart attack. Fish is high in omega-3 fatty 
C acids, which are essential components of cells and can protect 
I the heart from abnormal heart rhythm.
S
E In another clinical study of more than 42,000 women, those who 

ate lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, 
and only lean meats lived longer. High intake of fruits, vegetables, 

1 and legumes was associated with a lower risk of developing heart 
disease.

What can you conclude about (a) role of the diet in disease 
causation? (b) role of the diet in disease prevention?

Preparing for a career

The professional clinical nutritionist or dietitian must have:

zz Knowledge of physiological changes in disease conditions, changes 
in RDAs/nutrient requirements in illness and types of dietary 
modifications required, traditional and ethnic cuisines.

zz Skills in assessing nutritional status of patients using clinical and 
biochemical criteria, diet planning customised to requirements of 
individual patients and specific disease conditions, recommending and 
administering diets to patients, communication for diet counselling, 

39
adapting to cultural milieu, food taboos and overcoming fads/myths.

And Technology



It is absolutely essential to have knowledge (both theoretical and 
practical) of the subject areas of nutrition, food science, food composition, 
clinical nutrition and dietetics or the more recently used terminologies 
such as medical nutrition therapy or medical nutrition management. 
For this, the clinical nutritionist and dietitian needs to have thorough 
knowledge and understanding of the basic biological and physical sciences 
including chemistry, biology, physiology, biochemistry. Since food safety, 
especially in institutional settings, is critical, s/he must have knowledge of 
microbiology and food microbiology and safety, food quality and assurance, 
food laws and regulations, physics to be able to effectively use and ensure 
maintenance of the various equipments used in food preparation, storage 
and service. Knowledge of food service management including quantity 
food production is essential. Basic knowledge and understanding of 
bookkeeping and accounts, record–keeping, management, especially 
personnel management, are important. One of the most important aspects 
of the job profile of a dietitian is counselling patients. Disease changes 
the body and mind. It can have a major impact on both the physiological 
and mental/emotional condition of the body. Counselling is an art and a 
science. A dietitian requires knowledge of psychology, sociology, education 
and counselling in order to become a good diet counsellor.

Clinical nutritionists would need to have additional knowledge of 
epidemiology and the patterns of prevalence and incidence of nutritional 
disorders and diseases, skills in surveying patient populations, laboratory 
research using biochemical parameters, skill in conducting experimental 
research with patients to find out the usefulness of various diets, drugs 
and nutritional supplements.  

Preparing for a Career 

In order to choose any of the career options offered by Clinical Nutrition 
and Dietetics, you need to have passed 10+2 level followed by completion 
of a B.Sc. degree in Home Science or B.Sc. with a specialisation in 
Nutrition / Food Technology. In case you want to be a dietitian you must at 
least complete a Postgraduate Diploma in Dietetics with an internship to 
qualify to be a registered dietitian. Those who have a B.Sc. degree in Home 
Science, Life Sciences, Biochemistry, Microbiology or Biotechnology can 
enter this area at the Postgraduate Diploma level. M.Sc. in Food Science 
and Nutrition or Dietetics  helps one to specialise in this field and are 
preferred in many places of employment A dietitian, after finishing her/his 
university education, can go further and qualify to obtain the credential 
of a “Registered Dietitian”. Many countries have regulatory laws regarding 
this. If you choose a career focussing on teaching and research, a number 
of options open up in universities, colleges and research institutions. In 

40 order to qualify for teaching posts it is now essential to successfully clear 

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



the National or State Eligibility Tests conducted by University Grants 
Commission (UGC). It is advisable to complete your Ph.D. too in case you 
want to pursue a career in academics or research.

Scope

Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics offers rich scope and potential for a 
satisfying career as a dietitian, diet counsellor, teacher, researcher or 
corporate consultant. The primary career and wellness possibilities in this 
field include becoming a dietitian, diet counsellor or clinical nutritionist 
engaged in research and/or teaching. Besides this, clinical nutritionists also 
have career opportunities in the food industry, research and development 
(R&D) and production of medical foods, nutraceuticals, tube feeds, various 
types of nutritional support formulations or functional foods. 

If you have a keen interest in improving the way in which we use food 
to control, prevent and treat disease conditions, clinical nutrition and 
dietetics is the field you should choose. Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics has 
a promising future. While most of us have an idea of the role of dietitians 
and diet counsellors, we may not be aware that there is expanding scope 
for research into the physiological and psychosocial changes brought 
about by disease conditions. The relevance of nutritional considerations 
in preventing, treating and curing different types of disease conditions is 
being increasingly accepted. Research has led to the development of drugs 
and nutritional supplements, rehabilitation of patients in community 
settings; development of dietary guidelines and nutrition education.

Further, clinical nutritionist can have a role in delineation of public 
policy, in designing and implementing preventive and promotive nutrition 
programmes to tackle nutritional deficiency disorders. You could expect 
jobs as a dietitian in hospitals/ clinics, wellness centre, gyms, slimming 
clinics with consultants, teacher / faculty  in a university or college, 
researcher in medical research establishments and nutrition research 
laboratories, consultant in companies developing therapeutic foods and 
supplements, food service manager/ provider in hospitals etc. You can 
also work as a freelancer, diet consultant or dietitian running your own 
enterprise.

And Health

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter the learner will be able to:

zz understand the significance and scope of public nutrition.
zz have knowledge about the nutritional problems of public health 

significance.
zz be acquainted with the government programmes that are in operation 

to tackle important nutritional problems.
zz describe the role and functions of a public health nutritionist.
zz explain the knowledge and skills required for a career in public 

health nutrition.

Introduction

In Class XI you studied the basic concepts of nutrition and health, physical 
fitness and wellness. You must be aware of the importance of good 
nutrition as the foundation and cornerstone of health. So what is significant 
about the introduction of the word ‘public’ in this context? Let us find out. 
You are already familiar with the definition of health given by the World 
Health Organisation. The concept of public health refers to the collective 
action taken by society to protect and promote the health of the whole 
populations.

Reprint 2025-26



In Class XI, you were introduced to the terms undernutrition and 
overnutrition. The mission in public health nutrition is to prevent both 
undernutrition and overnutrition and to maintain optimal nutritional 
status of the population. 

Significance

Why do we need to focus on this specific aspect in the field of nutrition? 
Malnutrition is the underlying cause of at least 50 per cent deaths of 
children under five years of age. The statistics for nutrition-related 
problems in our country reveal an alarming situation:

zz Almost one-fifth of the infants born in India are low birth weight 
babies i.e., they weigh less than 2500g or 2.5kg. Low birth weight 
may have adverse effects throughout their growing years and may 
have adverse implications even in adult life. Low birth weight may 
even lead to child mortality.

zz There is widespread prevalence of growth retardation among pre-
schoolers (from socio-economically disadvantaged families) and almost 
half the children suffer from mild and moderate under nutrition.

zz A large proportion of children (and adults) suffers from micronutrient 
deficiencies in varying degrees of severity also known as hidden 
hunger. The micronutrients of most concern are iron, zinc, vitamin A, 
vitamin C, vitamin D, iodine, folic acid and B12.

If these problems are not controlled in time, they will not only affect 
physical growth which may lead to smaller body stature in adulthood, but 
may also affect mental and cognitive development. All of these, in turn, 
can have negative impact on productivity and quality of life. The costs of 
malnutrition are very high. Experts have estimated that productivity losses 
are more than 10 per cent of lifetime earnings for individuals and 2-3 
percent of gross domestic product for the nation. This clearly indicates that 
if we tackle malnutrition, we can help India to develop, grow economically 
and become a powerful nation.

India mostly faces the problem of under nutrition; however, the 
problem of over nutrition is also on the rise. Gradually, over the years, 
large numbers of persons have altered their dietary patterns and lifestyles. 
With respect to lifestyle, people have become more sedentary, relying on 
faster means of transportation, walking less and doing less amount of 
physical activity. In large cities, even children do not play enough outdoor 
games. Simultaneously dietary patterns have become less ‘healthful’. Food 
choices have become less ‘healthy’ because processed foods, fast foods, 

47

Reprint 2025-26

Unit II - Nutrition, Food Science 
And Technology



snacks, western type foods, e.g., burgers, pizzas, biscuits, chocolates, 
cakes and pastries, soft drinks, even Indian mithais, samosas, etc. (that 
are high in energy, sugar, fat, salt and low in other nutrients and fibre) 
are increasingly becoming part of the daily diet. At the same time, intake 
of whole grains, pulses, vegetables and fruits has reduced. All these lead 
to undesirable/inappropriate weight gain, overweight and obesity and 
ultimately lead to diseases such as hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, 
cancer, arthritis, among others. These diseases are non-communicable 
and take their toll not only on the physical health but also on quality of 
life, adding to the financial burden.

Thus India is said to face ‘the double burden of malnutrition’ i.e., 
coexistence of both undernutrition and overnutrition. Further, although 
communicable diseases like smallpox have been controlled, newer ones like 
HIV/AIDS and old ones like tuberculosis, hepatitis, malaria, are increasing 
in prevalence. The ultimate consequences of these communicable diseases 
are far worse for those who are not optimally nourished i.e., those who 
are undernourished and those who have lower immunity due to obesity, 
diabetes, HIV/AIDS, etc. This poses challenges for doctors, nutritionists 
and the government in terms of treatment, control and prevention.

There is a tremendous need for a trained cadre of public health 
professionals including public health nutritionists, to address and solve 
these problems. Let us first acquaint ourselves with what is public health 
nutrition.

Basic Concepts

What is Public Health Nutrition?

Public health nutrition is the field of study that is concerned with promotion 
of good health through prevention of nutrition–related illnesses / problems 
in the population, and the government policies and programmes that are 
aimed at solving these problems.  Public health nutritionists / professionals 
use large scale, organised and multidisciplinary approaches to solve the 
problems that affect the population i.e., large number of people for whom 
group action is necessary. Therefore, this field is multidisciplinary in nature 
and is built on the foundations of biological and social sciences. It differs 
from other fields of nutrition e.g. clinical nutrition and dietetics, because 
the professionals are required to address problems of the community /
public specially the vulnerable groups. Public Nutrition is a special body 
of knowledge derived from the nutritional, biological, behavioural, social 

48

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



and managerial sciences. It can also be described as the art and science of 
promoting health and preventing diseases, prolonging life, through the 
organised efforts/action of society.

A community is a specific group of people who share common 
characteristics, e.g. a common language, exposed to similar conditions, 
common lifestyle or the same health problem.

Any professional in the field of public nutrition has to promote good 
nutrition and /or to prevent nutritional problems, for which it is important 
to identify the problem and its magnitude , understand how and why these 
problems occur and then plan strategies and actions to implement them 
and evaluate their impact.        

In any society, nutritional problems are not just linked to food but to a 
variety of interacting/interrelated factors at various levels which have been 
summarised in Figure 3.1. While poverty is often the underlying cause, 
the situation becomes worse when a substantial proportion of families do 
not have access to basic amenities. Rural households have less access to 
toilets. Poor sanitation results in loss of work days and further economic 
loss. Further, considerable proportion of the population does not have 
safe drinking water. Working days are lost each year due to water borne 
diseases.

As shown in Figure 3.1, the factors related to nutritional problems range 
from economic factors (availability of financial resources), agricultural 
policy (production, price of various food stuffs), health care facilities/ 
services, their availability and access to the government policies, political 
will and socio-cultural factors. 
Nutritional Problems in India: It is important to have knowledge about the 
nutritional problems in our country. 
Let us discuss these in brief:

a) Protein- Energy Malnutrition(PEM) : Can be found in every society, even 
in developed and industrialised countries, although the numbers are 
fewer in the latter as compared to developing countries. It is caused 
by inadequate food intake vis–a–vis the requirements, i.e., insufficient 
intake of the macronutrients (energy and protein). Children are at 
greatest risk although PEM can occur in adults especially the elderly, 
as well as in some diseases e.g. T.B., AIDS, etc. It is assessed by 
evaluating the anthropometric measurements (weight, height, head-
chest circumference, etc.).

A person is said to be underweight when his/her body weight is less 
than adequate for his/her age. Stunting (short stature) is said to be 
present when the height is less than adequate for age. When weight is 
not adequate relative to height, it is termed ‘wasting’.

Severe undernutrition due to deficiency of food and energy is termed as 
‘marasmus’ and that caused by protein deficiency is termed ‘kwashiorkor’. 
b)	 Micronutrient	deficiencies: If the diet is deficient in energy and protein 

content it is also likely to contain inadequate amounts of other  nutrients 
especially micronutrients viz. minerals and vitamins.  The term “hidden 
hunger” is used to refer to micronutrient deficiency. The deficiencies 
of iron, vitamin A, iodine, zinc are of major public health concern. In 
addition, there is growing concern about deficiency of vitamin B12, 
folic acid, calcium, vitamin D and riboflavin. Some micronutrient 
deficiencies of public health concern are described below:

(i) Iron-deficiency	anemia	 (IDA): It is the most common nutritional 
disorder in the world and is prevalent in both developed and 
developing countries. The vulnerable groups are women in 
child–bearing age, adolescent girls, pregnant women and 
school age children. IDA occurs when hemoglobin production is 
considerably reduced and it results in low levels of hemoglobin 
in blood. Symptoms depend on the rate of fall in hemoglobin. 
Since hemoglobin is required for carrying oxygen in the body, any 
physical exertion leads to shortness of breath (breathlessness 
on slight exertion) and the person complains of fatigue and 
may feel lethargic. Manifestations of IDA include general pallor, 
paleness of conjunctiva of eyes, tongue and nail beds and soft 
palate. In children, cognitive functions (attention span, memory, 
concentration) are adversely affected. 

(ii)	 Vitamin	A	deficiency (VAD): Vitamin A is necessary for mainten-
ance of healthy epithelium, normal vision, growth and immunity. 
Deficiency of vitamin A results in night blindness which progresses 
to complete blindness if corrective measures are not taken. Also, 
there is less resistance to infection and growth may be adversely 
affected. There is a vicious cycle between vitamin A deficiency 
and infection. Vitamin A deficiency is the most common cause of 
childhood blindness.

(iii) Iodine	 deficiency	 disorders (IDD): Iodine is required for normal 
mental and physical growth and development. IDD is an 
ecological phenomenon, largely due to deficiency of iodine in 
the soil. Some of the states in India where IDD is common are–
Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh in the Himalayan 
belt, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra and 
Madhya Pradesh. The term ‘Iodine	 Deficiency Disorders’ refers 
to a spectrum of disabling conditions that affect the health of 
humans, from fetal life through adulthood due to inadequate dietary 
intake of iodine. Deficiency of iodine results in insufficient amount of 
thyroid hormone which is synthesised by the thyroid gland.

  Enlarged thyroid known as ‘goitre’ is the most common 
manifestation of iodine deficiency in adults. In children it manifests 
as cretinism. Iodine deficiency in adults during pregnancy has 
several adverse effects specially resulting in mental retardation 
and congenital abnormalities of the fetus. Unfortunately this 
effect is irreversible. IDD is estimated to affect about 13 per cent 
of the world’s population and about 30 per cent are at risk.

Strategies/intervention to tackle Nutritional Problems

As our former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh stated in one of his 
speeches “The problem of malnutrition is a matter of national shame …… I 
appeal to the nation to resolve and work hard to eradicate malnutrition in 
5 years”. There is a need to adopt a multi-disciplinary approach to solve 
nutritional problems. Government is making considerable efforts to solve 
the problems. POSHAN Abhiyaan or the PM’s Overarching Scheme for 
Holistic Nutrition was launched in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan in March 2018. 
It targets stunting, under-nutrition, anaemia (among young children, 
women and adolescent girls) and low birth rate. It is meant to monitor 
and review the implementation of all such schemes. Its large component 
involves gradual scaling-up of interventions  to all districts in the country 
by 2022. The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) is 
implementing POSHAN Abhiyaan in 315 districts in the first year, 235 
districts in the second year and remaining districts will be covered in the 
third year. Through robust multi-ministerial convergence mechanism and 
other components POSHAN ABHIYAN strives to create the synergy. Some 
direct short term interventions are: (a) Integrated Child Development 
Services (ICDS )to cover all vulnerable children in the age group of 0-6 
years and all pregnant and lactating mothers, (b) fortification of essential 
foods (salt fortified with iodine), (c) production and popularisation of low 
cost nutritious foods from indigenous and locally available raw material by 

53

And Technology



involving women in this activity and (d) control of micronutrient deficiencies 
among vulnerable groups, namely deficiencies of iron, vitamin A, folic acid 
and iodine among children, pregnant women and nursing mothers by 
supplementing these nutrients, distributing free tablets, etc.

Indirect policy instruments include long term strategies for achieving 
national goals through indirect institutional or structural changes such 
as: (a) ensuring food security i.e., improving availability of food, (b) 
improvement in dietary patterns by ensuring availability of nutritionally 
rich foods and (c) poverty alleviation for rural and urban poor through 
employment generation schemes and public distribution system, 
implementing land reforms, improving health and family welfare, prevention 
of food adulteration, involvement of media, basic nutrition and knowledge, 
monitoring of nutrition programmes, improvement of status of women, 
education and literacy and community participation. 

There are various strategies that can be used to combat public nutrition 
problems. They are broadly classified as:

a) Diet or food-based strategies
b) Nutrient-based approach or medicinal approach

Diet	or	food-based	strategies: They are preventive and comprehensive 
strategies that use food as a tool to overcome nutritional deficiencies. They 
can play an important role in preventing micronutrient deficiencies by 
increasing the availability and consumption of micronutrient-rich foods. 
One of the important advantages of this strategy is that it is sustainable 
and will have long-term benefits. Other benefits are that they are cost-
effective, can be adapted to different cultural and dietary traditions and 
very importantly they do not carry risk of overdose or toxicity which may 
happen in case of nutrient–based / medicinal approach. Some important 
food-based approaches include dietary diversification and modification, 
horticulture interventions e.g., home gardening, nutrition and health 
education, food fortification.

Nutrient-based or medicinal approach : In this approach nutrient 
supplements are given to vulnerable groups i.e., those who are at risk 
of deficiency and those who have deficiency. It is a short term strategy 
particularly used for vitamin A, iron and folic acid in India. Supplementation 
programmes are often expensive and there may be problems of coverage. 
Key target groups are different for various nutrients. 

Table 3.1 compares the two approaches. It must be remembered that 
the long-term goal should be to shift away from supplementation towards 
food-based approaches.

5. Self-employment and wage employment schemes.  
Self-employment and wage employment are social safety net programmes.
Health Care: Health is a fundamental human right. It is the responsibility 
of the government to provide adequate health care to the citizens. Health 
care is not just medical care but it includes a multitude of services that 
should help to promote, maintain, monitor or restore health.  In India, health 
care is provided at three levels : primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary 
level is the first level of contact of the individual, family or community with 
the health system. In our country, these services are provided through a 
network of primary health centres (PHCs). 

More complex health problems are resolved at the second level through 
district hospitals and community health centres. Community health 
centres function as the first referral level. Tertiary is the third and the 
highest level of health care. It deals with the more complex health problems 
that cannot be dealt with at the first two levels. Institutions at tertiary level 
are medical college hospitals, regional hospitals, specialised hospitals and 
All-India Institutes of Medical Sciences.

Scope

Role of Public Nutritionist: Nutrition is an important determinant 
of health. The changing health scenario globally has increased the 
challenges for public nutritionists. The public nutritionist (also called 
community nutritionist), who is well trained and equipped in key areas, 
is eminently suited to participate in all the strategies of health promotion 
and prevention. The key areas include nutritional science, nutritional 
needs throughout the life cycle, nutritional assessment, nutritional care, 
food science, educational methods, mass media and communication 
and programme management. A community nutritionist can work in the 
following areas/situations.

Introduction

Food items are being processed for various reasons. Since times immemorial, 
grains have been dried after harvest to increase their shelf life. Initially, 
foods were processed primarily to improve digestibility, palatability and 
to ensure a continuous supply. In India pickles, murabbas and papads 
are examples of preserved products made from certain vegetables/ fruits/
grains. With passage of time, improved transportation, communication 
and increasing industrialisation, the needs of consumers have become 

Reprint 2025-26



more diverse and there is now increasing demand for ‘fresh’ and ‘organic’ 
foods, ‘safer and healthier’ foods and foods with adequate shelf life. 
Consumers expect better-quality foods with retention of nutrients, many a 
time having specific functional properties and taste/texture/consistency, 
while being shelf-stable and easy to package, store and transport. This has 
served as a stimulus to scientists to develop methods and techniques to 
process foods in a manner that the food products will meet the requirements 
and demands of the consumers. All of us eat readymade foods. These range 
from biscuits, bread, pickles/papads to foods such as ready-to-eat curries, 
meal items, snacks, etc. Such foods are manufactured using a variety of 
processes and technologies. For some, simple traditional methods are still 
used while newer processes and technologies are employed to produce 
processed foods in bulk.

Significance:  India has progressed from an agro-deficit to an agro-
surplus country creating need for storage and processing of agricultural 
and horticultural produce. Indian food industry has thus emerged as 
a major producer of processed foods and ranks fifth in terms of size, 
contributing nearly 6 per cent of GDP. Besides, changes in lifestyle, 
increasing mobility and globalisation have increased the demands for 
various types of products, making the research for newer technologies 
necessary. It is well known that simple diets based largely on staple foods 
such as cereals are often deficient in certain nutrients leading to their 
deficiency disorders. Therefore, food fortification is done by adding the 
nutrient that is lacking in the food stuffs or condiments to ensure that 
minimum dietary requirements are met. Some examples are iodised salt, 
folic acid added to flour, vitamin A and D added to milk and oils/fats. In 
fact, FSSAI has laid down standards for fortification of staple food like salt, 
wheat flour, milk and oats. Increasing prevalence of diseases like heart 
disease and diabetes and concern about wellness, has made it necessary 
for scientists to alter the nutrient content of foods, for example reducing 
the Calorie content of processed foods in several ways such as using 
artificial sweeteners. Likewise fat from ice creams is replaced by specially 
treated proteins which give ice cream the smooth texture associated with 
fat but the energy value is reduced. Also, consumer perceptions about 
food have changed. The demand for foods free of chemicals, pesticides 
and preservatives, yet having a longer shelf life and retaining their natural 
flavour and appearance, is rapidly increasing. All this has increased the 
importance of food processing and technology as a discipline and there is 
a huge demand for food technologists.

Basic Concepts  

Food Science: It is a distinct field involving the application of basic 
sciences such as chemistry and physics, culinary arts, agronomics and 
microbiology. It is a broad discipline concerned with all the technical 
aspects of food, beginning with harvesting or slaughtering and ending 
with cooking and consumption. Food Scientists have to use the knowledge 
of biology, physical sciences and engineering to study the composition 
of foods, changes that occur at various stages from harvest through 
different processes and storage, causes of their spoilage and the principles 
underlying food processing. Food scientists deal with physico-chemical 
aspects of food, thus helping us to understand the nature and properties 
of food.

Food Processing: It is the set of methods and techniques used to transform 
raw ingredients into finished and semi-finished products. Food processing 
requires good quality raw materials from either plant and/or animal 
source to be converted into attractive, marketable and often long shelf-life 
food products. 

Food Technology: Technology is the science and application of scientific, 
as well as socio-economic knowledge and legal rules for production. 
Food technology uses and exploits knowledge of Food Science and Food 
Engineering to produce varied foods. Study of Food Technology gives 
in-depth knowledge of science and technology, and develops skills for 
selection, storage, preservation, processing, packaging, distribution of safe, 
nutritious, wholesome, desirable as well as affordable, convenient foods. 

Another significant aspect of food technology is to promote sustainability 
to avoid waste and save and utilise all the food produced and ensure safe 
and sustainable processing practices.

Food manufacturing: It is the mass production of food products using 
principles of food technology to meet the diverse needs of the growing 
population. Food manufacturing is one of the largest manufacturing 
industries in the present times.

Development of Food Processing and Technology 

Research in the field of Food Technology has been conducted for decades.  In 
1810, development of the canning process by Nicolas Appert was a decisive 
event. Canning had a major impact on food preservation techniques. Later 
Louis Pasteur’s research, in 1864, on spoilage of wine and his description 
of how to avoid spoilage was an early attempt to put food technology on 
a scientific basis. Besides wine spoilage, Pasteur conducted research 
on production of alcohol, vinegar, wines, beer and souring of milk. He 
developed ‘pasteurisation’- the process of treating milk to destroy disease 
producing organisms. Pasteurisation was a significant advance in ensuring 
microbiological safety of food. 

Food Technology was initially used to serve military needs. In the 20th 
century, world wars, exploration of space and the rising demand for varied 
products from consumers contributed to the growth of Food Technology. 
Products such as instant soup mixes and ready-to-cook items including 
meals were developed, specially catering to needs of working women. 
Further, food industry was compelled to focus on nutritional concerns. 
Food preferences and choices changed and people started incorporating 
into their diet food items/preparations from different regions and 
countries. The desire to have seasonal foods all year round increased. Food 
technologists made efforts to provide both safer and fresher food using 
new techniques. In the 21st century, food technologists are challenged to 
produce foods suitable for health and other changing needs of consumers. 
Food technology has provided a vast variety of safe and convenient foods. 

64 In developing countries this rapidly expanding and developing field, has

been helpful in improving food security and has opened avenues for 
employment at all levels.

Importance of Food Processing and Preservation                           

It has already been mentioned that food processing is a branch of 
manufacturing wherein raw materials are  transformed into intermediate 
foodstuffs or edible products through the application of scientific knowledge 
and technology. Various processes are used to convert bulky, perishable 
and sometimes inedible food materials into more useful, concentrated, 
shelf-stable and palatable foods or potable beverages. Changes in the 
products often reduce preparation time for the cook. Most of the time, 
processing of foods adds value to the resultant product by increasing 
storability, portability, palatability and convenience. Professionals in the 
food processing need to be knowledgeable about general characteristics 
of raw food materials, principles of food preservation, processing factors 
which influence quality, packaging, water and waste management, good 
manufacturing processes and sanitation procedures. Let us briefly examine 
the need, principles, methods and modernisation of food processing. 

Foods are subject to physical, chemical and biological deterioration. 
Food deterioration is associated with spoilage, development of off-flavors, 
deterioration of textures, discoloration and loss of nutritional value in 
varying degrees, reducing aesthetic appeal and rendering it unfit/unsafe 
for consumption. A number of factors can lead to food deterioration or 
spoilage e.g. pests, infestation by insects, inappropriate temperatures 
used for processing and/or storage, excessive exposure to light and 
other radiations, oxygen, moisture. Food is also contaminated by micro 
organisms [bacteria, fungus and moulds) or chemicals such as pesticides. 
Food can also be spoiled due to degradation by naturally present enzymes 
(a specific class of protein molecules that act as biological catalysts to 
accelerate chemical reactions). In addition, physical and chemical changes 
in certain constituents of food from plant and animal sources occur soon 
after harvesting or slaughtering, altering the food quality.

Therefore food processing and preservation are required to preserve 
food in edible and safe form. Methods by which food is preserved from 
spoiling after harvesting or slaughtering date back to prehistoric times. The 
oldest methods were sun drying, controlled fermentation, salting/pickling, 
candying, roasting, smoking, baking and using spices as preservatives. 
These tried and tested techniques are still used although, with the advent of 
industrial revolution, new methods have been developed. Food processing 
incorporates and unifies the general characteristics of different classes 
of foods and  principles of food science, chemistry, food microbiology,

nutrition, sensory analysis and statistics including good manufacturing 
practices as per regulations.                                              

Classes of Foods Based on Perishability
Perishable foods are foods that spoil quickly within one or two days 
e.g., milk, curds, fish and meat.
Semi perishable foods can last for 1 – 2 weeks. Examples are fruits 
and vegetables. Root crops like onions and potatoes last for 2 – 4 
weeks.

Non-perishable are those foods that generally last for one year e.g., 
grains like rice, wheat, pulses and dals, oilseeds.

Many food processing operations are designed to extend the shelf life 
of the food products. The concepts associated with food processing are 
reducing/eliminating microbial activity and other factors that influence 
food spoilage. The principle micro organisms that cause food spoilage 
are bacteria, fungi, yeasts and moulds. Just recollect that you studied in 
biology how they grow typically very rapidly under congenial conditions. 
Factors influencing microbial growth are nutrient availability, moisture, 
pH, oxygen levels and the presence or absence of inhibiting substances e.g. 
antibiotics. The activity of enzymes inherently present in foods also depends 
on pH and temperature. Oxidative enzymes in fresh fruits and vegetables 
continue to use oxygen to metabolise, reducing the shelf life of fruits and 
vegetables. So the basic concepts 
in food processing methods to 
prevent food spoilage are: Did You Know?

Processed foods can be classified on the basis of extent and type of 
processing as follows:

1. Minimally processed foods: These are processed as little as 
possible in order to retain the quality of fresh foods. Generally the 
processes used are cleaning, trimming, shelling, cutting, slicing 
and storage at low i.e., refrigeration temperatures.

2. Preserved foods: The methods of preservation used do not change 
the character of the product substantially e.g., frozen peas and 
frozen vegetables, dehydrated peas, dehydrated vegetables, 
canned fruits and vegetables.

3. Manufactured foods: In such products, the original characteristics 
of the raw products are lost and some basic methods of preservation 
are used, often using various ingredients such as salt, sugar, 
oil or even chemical preservatives. Examples are pickles, jams, 
marmalades, squashes, papads, wadis.

4. Formulated foods: These are products prepared by mixing and 
processing of individual ingredients to result in relatively shelf-
stable food products such as bread, biscuits, ice cream, cakes, 
kulfi. 

5. Food derivatives: In industry, components of foods may be 
obtained from the raw product through purification, e.g., sugar 
from sugarcane or oil from oil seeds. In some cases, the derivative 
or the component may be processed further, e.g., conversion of oil 
to vanaspati (the process is called hydrogenation).

6. Functional foods: These are foods that can have a beneficial effect 
on human health, e.g., probiotics.

7. Medical foods: These are used in dietary management of diseases, 
for example, low sodium salt, lactose–free milk for persons with 
lactose intolerance.

With globalisation, Indian shores have opened up to foreign investments 
and technologies. As a result, many foreign companies and multinational 
companies are setting up their production, R&D, educational and 
outsourcing facilities in our country. Thus there is ample scope for food 
technologists/scientists in Indian as well as foreign organisations. Also, 
food processing industry provides good opportunity for export of products. 
Employment exchanges will also be strengthened and upgraded. 

 Self Employment Avenues: Food processing in India has always been 
practised as household or cottage scale activity. Despite lack of basic 
training in food processing operations, sweets, papads, murrabas, pickles, 
fried snacks, roasted and puffed cereals were prepared and marketed 
for local consumption. Now with the growth in agriculture, horticulture 
and pisiculture, the production of raw material has improved. Also the 
Government is giving incentives and support for enterpreneurs who 
want to start their own enterprise by way of providing finances, training, 
infrastructure and marketing facilities. Financial support is provided 
by many banks, with encouragement for women entrepreneurs. State 
Governments also contribute by providing space to those desirous of 
obtaining the same. A self employment venture in food technology may be 
highly technology-oriented and investment–intensive, or it can be a very 
low key technology and low investment unit, e.g., salted peanuts, drinking 
water pouches, dehydrated products, pickles, among others. 

The Indian food industry with a size of 61 billion US dollars, ranks 
5th in terms of size, contributes nearly 6 per cent of GDP, 13 per cent of 
Indian exports and involves 6 per cent of total industrial investment in the 
country. Besides, it is estimated to grow at the rate of 20 per cent of which 
processed food segment accounts for 25 per cent. Key segments of this 
industry are milk and milk products, snack foods, bakery products, fruit 
and vegetable products, beverages (alcoholic and non alcoholic), fish and 
meat processing, food processing machines and allied equipment.  Exports 
are rising and this boosts employment avenues.

Food Quality and 

Food Safety

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter the learner will be able to:

�	 explain the importance of various issues related to food safety and 
quality

�	 understand how food-borne illnesses occur

�	 know about national and international food standards and their role 
in ensuring food quality and safety

�	 understand the importance of food safety management systems

�	 be acquainted with various career avenues / options in this area.

Introduction

Food is a major determinant of health, nutritional status and productivity 
of the population.  It is, therefore, essential that the food we consume 
is wholesome and safe. Unsafe food can lead to a large number of food-
borne diseases. You may have seen reports in the newspapers about 
health problems caused by contaminated or adulterated foods. Globally, 
food-borne illness is a major problem of public health concern. In 
India, the National Family Health Survey, 2015 – 2016 stated 

Reprint 2025-26



that more than 9 lakh children less than five years of age suffered from 
acute diarrhea. Food-borne illness can not only result in mortality but can 
damage trade and tourism, lead to loss of earnings, unemployment and 
litigation and thus can impede economic growth, and therefore food safety 
and quality have gained worldwide significance.  

Significance

Food safety and quality are important at the home level, but are critical in 
large scale food production and processing, and also where food is freshly 
prepared and served. In the past, many foods were processed at home. 
Advancement in technology and processing, higher per capita incomes 
and better purchasing power as well as increased consumer demand have 
led to a variety of processed foods, food for health / functional foods being 
manufactured.  Safety of such foods needs to be assessed.

The quality of food stuff, raw as well as processed is of public health 
concern and must be addressed. In the past decade, safety challenges 
faced globally as well as in India have changed significantly and issues 
related to food quality and food safety have gained tremendous importance. 
A number of factors are responsible for this:

�	 With fast changing lifestyles and eating habits, more people are eating 
outside their homes. In commercial settings, foods are prepared in 
bulk handled by many persons, thus there are more chances of food 
getting contaminated. Further, food items are prepared many hours 
in advance, and may spoil if not stored appropriately. 

�	 There are many processed and packaged foods.  Safety of these foods 
is important.

�	 Spices and condiments, oilseeds were processed at home in former 
times and purity of these were not a concern. In today’s world, pre-
packaged individual spices, condiments, spice powders and mixes 
are in demand, especially in cities and metros. Quality of even raw 
food stuff besides processed foods is of public health concern and 
must be addressed.

�	 Logistics governing transport of bulk food is complex and there is a long 
gap between processing and consumption. Thus risk assessment and 
safety management during mass production and mass distribution is 
critical.  

�	 Microbial adaptations, antibiotic resistance, altered human 
susceptibility and international traveling have all contributed to 
increasing incidence of food-borne microbial diseases. Nearly half of 

76

all known food-borne pathogens have been discovered during the past 
25-30 years. There are still many food borne illnesses of unknown 
etiology. This is an issue of global public health concern and there 
is a need to detect, identify and recognise emerging pathogens and 
establish active surveillance networks, nationally and internationally. 

�	 India is a signatory to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) non-tariff 
agreement, which has provided greater access to world markets and 
opportunities to all countries to enter international trade.   In this 
scenario, it has become essential for every country to protect the 
safety and quality of foods and also ensure that imported foods are 
of good quality and safe to eat.  Effective food standards and control 
systems are required to protect food production within the country as 
well as to facilitate trade with other nations. All food manufacturers 
are required to meet the given standards of quality and safety, and 
need to have their products regularly tested. 

�	 Pollution in atmosphere, soil and water, including use of pesticides in 
agriculture, bring their share of contaminants. Also use of additives 
such as preservatives, colourants, flavouring agents and other 
substances such as stabilisers makes the analysis of food for various 
components — both nutrients and contaminants—imperative.

Owing to the above factors, there is a growing concern for safe, 
wholesome and nutritious foods in a highly dynamic food business 
environment, which in turn has greatly expanded the scope and has 
increased career opportunities in this sector.  Before learning about the 
various career options in this field, it will be worthwhile for us to understand 
the basic concepts regarding food quality, food safety, risk assessment, 
food standards and quality management systems.

Basic Concepts

Food Safety

Food safety means assurance that food is acceptable for human 
consumption according to its intended use. An understanding of food 
safety is improved by defining two other concepts — toxicity and hazard.

Toxicity is the capacity of a substance to produce harm or injury of any 
kind under any conditions. Hazard is the relative probability that harm 
or injury will result when substance is not used in a prescribed manner 
and quantity. Hazards can be physical, chemical and biological causing 
harmful / adverse effects on the health of consumers.

Physical hazard is any physical material not normally found in food, 
which causes illness or injury and includes wood, stones, parts of pests, 
hair etc. (Fig. 6.1).

Chemical hazards are chemicals or deleterious substances which may 
be intentionally or un-intentionally added to foods.  This category of hazards 
includes pesticides, chemical residues, toxic metals, polychlorinated 
biphenyls, preservatives, food colours and other additives (Fig. 6.2).

Biological hazards are living organisms and include microbiological 
organisms (Fig. 6.3 and 6.4). Those micro-organisms which are associated 
with food and cause diseases are termed food-borne pathogens. There are 
two types of food-borne diseases from microbial pathogens—infections 
and poisoning.

Food infection /Food Poisoning results from ingestion of live pathogenic 
organisms which multiply in the body and cause disease. Salmonella is a 
classic example. This organism exists in the intestinal tract of animals. 
Raw milk and eggs are also sources. Heat destroys Salmonella, however, 
inadequate cooking allows some organisms to survive. Often Salmonella 
is spread through cross-contamination. This could happen when a cook 
cuts raw meat/poultry on a chopping board and without cleaning uses it 
for another food which does not involve any cooking, such as salad. Food 
may become infected by Salmonella if an infected food handler does not 
wash hands with soap after using bathroom and before touching food. 
Salmonella can reproduce very quickly and double their number every 
20 minutes. The symptoms of Salmonella infection include diarrhea, fever 
and abdominal cramps.

Food intoxication: Some bacteria produce harmful toxins which are 
present in food even if pathogen has been killed. Organisms produce 
toxins when the food has not been hot enough or cold enough. Toxins in 
food cannot be detected by smell, appearance or taste. Hence foods which 
smell and appear good are not necessarily safe. One example of such an 
organism is Staphylococcus aureus. Such organisms exist in air, dust, 
water. They are also present in the nasal passage, throat and on skin, 
hair of 50 per cent of healthy individuals. People who carry this organism, 
contaminate food if they touch these places on body while food handling. 
Diarrhea is also one of the symptoms of this contamination.

Parasites can also cause infestation, e.g., worm infestation by tape worm 
in pork. In addition to this, food can be infested by pests and insects 
(Fig. 6.5).

 

Fig. 6.5: Infestation of foods

Among the various hazards, biological hazards are an important 
cause of food-borne illnesses. In spite of all the efforts in the area of food 
safety, microbial food-borne pathogens are still a serious concern and new 

81
pathogens continue to emerge.   

Reprint 2025-26

Unit II - Nutrition, Food Science 
And Technology



Factors that are important in the emergence of pathogens include 
human host, animal hosts and their interactions with humans, the 
pathogen itself, and the environment including how food is produced, 
processed, handled and stored. For example, changes in host 
susceptibility due to malnutrition, age and other conditions can allow 
for the emergence of new infections in vulnerable populations. Genetic 
exchange or mutations in the organisms can create new strains with the 
potential to cause disease. Exposure to new pathogens through changes 
in eating habits, climate, mass production, food processing and increased 
globalisation of the food supply can allow pathogens to emerge in new 
populations or new geographic areas.

Examples are Norovirus, Rotavirus, hepatitis E contributing to about 
70 per cent of cases. New pathogens will continue to evolve and there is 
a need to develop methods to isolate them, control them and detect their 
presence in foods.

In the context of food safety, it is important to understand the terms 
contamination and adulteration.

Contamination: It is the presence of harmful, or objectionable 
foreign substances in food such as chemicals, micro-organisms, 
dilutants before/during or after processing or storage.

Adulteration: Food adulteration is the process in which the 
quality of food is lowered either by the addition of inferior quality 
material or by extraction of valuable ingredient. It not only 
includes the intentional addition or substitution of the substances 
but biological and chemical contamination during the period of 
growth, storage, processing, transport and distribution of the food 
products. It is also responsible for lowering or degradation of the 
quality of food products. 

Adulterants: are those substances which are used for making the 
food products unsafe for human consumption.

Having understood what food safety is, let us discuss food quality.

Food Quality: The term food quality refers to attributes that influence 
a product’s value to consumers. This includes both negative attributes 
such as spoilage, contamination, adulteration, food safety hazards as well 
as positive attributes such as colour, flavour, texture.  It is therefore a 
holistic concept integrating factors such as nutritional traits, sensorial 
properties (colour, texture, shape, appearance, taste, flavour, odour), social 
considerations, safety. Safety is a preliminary attribute and precursor of 
quality. In order to ensure that foods are safe and of good quality, across 
the world various governments and international bodies have laid down 

82
food standards that manufacturers/suppliers are expected to adhere to.

Thus, all food service providers (those involved at all stages of 
pre-preparation and preparation/processing, packaging and service) 
should adhere to good manufacturing practices and ensure food safety. 
Salient points to be borne in mind are:

1. Quality of raw materials and water

2. Cleanliness — of the premises, personnel, equipment, food preparation 
and storage and serving areas

3. Storage of food at appropriate temperature

4. Food hygiene

5. Good service practices.

Food Standards

Effective food standards and control systems are required to integrate quality 
into every aspect of food production and service, to ensure the supply of 
hygienic, wholesome food as well as to facilitate trade within and between 
nations. There are four levels of standards which are well coordinated.

a. Company Standards: These are prepared by a Company for its own 
use. Normally, they are copies of National Standards. 

b. National Standards: These are issued by the national standards body, 83

International Organisations and Agreements in the Area of Food 
Standards, Quality, Research and Trade 

Since ancient times, governing authorities the world over, have made 
attempts to develop and implement food standards in order to protect health 
of consumers and prevent dishonest practices in sale of food. There have 
been several international organisations and agreements which have played 

in a scientific manner, which were not specified in the PFA. The FSSA

food and agricultural trade.  In 2017, the membership of Codex was 187 
member countries and one Member Organisation (European Community) 
respectively. India is a member through the Ministry of Health and Family 
Welfare. CAC has become the single most important international reference 
point for developments associated with food standards. The document 
published by the CAC is Codex Alimentarius which means ‘Food Code’ and is a 
collection of  internationally adopted Food Standards. The document includes 
Standards, Codes of Practice, Guidelines and other recommendations in 
order to protect consumers and ensure fair practices in food trade.  Different 
countries use Codex Standards to develop national standards.

The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act 1954 (PFA, 1954) was 
enacted by the Government of India to prevent adulteration of food. 
The Act has been amended over 200 times as per need. In addition 
to PFA, there are other Orders or Acts that help to ensure the quality 
of specific foods such as:
• Fruit and Vegetable Product Order: Specifications for fruit and 

vegetable products are laid down.

• Meat Food Products Order: Processing of meat products is 
licensed under this order.

• Vegetable Oil Products Order: Specifications for vanaspati, 
margarine and shortenings are laid down.

All such acts have been consolidated under the Food Safety and 
Standards Act.

All food products manufactured in India, or imported and sold in India 
have to meet the requirements prescribed under the Food Safety and 
Standards Act.

2. International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)

The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) is a worldwide, 
non-governmental federation of national standards bodies (ISO member 
bodies).  The mission of ISO is to promote the development of standardisation 
and related activities in the world with a view to facilitate the international 
exchange of goods and services, and to develop cooperation in the spheres 
of intellectual, scientific, technological and economic activity.  The work 
done by ISO results in international agreements which are published as 
International Standards.

ISO 9000 is an international reference for quality requirements. It is 
concerned with “Quality Management” of an organisation. Adoption of 
these standards is voluntary. The difference between Codex and ISO are 

86 given in the box given hereby.

3. World Trade Organisation (WTO)

WTO was established in 1995. The main objective of WTO is to help trade flow 
smoothly, freely, fairly and predictably, by administering trade agreements, 
settling trade disputes, assisting countries in trade policy issues. The WTO 
Agreement covers goods, services and intellectual property.

In order to enforce adoption and implementation of standards, there is 
a need for a strong Food Control System.  An effective food control system 
must consist of — (i) Food Inspection and (ii) Analytical capability.

Food Inspection: Conformity of products to standards is verified through 
inspection. This will ensure that all foods are produced, handled, processed, 
stored and distributed in compliance with regulations and legislation. 
Government / Municipal authorities appoint food inspectors to investigate 
the status of quality conformity to standards in their laboratories.

Analytical capability: There is need for well-equipped, state-of-the-art 
accredited laboratories to carry out analysis of food. Further, well- trained 
personnel having knowledge of principles of laboratory management and 
physical, chemical and microbiological analysis of food, test foods and 
food products are also required. A broad range of analytical capabilities 
is required for detecting food contaminants, environmental chemicals, 
biotoxins, pathogenic bacteria, food-borne viruses and parasites.

Food Safety Management Systems

Over the years, issues related to food safety and quality have gone beyond 
just the avoidance of food-borne pathogens, chemical toxicants and other 
hazards. A food hazard can enter/come into the food at any stage of the 
food chain, therefore, adequate control through out the food chain is 87
essential.  Food safety and quality can be ensured through:

�		Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)
�	 Good Handling Practices (GHP)
�	 Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP)
Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) are a part of quality assurance to 
ensure that manufacturers/processors take proactive steps to ensure that 
their products are safe. It enables to minimise or eliminate contamination 
and false labelling, thereby protecting the consumer from being misled 
and helping in purchasing products that are not harmful. GMP is a good 
business tool that helps to refine compliance and performance by the 
manufacturers/producers.

Good Handling Practices indicate a comprehensive approach from the farm 
to the store or consumer, in order to identify potential sources of risk 
and indicates what steps and procedures are taken to minimise the risk 
of contamination. It ensures that all persons who handle food have good 
hygiene practices.

Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP)

HACCP is a means of providing assurance about safety of food. HACCP 
is an approach to food manufacture and storage in which raw materials 
and each individual step in a specific process are considered in detail and 
evaluated for its potential to contribute to the development of pathogenic 
micro organisms or other food hazards. It involves identification of hazards, 
assessment of chances of occurrence of hazards during each step /stage in 
the food chain — raw material procurement, manufacturing, distribution, 
usage of food products and defining measures for hazard(s) control.

Why implement HACCP?
Activity 2

Visit a nearby restaurant / canteen / dhaba / street food vending 
outlet and observe the following:

�	 The area where food is prepared and served

�	 How the food is prepared and stored

�	 How the food is served

�	 The food service area

�	 Washing area

�	 The area surrounding the unit

�	 All persons involved in handling the food from pre-preparation

�	 It is a preventive approach to ensure food safety.

�	 End product inspection and testing, although important, is time 
consuming, expensive and detects the problems only after they 
occur. In contrast, HACCP enables us to detect hazards at any stage 
of processing or manufacture in order to ensure a good quality end 
product, by taking appropriate action at the stage where the problem 
occurs. 

�	 It enables producers, processors, distributors and exporters to utilise 
resources efficiently and in a cost effective manner for assuring food 
safety.

�	 FSSA, 2006 places primary responsibility for safe food with producers 
and suppliers through HACCP, GMP, GHP.  This is important for 
consumer protection and international food trade.

�	 It assures consistently good quality products.

Scope

India is experiencing growth in the area of food processing. The food 
industry in India accounts for about 26 per cent of the gross domestic 
product (GDP) and will be one of the major growth areas in the years ahead. 
This has given impetus to international trade but has also increased the 
responsibility to achieve appropriate level of safety in terms of sanitary and 
phyto-sanitary protection.  Further, the Indian Food Safety and Standards 
Act of 2006, reflects a major shift in food laws and seeks to provide greater 
consumer protection by ensuring safety and wholesomeness of food at all 
stages of the food chain. This changing scenario has widened the scope 
and increased career options/opportunities in this area.

Professionals who take up careers in this area need to have adequate 
knowledge and expertise in Food Chemistry, Food Processing and 
Preservation, Food Analysis and Quality Control. It is also desirable to 
be well versed in Food Microbiology, Food Laws and Sensory Evaluation. 
Professionals may be employed with regulatory and public health agencies 
as food legislators, food safety officers (inspectors), food analysts/public 
analysts. Professionals can also work in voluntary agencies such as 
Agmark, BIS, as well as in the Quality Control Laboratories. One can work 
as food auditor after undergoing required training. Further, large food 
industries, flight kitchens, etc. have in-house quality control units which 
require trained professionals. In a Food Industry, numerous opportunities 
are available as shown in Fig. 6.6.

Unit I - Work, Livelihood and Career



Introduction

In Class XI, you have read about the importance of studying development 
of a person from a young age onwards. There are many changes that 
take place in a person as he or she grows up. Students, who choose to 
specialise in Human Development and Family Studies (HDFS) study these 
changes and also learn the ways in which they can provide effective and 
meaningful services for people at different ages, with different needs and 
under different circumstances. In the forthcoming chapters, we will explore 
the different options for careers in this domain. We all know that studying 
HEFS helps us to know ourselves and the people around us better and to 
lead a more meaningful life, well integrated in our cultural tradition, with 
the knowledge of the developing world, science, technology and progress. 
The home and workplace are treated with equal respect and the personal, 
family life of any individual is given full consideration in understanding 
the person.

In accordance with the National Curriculum Framework (2005), all 
ethnic groups, languages, religions and communities are regarded as 
equal. In the forthcoming chapters, we will explore the careers that are 
available to students who wish to work in this field. 

At the college level, the discipline of HDFS is referred to by different 
names in different institutions as Child Development, Human Development 
and Childhood Studies, and Human Ecology. While the core of the discipline 
remains the same, there may be slight differences in their perspectives. For 
example, when the discipline is referred to as Child Development, there 
may be a greater focus on childhood and less emphasis on the life span 
development. However, these differences are only a matter of degree and 
the substantive component of the discipline remains essentially similar. 

A career in HDFS is especially suitable for those who feel drawn towards 
understanding interpersonal relationships and find it comfortable to talk 
about these issues. A fair degree of honest self-reflection is usually a part 
and parcel of the career in HDFS – this can be exciting as you learn more 
about yourself and others around you. 

While the HDFS discipline helps you to develop the abilities to work 
with individuals and groups across the life span, from the very young to 
the old, you will find that the organisations and the programmes in the field 
focus on specific dimensions. Some may work with children in the early 
childhood years to create conditions for their all round development; some 
may be involved in providing counselling services to specific age groups; and 
some may strive to design interventions in the sector of education. In fact, 
further in the chapter, we have identified the major areas of work within 

100 the domain of HDFS and presented the information accordingly as follows:

Early Childhood Care 
and Education

Learning Objectives
After completing this section the learner will be able to:

zz understand the basic principles of Early Childhood Care and Education 
(ECCE) as they apply to Indian society

zz understand the importance of early care and learning experiences for 
children

zz understand how children play and learn

zz explain the knowledge and skills required for a career in ECCE

Significance

Early childhood care and education is a very important area of study in 
Human Development. We have learnt in Class XI, how the infant begins 
to learn from a very early age. In addition to learning new things about 
the world around him or her, the infant is developing an attachment with 
family members, particularly with the mother and father, as well as with 
siblings, and grandparents. The young child also begins to recognise 
other family members and people whom he or she meets regularly. This 
way, the child will also be able to distinguish between people who he/she 
recognises and those who look unfamiliar. This recognition is manifested 
in the behaviour where a young baby of around 8–12 months can show 

Reprint 2025-26



fear of unknown people. This fear is not simply an emotional display, it 
shows a capacity to recognise familiar faces and thereby indicates a fear 
of unfamiliar people. Further, the child is deeply attached to the mother 
who is generally, but not always, the primary caregiver and can also start 
to cry when she leaves the room. The young child of around one year will 
try to cling to the mother or other caregiver and follow her everywhere. In 
most cases, this behaviour is soon discarded because the child develops 
the ability to know that the mother does not ‘vanish’ when she goes into 
another room. The child develops a sense of security even about the 
primary caregiver’s absence. Further, the child is growing very rapidly, 
learning to walk, pick up things with precision, and manage his or her 
body in many ways. The child is also developing control over bladder and 
bowel movements. 

In most cases, children are brought up exclusively within a family for 
the first few years. In some instances, where the mother is working outside 
the home, there may be a need for substitute provisions for the care of the 
child. Traditionally, the care of the child was usually the responsibility of 
another female of the household who lived with the family permanently 
(as in joint families) or temporarily resided with the family for support in 
child care. In recent times, however, there has been an increasing need 
for the provision of institutional child care. This can take the form of 
informal family care settings, where a woman in a neighbourhood sets up 
a ‘crèche’ in her home for business purposes or an institutionalised centre 
where children are cared for. The crèche or family care is primarily seen 
as substitute for the mother/primary caregiver. However, these may not 
be seen as an essential experience for the enrichment of a child’s learning 
and development. 

Activity 1

From your memory of last year’s course, list some of the things that 
you think a child should know how to do or be capable of performing 
before entering Class1. For example, can a child walk, talk, read full 
sentences? 

(Teacher should discuss these and then add/delete from to the list.) 

Ideally, once the child is around three years of age, the activities and 
experiences begin to expand. However, experts differ on the exact age 
until which a child should be kept at home, before entry to formal school. 
Although the child is still capable of enjoying only informal and small 

103
group activities, there is an increasing value for opportunities to engage 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit III - Human Development And 

Family Studies



with people outside the family and close community. These early years 
are extremely important for a child to learn new things, explore the 
environment and discover the world around. Once the children learn 
to walk and run, manipulate things and speak, they become capable of 
actively engaging with the environment. It is in interaction with people and 
materials around them that children at this age gather all the information. 
Vocabulary in the mother tongue is growing rapidly at this time, as is the 
child’s understanding of nature like sand, water, flowers, birds, machines 
and other materials. They are curious to learn more and are often heard 
asking adults when they see something, “Why is this so?”. Thus satisfying 
a child’s curiosity by providing an optimal learning environment without 
overburdening the child to do more than what s/he is capable of is an 
essential consideration at this age. If we force a child to sit in one place 
and learn like in a formal school meant for older children, the curiosity 
will diminish, and a child will feel anxious and insecure. It is thus very 
important to understand that the best learning environment for a child at 
this age is one that is safe, secure, loving, with a variety of people and play 
materials (toys or natural), and the presence of a caring adult, whether it 
is the mother, grandparent, or a preschool teacher, or a sibling. 

The learning and other experiences provided by a good preschool 
have been found to be extremely beneficial for young children at this 
age. The child centred approach and the play way method which makes 
learning enjoyable is ideally suited for young children. Children enjoy the 
company of other children and learn very quickly to do things that often 
surprise even the parents. One such observation that often takes place 
in preschool settings is the sheer wonder that parents of young children 
express when their child has been known to eat by himself or herself, 
and also eats things that he/she may not have eaten at home. Children 
learn very quickly among peers and for these and other reasons, preschool 
experiences become important at this age. Also, for children who live in 
difficult circumstances or who may need additional support for learning, a 
good preschool environment is known to be very beneficial. 

Does that mean that children who do not go to nursery school are 
not learning? Absolutely not! All children learn, naturally. Preschool 
experiences help to enhance the child’s exposure to other adults and 
other environments and materials; and more importantly, to prepare the 
young child for formal schooling. Preschool education in a programme 
which is child-centred and informal, provides the child with a good 
learning environment that complements the advantages of a good learning 
environment at home. Also, if in situations where the home environment 
may be lacking in some way or the other, the preschool experience can 
be an important factor in assisting the child’s growth and development 

104 outside the home.

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



In several communities, especially those living in remote areas or those 
with fewer resources at their disposal, older children who are of school-
going age are often given the responsibility for the care of younger ones, 
as parents go out for work. Consequently, the older child is unable to 
participate in schooling. Therefore institutional care for young children is 
beneficial for the older child as well since he/she is released from the task of 
child care and can attend school. Thus, children, both young and of school 
age, can be helped to have access to services when they live in difficult 
circumstances. Further these services also provide for interventions in 
nutrition, health, besides learning as and when there is a requirement. 
Thus, there is a support to society in the task of developing and building 
the next generation for the future. Early childhood care and education and 
care is an activity that benefits childhood in different circumstances, as 
well as families by providing the support to parents and the community in 
these basic tasks.

As per the NCF (2005) Position Paper on Early Childhood Education 
published by NCERT, the basic objectives of ECCE are:
zz Holistic development of the child to enable him/her to realise the 

potential

zz Preparation for school

zz Providing support services for women and children

Basic concepts

There are some important concepts associated with early childhood care 
and education that we must understand before proceeding further. Early 
childhood is the phase of life from birth till 8 years of age, and is commonly 
divided into two, from birth to three years and 3–8 years, based on the 
developmental changes that characterise young children in these two 
stages. Infancy is the period between birth and one year (some experts also 
denote infancy till two years), during which a child is largely dependent 
upon adults for everyday needs. This period is of intense dependence on 
adults, usually the mother or father, or any other primary caregiver who 
maybe the grandmother or helper. In circumstances where the mother is 
employed outside the home, the infant has to be cared for by a substitute 
caregiver, who may be a family member or a hired person. The location of 
the substitute care arrangement may be the child’s own home or the home 
of the caregiver or an institution or crèche. Crèche is the name given to an 
institutional setting that is particularly designed for the care of infants and 
young children in the absence of home care. Day care, on the other hand, 
is the care of children in the preschool years and may include infants 

105

and preschoolers, who are cared for, again in the absence of a primary 
caregiver at home. 

Day care and crèches are usually all-day programmes. Teachers and 
helpers in these programmes need to be especially trained for the care 
of very young children, their safety, their feeding, toilet habits, language 
development, social and emotional needs and learning. Teachers, who 
have to deal with children above three years of age, require different 
skill sets. The child between two and three is sometimes referred to as 
a toddler, a term that is derived from the jumpy walk that a young child 
has at this age. A preschool child is so called because he or she is now 
ready for experiencing some sort of environment beyond that of the family 
(extra-familial). Even for this programme, a teacher needs to be specially 
trained as a pre-school or nursery school teacher. Some pre-schools for 
young children are often called Montessori schools. These are schools 
based on the principles of early childhood education as outlined by a 
well-known educationist Maria Montessori. It is worth mentioning that 
the Government of India has addressed the needs of this age grouping by 
offering pre-school education through the anganwadis that operate under 
its Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS). There are angawadis in 
urban and rural areas.

Some of the other concepts related to this field that we need to know, 
deal with understanding the fact that children at this age have a very 
different approach to understanding the things that happen around 
them. The developmental psychologist Jean Piaget spent his life trying 
to comprehend and explain that young children have different ways of 
understanding the world, due to which, they need a supportive environment 
to explore phenomena in their own ways. You have studied these features 
of children’s development last year in Class XI. It is important to keep 
those details in mind in order to understand the principles of care and 
education of young children.

Another important principle to be kept in mind is the fact that any 
ECCE institution must realise the importance of the cultural context 
within which it operates and works along with, rather than in opposition 
to, the family. Although this is true for all ages, it becomes more significant 
for the young child since he or she is unable to make distinctions about 
different perspectives and different realities in the ways that an older child 
or adult can. Thus we have to understand that the educational and care 
arrangements for children must follow these principles. 

106

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



As per the NCF (2005) on ECCE, the guiding principles of ECCE are:

zz Play as the basis for learning

zz Art as the basis of education

zz Recognition of the special features of children’s thinking

zz Primacy of experience rather than expertise (i.e., experiential learning 
is emphasised)

zz Experience of familiarity and challenge in everyday routines

zz Mix of formal and informal interactions

zz Blend of textual and cultural sources

zz Use of local materials, arts and knowledge

zz Developmentally appropriate practices, flexibility and plurality
zz Health, well-being and healthy habits. 

Activity 2

From your childhood, recall and write down any story that you heard 
and that you enjoyed a lot. Also mention who used to tell you the 
story and what you liked about the story. Mention which character 
you liked the best in the story and why. 

The teacher should choose some stories for presentation to the 
class so that the students can learn from each other and share 
the enjoyment of collective memories and interaction.  Also it gives 
students an opportunity to gain an understanding of other families, 
cultures and communities.

Preparing for A Career

It has been mentioned earlier that since children under 6 years of age have 
particular ways of understanding the world and social relationships, have 
specific developmental needs, any adult attempting to work with children 
must be carefully and well trained in the field of early child development 
and care. We might think here that when young women and men become 
parents, they are not required to have any training in child care, why 
should a teacher or a caregiver require any training? 

There are several reasons why even parents would also benefit from 
knowing more about how and why children do the things that they do. 
Parents would also benefit very much from knowing more about expected 
differences between children of the same age and also appreciate that there 
are individual differences. They should realise that there is often no point 
in competitive comparisons between children and even between siblings. 
Thus we must understand that ALL adults in contact with children WILL, 
certainly benefit from a scientific understanding of development and 
growth leading to realistic expectations and interactions with children. 

Training and scientific knowledge of childhood, and developmental 
changes and challenges is even more critical for those adults who choose 
early childhood programmes as a career. Early child care professionals are 
responsible for children other than their own. The activities they perform 
as child care professionals constitute their work and they receive formal 
recognition for this. Teachers and caregivers are responsible to children 
who may not be their biological offspring, to the large group of adults who 
are family members of the children under their supervision and to the 

108

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



institution they work for, as well as the larger society. ECCE professionals 
have to be committed to the children, their well-being and learning, be 
aware and knowledgeable about their needs and the challenges for 
providing opportunities for their growth and development.

What is the expectation from an adult teacher/caregiver of young 
children? During preschool years, a teacher needs to keep all the above 
points in mind, but there is less of a requirement for supervision of physical 
care of preschool children, like cleaning, feeding, toilet activity since the 
child develops the capability to speak, to control his or her bowel and 
bladder movements, eat independently. A teacher needs to focus more on 
providing interesting and stimulating  opportunities for children to learn 
new things, experience natural phenomena, provide ample opportunities 
for a variety of experiences like physical, language, social-emotional and 
other learning experiences. The focus is on enhancing creative expression 
and exploration, although these aspects are equally important in the 
earlier years too. 

It is necessary to focus on providing opportunities to young children 
primarily because they have a greater requirement for adult guidance. If 
we want to express ourselves creatively as adults, we are quite capable of 
arranging the necessary conditions for this. If we want to talk to someone, 
we can take the initiative to do so. Children during pre-school years need 
the support of adults for such tasks. Lev Vygotsky, a psychologist and 
educator, had outlined the great need that children have for a concerned, 
caring and knowledgeable adult. The pre-school educator must have 
knowledge specifically about the child’s capabilities, more than information 
about the world. By knowing how much a child actually knows and is 
capable of knowing, an adult can help to provide the optimal environment 
wherein learning is easy, enjoyable and meaningful. The tasks given to 
a child should be neither too easy nor too difficult; otherwise a child will 
either lose interest and/or motivation to engage in the activity.

Some of the skills an early childhood professional needs to have are:

zz An interest in children and their development

zz Knowledge about the needs and capabilities of young children

zz Capacity and motivation for interacting with children

zz Skills for creative and interesting activities with children in all areas 
of development

zz Enthusiasm for activities like story-telling, exploration, nature and 
social interaction

zz Willingness and interest in answering children’s queries

zz Capacity for understanding individual differences
109

Unit III - Human Development And 

Family Studies



zz Be energetic and prepared for physical activity for considerably long 
periods of time

Further, in order to prepare for a career in this field, it is essential to 
have studied about children’s development and basic principles of care. 
For this you will be required to have an undergraduate degree in a subject 
that has child/human development and/or child psychology as part of 
the course. However, if there a desire to enter into the field soon after 
completion of schooling, there is also the option of one year diploma or 
Open University educational courses in the field. Nursery Teacher Training 
is another course that offers training in this field. 

In addition to the courses that one can attend, and degrees that can 
be acquired, it is also important to remember that having a predisposition 
to be open and interactive with children is a fundamental requirement if 
one wants to become an effective early childhood specialist. The person 
should also be aware of the community and culture so that the pre-school 
activities are in the context of the culture and regional environment in 
which the child is growing up. The teacher also needs to be capable of 
administrative and management skills that are required for record keeping, 
accounting, report-writing so that the institution maintains proper records, 
and the contact and interaction with the parent community is effective and 
productive. 

It is also extremely helpful for a teacher to be equipped with a good 
repertoire of skills in the arts. The skills of story-telling, dance, music, 
voice modulation, of organising playful outdoor and indoor activities are 
mandatory when working with children. The training courses will offer 
several such sessions for the trainees but it is also important for a person 
to be deeply engaged with and willing to interact with children in several 
different ways. 

Young children have a short attention span when compared with older 
children and adults. Hence, it is not only important to be prepared with 
several activities, it is also essential to be adaptive and flexible with children, 
rather than focussed on completing one’s own plan of action. A pre-school 
teacher has often to quickly change her lesson plan, her strategies and 
techniques to deal with the needs of young children so that s/he can be an 
effective teacher. For this, good preparation of a large repertoire of activities 
and skills is essential before entering the career with children. 

Scope

The scope of early childhood care and education is very widespread. A 
110 person who is trained as an educator or caregiver for young children can 

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



either work as teacher in a nursery school, a caregiver in a crèche or as a 
member of a team of people working for programmes with young children. 
Additionally, several governmental and non-governmental organisations 
hire professionals for planning and promoting campaigns or services for 
young children. A person can also set up his or her own child care and 
education-related programme as an entrepreneur, which would mean 
setting up one’s own programme, either at home or in a separate space. 
Such an enterprise would require the expertise related to organisation and 
management of such institutions over and beyond the training as a child 
care worker and educator. Depending on your qualification and interest, 
you can also find a job as coordinator of a programme run by someone 
else or as a trainer of teachers in the same subject. If you wish to pursue 
higher studies, you can enrol in a post-graduate diploma or degree in early 
childhood education and go on to a doctoral degree in the field which will 
equip you to do further research in the field and also take on other more 
senior activities as a professional in the field.
Some of the commonly available services in this field are:
zz Crèches

zz Day care centres

zz Nursery schools

zz NGOs

zz ICDS

zz Training institutes

cAreers

zz Teacher in Nursery schools 

zz Caregiver in day care centres and crèches

zz Team members for programmes for young children

zz Professionals to plan and promote campaigns or services for 
young children organised by Governments or NGOs

zz Entrepreneur in child related activities: Camps, edu-picnics, 
activity clubs, preschool education centres

zz Higher studies: a post-graduate diploma or degree in early 
childhood education, later doctoral degrees with research in 
the field.

PracTical 1

Theme:  Activities for preschool children

Tasks: 1. Visit to playground or outside open area

 2. Collection of play material

Purpose: This practical is intended to prepare the student for planning 
and preparing materials for the activities with young children. A specific 
emphasis is placed on using locally available low-cost or no-cost material.

Conducting the Practical 

1. Divide the class into groups of 5 students each. Together, take a walk 
around the playground in your school or any open area outside the 
school. 

2. Look around; collect any materials that you think would be clean, 
safe and appropriate for play with young children. Some suggestions 
are: rocks, stones, pebbles, flowers, leaves, sticks. 

3. Once you have collected the material be sure to clean it properly so 
that it can be used with children.  

4. Each group should prepare one activity for children using any one or 
more of the following concepts:

 • Colour • Texture
 • Number • Shape
 • Type of material • Size

  

Example 1: Taking leaves of different sizes and shapes, arrange the leaves 
collected into two sets based on size and shape. Try to identify the plants or 
trees from which these leaves are taken. Taking two sheets of newspaper, 
paste the leaves in the two sets. Discuss the names of plants/trees from 
which the leaves are taken. Other suggestions can be to discuss colour of 
leaves, matching flowers, names of plants. 
Example 2: Using the same material, the children (with your guidance) 
can make a scenery depicting a home, school or forest where some portions 
can be drawn or painted and some can have materials collected stuck on 
the paper. The same can also be done on the floor or wall. In case there is 
any local craft or art that is indigenous to the area in which the children 
live, care must be taken to link with the folk activity so that children’s 
home environment is also attended to.

Example 3: Children can be made to act like birds, animals and insects 
around the foliage that has been collected. Discussions can take place 113

Reprint 2025-26

Unit III - Human Development And 

Family Studies



about which animals they have seen that eat foliage. Other characteristics 
of animals can also be discussed. 

These are a few examples: the teacher in a classroom can actually 
plan many activities around the same play material depending upon what 
gets the children interested. Story–telling and role play is particularly 
fascinating for children.

PracTical 2

Theme: Preparation and use of teaching aids, using indigenous and 
locally available material to communicate socially relevant messages for 
children, adolescents and adults in the community.

Note for the teacher: Several practicals are being suggested based on 
the objectives stated in this assignment. You may divide your class 
into four groups so that of the four practicals being proposed, one 
group of students conducts one practical.  At the end they share their 
materials and experiences.

Task: Make a puzzle for young children with indigenous material.
Purpose: Providing learning experiences of developing and preparing play 
material; for example, a puzzle so that young children’s development be 
facilitated.

Conducting the Practical 

1. Instruct the students to bring used boxes made of cardboard (gatta)/
old notebook’s cover.

2. Students are instructed to draw two single identical pictures of any 
animal e.g., Fish/elephant or locally available food article e.g., mango, 
banana.

3. Paint the pictures in bright colours.

4. Stick one picture on the inside of the box/cover of the notebook.

5. The other identical picture should be glued on the other cardboard.

6. After the picture dries, cut it into four pieces.

7. Arrange the pieces on the picture stuck on the cardboard box.

8. The puzzle is ready.
9. Puzzles can also be made out of drawings that are taken from the 

114 newspaper or magazines. Cut pictures can also be used to make a 

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



scrap book with cut pictures and drawings. Some ideas for scrap books 
are a collection called my family, or my school, or my neighbourhood, 
village. Pictures of fruits, animals, household objects, natural things, 
can be used for several activities like these. 

PracTical 3

Theme: Preparation of play materials

Task: Making puppets and masks

Purpose of the Practical: The students have to learn how to make play 
material for children. Young children enjoy playing with masks and also 
drawing and creating materials themselves. When such an activity is done 
with 4 – 6 year old children, they should be involved in the making of the 
material. Low cost materials have to be used. Usage of masks and puppets 
promotes language and socio emotional development.

Conducting the Practical

Collect stiff paper, newspaper, pieces of cloth, thread, leaves and flowers 
(for colouring the paper). Take a piece of paper and then do as instructed 
below:-

1. Draw a face on it the size of a 10-year-old child’s face. Draw an outline 
of a mask in the image of a sun, flower or any animal.

2. Draw a small face and join to it pieces of cloth as arms, legs and hair.
3. Using the prepared puppets and masks, tell a story or do a role-play 

as an interactive activity.

4. Analyse what children can learn through such an activity.

Note for the teacher: Supervise the making of masks with or 
without children and guide the discussion about learning 
outcomes.

Significance 

Family is the basic unit of the society and one of its chief functions is 
to look after the needs of its members. The members in a family could 
include parents, their children of various ages and the grandparents. The 
composition of the family will vary from one household to another but at 

116

Reprint 2025-26



different stages in its life cycle, the family has different composition and the 
members together try to meet each others’ needs. However, a family cannot 
always provide all the specialised services that are needed for the optimal 
growth and development of its members. For example, young children 
need formal education; all the members need health care. Therefore, each 
community creates other structures like schools, hospitals, universities, 
recreation centres, training centres which provide specialised services or 
support services which can be accessed by different members of the family 
to meet their needs. 

Generally a family, along with other structures of the society like 
schools, hospitals etc., is expected to meet the needs of its members. 
However many families in our country are unable to meet even the basic 
needs of their members and/or access as well as utilise the various services 
provided by other structures of the society due to various reasons, one of 
them being lack of resources, especially financial. See the box given below 
for some pertinent details in this regard. Further, many children, youth 
and elderly are separated from their families and are left to cope on their 
own. By themselves, they find it difficult to meet their own needs. 

zz Poverty in India is widespread, with the nation estimated to 
have a third of the world’s poor.

zz According to the Planning Commission of India, in 2011–2012, 
29.5 per cent of the population was living below the national 
poverty line.

zz Less than 30 per cent of our population has access to adequate 
sanitation facilities.

zz Less than half of all deliveries in a year are conducted by trained 
birth attendants, which is a cause of high maternal and infant 
mortality and morbidity.

zz Less than half the country’s households consume iodised salt. 
Lack of iodine adversely affects mental and physical growth of 
the child. 

zz Pervasive discrimination against girls and women, which is 
reflected in a range of adverse indicators, including nutritional 
and educational outcomes, and the declining ratio of girls to 
boys, particularly in the youngest age group, are matters of 
concern.

117

Unit III - Human Development And 

Family Studies



For such families, or the members who are in challenging and difficult 
circumstances, the state/society has to step in and make efforts to look 
after the needs of its members. This is because it is the responsibility of the 
government and society to ensure that all citizens have a decent life, and 
children and youth have opportunities for holistic development in a healthy 
and stimulating environment. One of the ways in which the government 
responds to the needs of those who are in difficult circumstances, is 
by setting up institutions and initiating programmes dedicated to the 
children, youth and the elderly. It also provides support to the efforts of 
the private sector and/or the NGO sector. Some of these institutions and 
programmes may focus on meeting specific needs while some programmes 
adopt a holistic perspective and provide intervention and services to meet 
various needs of the individuals together. The latter approach stems from 
the philosophy that all the needs of the individual must be met together to 
have optimal impact.

Basic Concepts 

Why are we focussing more on children, youth and elderly?  This is 
because these are ‘vulnerable’ groups in our society. What do we mean by 
‘vulnerable’? The word ‘vulnerable’ refers to those persons / groups in a 
society, who are more likely to be affected by adverse circumstances and 
on whom adverse circumstances are likely to have a more harmful impact. 
What makes children, youth and elderly vulnerable? This can be answered 
by understanding the needs of these groups. If the needs of any individual 
are not met in the course of daily life, that person becomes vulnerable.  

Activity 1

Form three groups in the class and on the basis of what you learned 
in Class XI, list the needs of (i) Children, (ii) Youth, (iii) Elderly. Try 
to list (at least 5-8) of the special characteristic needs for each group. 
A group leader should then present the list of each group to the rest 
of the class.

Why are Children Vulnerable?

Children are vulnerable because childhood is a period of rapid development 
in all domains, and development in one area influences development in all 
others. In order for the child to grow optimally in all areas, it is important 

118

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



that the child’s needs for food, shelter, health care, love, nurturance and 
stimulation be met in a holistic manner. Adverse experiences can have a 
lasting impact on the child’s development. 

All children are vulnerable, but some are more vulnerable than others. 
These are the children who are living in such challenging conditions and 
difficult circumstances that their basic needs of food, health, care and 
nurturance are not met and this prevents them from developing their full 
potential.
Box given below clearly highlights that the needs of a large proportion of 
child population are not met.

zz Nearly two–thirds of children under five years of age suffer 
from moderate or severe malnutrition. Malnutrition affects 
development in all areas. 

zz About 3 million children live on the streets without any shelter. 
zz Only one in three children of the pre-school age has the 

opportunity to be in an early learning programme. 
zz Less than half of India’s children between ages 6 and 14 years 

go to school. 
zz A little over one-third of all children who enrol in Standard I 

reach Standard VIII. The others drop out of school for one or 
the other reason.

zz 17 million children in India work, as per official estimates. The 
actual numbers may be even more. According to the World 
Bank the number may be 44 million.

All children in difficult circumstances need care and protection but 
some may violate the law or be involved in anti-social activities. The 
Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 is the first 
legal framework for juvenile justice in India. The Act concerns itself with 
two categories of children: those who are “in conflict with law” and those 
considered to be “in need of care and protection.” Children “in conflict with 
law” (also called juvenile delinquents)  are those who have been caught 
by the police for violating the Indian penal code. In other words, they are 
arrested by the police because they have committed/ are accused of a 
crime. The Act provides for a special approach towards the prevention 
and treatment of juvenile delinquency and provides a framework for the 119

Reprint 2025-26

Unit III - Human Development And 

Family Studies



protection, treatment and rehabilitation of children. It relates to ‘juveniles 
in conflict with law’ and ‘children in need of care and protection’, by 
providing for proper care, protection and treatment, by catering to their 
development needs, and by adopting a child-friendly approach in the 
adjudication and disposition of matters in the best interest of children and 
for their ultimate rehabilitation through various institutions. This Act is in 
compliance with the Child Rights Convention and the identified children 
in need of care and protection are those: 

zz who are without any home or settled place or abode or without any 
means of sustenance. This includes abandoned children, street 
children, runaway children and missing children;

zz who live with a person (guardian or not) who is unfit to exercise 
control over the child or where there is a chance of the child being 
killed, abused or neglected by the person;

zz who are mentally or physically challenged, ill or suffering from terminal 
illness or incurable disease and have no one who can support or look 
after them;  

zz who are abused, tortured or exploited for purpose of sexual abuse or 
illegal acts;

zz who are vulnerable to being inducted into drug abuse or trafficking;
zz who are victims of armed conflict, civil commotion, or natural calamity;
zz who are likely to be abused for unconscionable gain. These include 

abandoned, orphaned, trafficked minors rescued from red-light area, 
child labourers rescued from factories, lost, runaways, special needs 
children and children of prisoners.

Institutions, Programmes and Initiatives for Children

There are several programmes and services operating in the country to 
meet the needs of vulnerable children. Here we shall briefly describe 
some significant initiatives and efforts in order to acquaint you with the 
various activities carried out by the government and the non-governmental 
organisations.
zz Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) of the Government of 

India. It is the world’s largest early childhood programme which 
aims to meet the health, nutrition, stimulation and early learning / 
education needs of children below six years of age in an integrated 
manner so as to foster their development. The programme offers 
health, nutrition and hygiene education to mothers, non-formal 

120

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



pre-school education to children aged three to six, supplementary 
feeding for all children below six years and diet for pregnant and 
nursing mothers, growth monitoring and basic healthcare services 
such as immunisation and vitamin A supplements. The programme 
today covers over 41 million children.  These services are delivered 
in an integrated manner at the childcare centre named ‘anganwadi’. 

zz SOS Children’s Villages: This is an independent non–governmental 
social organisation which has pioneered a family approach to the 
long term care of orphaned and abandoned children. SOS villages 
have the vision of providing family-based, long-term care to children 
who can no longer grow up with their biological families. In each 
SOS home there is a ‘mother’ who looks after 10-15 children. This 
unit lives like a family and the children experience relationships 
and love once again, which helps children to recover from traumatic 
experiences. They grow up in a stable family environment, and are 
supported individually until they become independent young adults. 
The SOS families live together, forming a supportive ‘village’ 
environment. They are integrated with the local community and 
contribute to the social life.

In India, the first SOS village was set up in 1964. Now the organisation 
cares for about 6000 needy/abandoned children in 40 unique 
villages across the country. Whenever India has experienced unrest 
or environmental and natural disasters like the toxic gas accident of 
1984 in Bhopal, or devastating cyclones, , catastrophic earthquakes 
as well as Tsunami the SOS Children’s Villages rendered immediate 
assistance with emergency relief programmes, which were converted 
into permanent facilities, mostly SOS Children’s Villages.   

zz Children’s Homes run by the Government for children from 3–18 years 
who are in state custody for various reasons. 

There are three kinds of homes for children:
  a) Observation Homes where children stay temporarily till the 

completion of an investigation to track down their parents and 
collect information on their family background. 

 b) Special Homes where juveniles (children under 18 years of age) 
found guilty in terms of violation of law, are placed in custodial care.

121

Reprint 2025-26

Unit III - Human Development And 

Family Studies



 c) Juvenile /Children’s Homes where children whose families are not 
traceable, or are unfit/dead or simply unwilling to take the child 
back stay. The government is responsible for providing room, board, 
education, and vocational training. Most of these Homes are run by 
government in partnership with NGOs. Efforts are made to help the 
children develop skills which will enable them to become productive 
members of society.

  • Adoption:  India has a long tradition of child adoption. Earlier 
adoption was limited within the family and was covered by social 
and religious practices. But with changing times, adoption 
beyond the family has been institutionalised and legalised. 
While the Government of India and State Governments 
provide necessary support and guidance through policies 
and programmes, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) 
provide necessary delivery systems for the process of adoption. 
In order to strengthen adoption rules and facilitate adoption, 
the Government of India under the advice of the Supreme 
Court has constituted a Central Agency, Central Adoption 
Resource Authority (CARA), to set up guidelines for adoption 
to safeguard the welfare and rights of children. 

Why are Youth Vulnerable? 

The National Youth Policy, 2014 defined ‘youth’ as persons in the age group 
of 15–29 years. Those between 13 and 19 years are called adolescents. 
Our national progress depends, crucially, on the ways and means through 
which youth are encouraged and nurtured as a positive force for national 
growth and are enabled to contribute to socio-economic development. 
Youth is a vulnerable period due to many reasons. During this period an 
individual is trying to come to terms with many biological changes in her/
his body which have an impact on the person’s sense of well-being and 
identity. This is also the period when the individual is preparing to take on 
adult roles, two of the foremost being earning a livelihood and marriage, 
followed by raising a family.

Peer pressure and pressure to excel in an increasingly competitive 
world are other factors that can cause a lot of stress and turmoil. When 
the family/environment is unable to provide positive support to the 

122

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



adolescent, some adolescents may consume alcohol and drugs (also termed 
substance abuse). Such maladjustive behaviour for combating stress is 
on the rise. Health is another aspect which is of critical concern. Youth 
face significant risks related to sexual and reproductive health, and many 
lack the knowledge and power to make informed sexual and reproductive 
health choices. Within the broad category ‘youth’, there are some groups 
who are especially vulnerable. They are:
z Rural and Tribal Youth;
z Out-of-school Youth;
z Adolescents, particularly female adolescents;

z Youth with disabilities;

z Youth under specially difficult circumstances like victims of trafficking, 
orphans  and street children.

In order to be socially useful and economically productive, youth need 
appropriate education and training, gainful employment and adequate 
opportunities for personal development and advancement. They also need 
requisite shelter and a clean environment, as also basic health services 
of quality, social defense and protection from all manner of exploitation. 
Suitable participation in decision-making bodies which are concerned 
with issues relating to the youth, and with socio-economic and cultural 
matters, as well as  access to sports, physical education, adventure and 
recreational opportunities are other requisites.

Youth Programmes in India 

The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports adopted the National Youth Policy 
in 2003. 
zz The National Service Scheme (NSS) aims at involving college level 

students in programmes of social service and national development 
like construction and repair of roads, school buildings, village ponds, 
tanks, activities related to environmental and ecological  improvement 
like tree plantation, removal of weeds from lakes, digging pits, 
activities related to hygiene and sanitation, family welfare, child-care, 
mass immunisation, vocational training in craft, tailoring, knitting, 
and organising co-operatives. NSS students also render assistance to 
local authorities for implementing of various relief and rehabilitation 
programmes to meet the needs of the economically and socially 
weaker sections of the community.

zz The National Service Volunteer Scheme provides opportunities 
to students (who have completed their first degree) to involve 
themselves, on a whole-time basis for a short period of one or two 
years, in programmes of national development mainly through Nehru 
Yuva Kendras.  They are involved in programmes of adult education, 
establishment of youth clubs, organisation of work camps, youth 
leadership training programmes, vocational training, promotion of 
rural sports and games, etc.  The Nehru Yuvak Kendras also aim 
to enable the non-student youth of the rural areas to contribute to 
development in the rural areas. Through the various activities the 
Kendras aim to popularise nationally accepted objectives such as 
self-reliance, secularism, socialism, democracy, national integration 
and development of scientific temper. Some such activities are 
non-formal education, social service camps, development of sports 
activities for young people, cultural and recreational programmes, 
vocational training, youth leadership training camps and promotion 
and establishment of youth clubs. These activities are organised for 
the purpose of helping the non-student youth acquire literacy and 
numeracy skills for self-reliance, upgrade their functional capabilities, 
and make them aware of possibilities of their development, thus 
making the youth functionally efficient, economically productive and 
socially useful.          

zz Promotion of Adventure: Many youth clubs and voluntary 
organisations organise activities like mountaineering, trekking, 
hiking, exploration for collection of data, study of flora and fauna in 
the mountains, forests, deserts and sea, canoeing, coastal sailing, 
raft-exhibitions, swimming, cycling, etc., by using the financial 
assistance provided by the government for promotion of adventure. 
These activities are aimed at encouraging the spirit of adventure, 
risk-taking, co-operative team-work, capacity of ready and vital 
response to challenging situations and endurance among the 
youth.  Government also provides assistance for establishment and 
development of institutions to facilitate such activities. 

zz Scouts and Guides: The Government provides financial support for 
training scouts and guides, organising rallies, jamborees, etc. This 
aims at developing the character of boys and girls to make them 
good citizens by inculcating in them a spirit of loyalty, patriotism and 
thoughtfulness for others.  It also promotes balanced physical and 
mental development and inculcates a desire for social service.

zz Commonwealth Youth Programme: India is participating in the 
Commonwealth Youth Programme which is aimed at making the youth 
participate in development processes of their respective countries and 

124

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



to provide a forum for increasing co-operation and understanding 
among the Commonwealth countries. Under this programme, three 
regional centres for advanced studies in youth work have been set up 
in India, Zambia and Guyana. The Asia Pacific Regional Centre has 
been set up at Chandigarh, India.    

zz Promotion of National Integration: Financial assistance is given by the 
Government to many voluntary agencies to organise visits of youth 
living in one state to another state with marked cultural differences, in 
order to promote greater understanding of the historical and cultural 
heritage of the country, of the problems being faced by the people of 
different regions and environment, social customs etc. in other parts 
of the country. Camps, seminars, etc. are also organised with the 
objective of promoting national integration.

Why are the Elderly Vulnerable? 

In a number of countries, a Senior Citizen is a person in the age group 
65 years and above. However, in India Senior Citizens constitute persons 
in the age group of 60 years and above. There has been a steady rise in 
the population of older persons in India, since life expectancy, which was 
approximately 29 years in 1947, has increased to 69.3 years in 2009–13 
for females and 65.8 years for males. India is home to the second largest 
number of Senior Citizens in the world after China. The number of elderly 
will account for nearly 9 per cent of the population in 2016. (Source: 
Human Development Report). 
The special features of the elderly population in India are: 
zz Majority (80%) of them are in the rural areas, thus making service 

delivery a challenge

zz Feminisation of the elderly population 

zz Increase in the number of the older-old (persons above 80 years)  
zz A large percentage (30%) of the Senior Citizens is below the poverty 

line.
The elderly are a vulnerable group due to various reasons. Firstly, 

health is a major concern for many individuals at this age. The elderly are 
more vulnerable to disease because of decreased physiological reserves 
and defence mechanisms. Besides illness, the aging process itself leads 
to certain disabilities such as low vision and blindness resulting from 
cataracts, deafness resulting from nerve impairment, loss of mobility from 
arthritis and a general inability to care for oneself.

125

Reprint 2025-26

Unit III - Human Development And 

Family Studies



Secondly, in the family life cycle for many, this may be a period when 
they find themselves alone because the children are likely to have moved 
away from the family either because of marriage or to earn a living. 
Many may experience feelings of loneliness, isolation and a sense of 
being a burden on others. Many individuals find themselves financially 
dependent on the younger generation which may add to their feeling of 
stress. Further, especially in metropolitan cities, there is fragmentation 
of the traditional family network and the traditional value system is also 
undergoing change. Certain features of city life (small family size, nuclear 
families, lack of free time to care for the aged, limited living space, high 
cost of living, long working hours), lead to reduced support within the 
immediate and extended family. Sometimes concepts like privacy, space, 
independence, materialism, focus on self are also responsible for the 
inability to adequately care for the elderly. Thus many elderly persons are 
left to fend for themselves at a time when family support is most necessary 
for them. Ageing has become a major social challenge and it is necessary 
to provide for the economic and health needs of the elderly and to create 
a social milieu which is conducive and sensitive to emotional needs of the 
elderly. 

The above description should not make you think that there are only 
problem and difficulties in old age. Many old people continue to live fulfilling 
lives. In many families the elderly are well respected and continue to find 
fulfillment. One positive feature concerning the elderly population is that 
most 60 or more years old are economically active, presumably because 
they are engaged in sectors for which there is no specific age of retirement. 
What is needed is to recognise the elderly as a human resource and their 
rich experience and residual capacities be put to optimum use for the 
benefit of national development. Their ability to lead healthy and fruitful 
lives should be ensured by the Government. The government adopted the 
National Policy for Older Persons in 1999. 

Activity 3

Divide the class into two groups. Let one group discuss the situation 
of elderly in their neighbourhood. The other group should discuss how 
the elderly can contribute to family and society. Let the discussion of 
each group be presented to the class through a group leader.

zz Training of Caregivers for older persons; 

zz Sensitising programmes for children, particularly in Schools and 
Colleges;

zz National Old Age Pension Scheme (NOAPS) meant for old persons

subsistence on their own or through financial support from family 
members. Beneficiaries should be above 65 years, need to provide 
proof of age and their destitute status. The state governments can 
add to the amount from their own resources.

Preparing for a Career

In this career choice, you may either work as in-charge or manager of 
certain activities in an already functioning programme/institution, or you 
may choose to initiate set up of an organisation/programme for the youth, 
children or the elderly. Whatever be the case, it will be a career for which 
you will be required to develop a broad knowledge base and multiple skills. 

Let us first understand what management of institutions and 
programmes involves. A career in management of institutions and 
programmes for children, youth and elderly will need honing of the 
abilities and skills of a planner, manager and an evaluator, may be even 
an entrepreneur as well as strong knowledge of the needs, characteristics 

128

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part 1



and modes of care giving for the target group would also be necessary. 
The following are some skills and abilities you will need to develop:
zz People Skills: Running or working in an organisation means 

interacting with people in different roles and from different 
backgrounds. The following are some groups of people you are likely 
to interact with: 

 (i) The Community: A programme or an institution for children 
will be successful if the community feels a sense of 
involvement and ownership with it. This happens when the 
programme is planned by involving the people for whom 
it is intended right from the start. Participatory planning, 
management and implementation are the pillars of effective 
programmes. Thus, building linkages with the community 
and invoking community participation will be a major aspect 
of your work. 

 (ii) The Private Sector: The private sector financial institutions, 
companies and organisations have come in a big way to 
support innovative programmes and institutions. This is a 
positive step as it is an opportunity for the private sector to 
discharge its social responsibilities. 

 (iii) The Officials in the Government: You may need to interact with 
government departments for various purposes, including 
funding and fulfilling other legal requirements. 

 (iv) People within the organisation: For smooth functioning 
of the organisation, it is important that the people (both 
beneficiaries and personnel working therein) enjoy a 
harmonious relationship with each other. Cultivating cordial 
interpersonal relations is a major factor in the success of an 
organisation. 

zz Administrative Skills: Running or managing an organisation or 
programme involves handling finances, recruiting personnel, renting 
space, buying equipment, maintaining records and stocks. While 
there may be other specific people dealing with each of these aspects, 
it would also be necessary and helpful for you to have a basic 
understanding of the issues involved in each of these. 

Some person may even wish to start and establish a new organisation 
for some specific needy target group. Such enterprising person will need 
to consider the aspects of  appropriate location, who should it cater to 
suit the target beneficiaries, the services/combination of services to be 
provided, finances to run the organisation, recruitment of staff with 

129

Reprint 2025-26

Unit III - Human Development And 

Family Studies



different skills and knowledge base to handle the various aspects of the 
programme including handling formalities of registering the organisation, 
implementing the programme, improving the activities based on periodic 
evaluation and feedback.

Last but not the least, the person needs to have vision about what 
he/she wants to achieve, how the organisation will contribute to meeting 
the needs of the target group. A person with a vision is usually deeply 
committed to that cause and has a strong passion for work in that area. 

The need for programmes and institutions for children, youth and 
elderly which provide quality services will continue to remain a basic need 
of civil society. The first step in preparation for this career is to develop 
a knowledge base and an understanding about children, youth and the 
elderly. Towards this end, it will be appropriate to obtain an undergraduate 
degree in Home Science (also known by other names such as Family and 
Community Sciences) or Social Work or any other social sciences. These 
degree programmes usually focus on such three vulnerable groups in 
the population. You can chose to enter the employment market after the 
undergraduate degree or choose to study further. Along with pursuing 
a programme of study through the conventional system, you can also 
explore the opportunities provided by the Open and Distance learning in 
the country to pursue programmes which will equip you to work with the 
children, youth and elderly. The Indira Gandhi National Open University 
offers programmes which may be of interest to you. These programmes 
can be done along with studying for the regular degree course. Some such 
courses are 

– Certificate Programme in NGO Management 
– Diploma in Youth Development Work

There are State Open Universities as well which offer programmes 
through the distance mode. It will be worthwhile to explore the websites of 
IGNOU and other State Open Universities for more details. 

Scope 

Depending upon the type of programme you wish to be involved with 
and your own inclination, the field offers a variety of possibilities. Career

PracTical 1

Theme:  Care and Welfare of the Elderly.

Task:  To prepare a script and enact a play about dynamics in a 
large joint family.

Purpose: In families there are people of all ages. A healthy, happy family is 
one where the needs and requirements of members of every age-group are 
fulfilled and each member has an important place in the family. Role-play 
is a powerful technique to communicate these dynamics.

Conducting the Practical

A group of 5-6 students are selected and assigned roles of different family 
members: children, parents, grandparents. They are instructed to present 
a 15-minutes role play for which they have to write a script for the different 
characters in imaginary situations.
The role-play will be discussed and analysed to evaluate the students’ 
understanding of the role of the elderly and their place in a family.

Note to the teacher

After the role-play presentation, the teachers should guide the 
discussion with reference to the participation of the elderly in family 
and society, attitude and behaviour of the younger members and the 
well being of the family.

APPENDIX

Syllabus

Human Ecology and 
Family Sciences
(Classes XI-XII)

Rationale

The curriculum in Human Ecology and Family Sciences (HEFS), formerly 
known as Home Science, has been framed keeping in view the principles of 
the National Curriculum Framework-2005 of the NCERT. Traditionally, the 
field of Home Science encompasses five areas, namely, Food and Nutrition, 
Human Development and Family Studies, Fabric and Apparel, Resource 
Management and Communication and Extension. All these domains have 
their specific content and focus that contribute to the study of the individual 
and the family in Indian socio-cultural context. The new curriculum has 
attempted to break away from the conventional framework of the discipline 
in significant ways. In the new conceptualisation the boundaries between 
different areas of the discipline have been dissolved. This has been done 
to enable students to develop a holistic understanding of life in the home 
and society. A special effort has been made to communicate respect for 
every student’s life at home and in society by making the curriculum 
appropriate for both boys and girls, living in different contexts, including 
those who are homeless. It has also been ensured that all the units 
address, in their content, the significant principles of equity, equality and 
inclusiveness. These include gender sensitivity, respect for diversity and 
plurality in relation to rural-urban-tribal location, caste, class, value for 
both traditional and modern influences, concern for society and pride in 
national symbols. Additionally, the novel approach has made concerted 
efforts, to integrate learning at school by building bridges with other 
subjects in the sciences and social sciences. 

The practicals have an innovative and contemporary character and 
reflect the utilisation of new technology and applications that would 
strengthen critical engagement with the lived realities of people. More 
specifically, there is a deliberate shift to field-based experiential learning. 
The practicals are designed to foster critical thinking. Further, conscious 
effort has been made to move away from stereotyped gender roles, thus 135

Reprint 2025-26

Unit III - Human Development And 

Family Studies



making the experiences more inclusive and meaningful for both boys and 
girls. It is imperative that the practicals are conducted keeping in mind the 
resources available with the family and community. 

The course adopts a developmental framework in Class XI using the 
life-span approach, starting with adolescence, the stage of development 
being experienced by the student. Beginning with one’s own stage of 
development would instill interest and enable identification with the 
physical and emotional changes that the student is undergoing. Following 
this is the study of childhood and adulthood. In each unit, the challenges 
and concerns have been addressed along with the activities and resources 
necessary to meet these challenges. 

For Class XI the ‘self and family’ and the ‘home’ are focal points for 
understanding the dynamics of individual lives and social interaction. 
The rationale for using this approach is that it will enable the adolescent 
student to understand herself/himself in the context of the family, which 
in turn is nested within the wider Indian socio-cultural milieu.

For Class XII, the emphasis is on ‘work and careers’ through the life-
span. In this context, work is perceived as essential human activity that 
contributes to the development and sustenance of individuals, families 
and society. Its value is not linked only to its economic ramifications. 
The student will be helped to explore the significance of work, jobs and 
careers and their inter relationship. To understand this concept, the 
student will be imparted life skills and work skills in the respective areas 
of HEFS. This will facilitate the acquisition of basic skills and orientation 
to advanced professional skills needed for specialisation in the selected 
fields discussed in the course. It is significant that these skills will be 
useful for the student in her/his personal-social life, as well as serve as a 
springboard for pursuing a career in the future.
