The world over, more and more people wonder, “How do we
solve the problems facing humanity? How can our societies
learn to live in peace and harmony? How can we protect
this beautiful Earth which we all share — and protect it not
only for ourselves but also for all the species that live on it?”
These fundamental questions are simple, but the answers
are not. They cannot be simple, because human societies
are very diverse and complex. If we wish to find answers to
such questions and help build a better future, we first need
to understand our world, and human societies in particular.
That is what Social Science is all about.
You may wonder whether this is a ‘science’ like, say, physics
or chemistry. It is not. The discipline does use scientific

the one hand, there is rapid progress in technology, which
is changing our lives in many ways. On the other hand, the
world is witnessing multiple wars, armed conflicts and
rising social tensions, and our planet’s natural environment
is under great stress. We live in an age of great possibilities
but also great challenges.

methods wherever possible (you will see a few examples
in this textbook), but its focus — human society — is, again,
too diverse to allow the kind of set procedures and fixed
results the sciences come up with.
Social Science has many subdisciplines: geography, history,
political science, economics, sociology, anthropology,
archaeology, psychology and a few more. You need not feel
intimidated by all these terms! While you will study some of
these subdisciplines in the Secondary Stage, in the Middle
Stage we have avoided this classification. Instead, we have
opted for five broad themes. Let us briefly look at them.

Theme A – India and the World:
Land and the People
This first theme includes the basics of the geographical
world around us — some of the main features of our planet
and the way to represent them on a map. Why is this
theme important, when today we can get excellent maps
on a mobile phone? Because it deals with much more than
maps. It also asks how geographical features — oceans,
mountains, rivers, etc. — have shaped entire civilisations
throughout their histories. It is also, in India’s case, about
how its natural setting has contributed to giving this ancient
civilisation a unique identity.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond
Theme B – Tapestry of the Past
A tapestry is a large piece of canvas-like cloth usually
kept as a wall hanging, with pictures and designs on it —
sometimes a historical narrative. Our tapestry is where
we will be painting scenes from the past, beginning with
India’s past. But why should we be at all concerned with the
past? Because it is the key to understanding the present, and
the chapters in this theme will often make this connection
clear. The past is a major source for our identities — it
helps us understand who we are and where we come from.

The past is still with us, in other words. And since history is
unfortunately not all about happy developments, it is useful
to understand where people, governments or rulers went
wrong, and why. Only then can we hope to avoid repeating
those errors.

Theme C – Our Cultural Heritage and
Knowledge Traditions
It has often been said that India has a rich and ancient
culture. True, but what are its main characteristics? Its
guiding principles? How has it manifested itself in India’s
history? And how can it help us to deal with issues of our
times? These are some of the questions that this theme is
exploring, with the objective that every student should
understand some of the cultural foundations of our
civilisation and learn to appreciate their value.
Citizens of any country should know how their political
system functions. India, as the world’s largest democracy,
has an elaborate system working at different levels. What
are its chief characteristics and components? How do the
citizens participate in the overall governance? What are
their rights and also their duties or dharma? Are there
different systems in other countries, and, if so, of what
type? How are different countries supposed to interact?
By studying this theme, we can become more responsible
citizens, understand how the organs of the government
function, and learn to have a say in the policies that affect
us all, whether locally or nationally.

Theme E – Economic Life Around Us
No family can be happy without the essentials of daily
living — at least food, clothing, shelter, access to water in a
first stage; in a second, livelihood for adults and access to
education for the younger ones. Similarly, no country can

develop harmoniously without a sound economy. But how
does an economy work, especially in a huge country like
India? What exactly is money? Where does it come from?
How can it be increased? What economic activities can
people engage themselves in? How are natural and human
resources best managed? This theme will lay down some of
the important concepts and practices that will enable us to
answer these questions.

You will notice that there are many questions in the
preceding paragraphs. This is as it should be — Social
Science is also about the art of asking the right questions.
Only then can we start looking for the right answers. This
also explains the presence of ‘Big Questions’ at the start of
each chapter in this book.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond
You may also be intrigued to find a game of chess and
some ancient Tamil poetry in chapters that apparently deal
with geography; a discussion on the uses of the sari in a
chapter on cultural heritage; the concept of sevā and the
mention of festivals in chapters focusing on economics.
This is deliberate. We believe in bringing elements from
diverse fields together (you will learn later that this is
called ‘multidisciplinarity’). This enriches our perspective.
Indeed, life constantly mixes numerous elements together,
so why should we not?
By now, it should be clear that although Social Science
makes constant use of the past, it seeks to make sense of
the present so as to help us prepare a better future. It is an
exploration and an adventure.

Imagine that you are visiting a city for the first time. How
would you find the places you want to visit? You might ask
a local person for help, or you might look at a map of the
city. In previous grades, you learnt a little about maps, and
in this chapter, we will study them in more detail.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond
India and the World: Land and the People
Let us play a game. Examine the map of this small city
(Fig. 1.1). Imagine that you just got off a train at the railway
station, and you want to visit the bank marked on the
map. Which way would you go? Are there other possible
ways? Can you locate the public garden, the school and
the museum? If you want to proceed from the bank to the
market, which way will you go? This is where a map comes
in handy!

A map is like a treasure guide; it shows you where things
are and how to get to them. Notice the four arrows in the top
right corner of the map; we will soon see how they point to
some specific directions and make maps even more helpful.

Æ As a class activity, form groups of three or four students
each. Let each group try to draw a map of your school
and some of the streets or roads that lead to it, and a few
neighbouring buildings. At the end, compare all the maps
and discuss.

A Map and Its Components
From this simple example, we understand that a map is a
representation, or a drawing, of some area — it may be a
small area (a village, a town, etc.), a bigger area (say, your
district or state), or a very large area like India or even the
whole world. In a map, you look at the surface as if you are
viewing it from the top.
An atlas is a book or collection of maps.

physical maps, which mainly show some natural
features such as mountains, oceans and rivers (see an
example in Fig. 5.2 in this textbook)
political maps, which show details of countries or
states, boundaries, cities, etc. (for instance, a map of
India with all its States, Union Territories and their
capitals)
thematic maps, with a specific kind of information
(examples include Fig. 6.3 and Fig. 8.1 in this textbook).

In addition, there are three important components of
maps—distance, direction and symbols. You have already

experienced the first two while navigating the map in Fig.
1.1. Let us now define them more precisely.
Have you ever wondered how a huge place can fit on a small
piece of paper? It is all thanks to the map’s scale. Let us go
back to our map of a small city (Fig. 1.1). Each centimetre
on the map, as printed here, represents a certain distance
on the ground — let us suppose it is 500 metres; we say that
the scale is 1 cm = 500 m. Now, turn to the map of India in
Fig. 5.2 in Chapter 5 of this textbook. The scale is represented in the bottom left corner by a ruler with ‘500’ written
above its length and ‘km’ on the side. It simply means that
this ruler, which measures 2.5 cm in the printed map,
corresponds to 500 kilometres on the ground.
So, the actual distance between two points represented on
the map depends on the scale that the map is using.

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ Draw a simple map of a school’s playground. Let us
assume it is a rectangle, 40 m in length and 30 m in width.
Draw it precisely with your ruler on a scale of 1 cm = 10 m.

Æ Now measure the diagonal of the rectangle. How many
centimetres do you get? Using the scale, calculate the real
length of the playground’s diagonal, in metres.

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ Consider the map of the small city again. Identify the
correct and incorrect statements in the list below:
1. The market is north of the hospital.
2. The museum is southeast of the bank.
3. The railway station is northwest of the hospital.
4. The lake is northwest of the apartment blocks.
Æ Taking your school as the starting point, do you know
approximately in which cardinal direction your home is
located? Discuss with your teacher and your parents.

To make maps more easily understood by a variety of users,
map makers use specific symbols. Different countries use
different sets of symbols. The Survey of India, a government
body, has fixed a set of symbols for maps of India (or parts
of India). A small selection of them is shown in Fig. 1.2 on
page 12.

LET’S EXPLORE
Draw a rough map of your locality or your village, including
your home, school and a few other important landmarks. Show
the cardinal directions and use a few of the symbols shown in
Fig. 1.2 on page 12 to mark some important features.

1 – Locating Places on the Earth
Symbols are another important component of maps. Our
map has small drawings of actual buildings and a few
other elements, but there would not be enough space on the
map of a large city or a country to draw them all. Instead,
a symbol is used to represent these features — symbols for
different kinds of buildings (for instance a railway station,
a school, a post office), for roads and railway lines, and for
natural elements such as a river, a pond or a forest. In that
way, numerous details can be shown in the limited space
available on a map.

Mapping the Earth
12
Mapping the Earth is a little more difficult because our
planet is not a flat surface. It nearly has the shape of a
sphere. (We say ‘nearly’ because it is not a perfect sphere,
but is slightly flattened at the poles. However, in practice,
we will consider it to be spherical.) Representing a sphere
accurately on a flat sheet of paper is not possible. To
understand why, peel an orange in such a way that you
have just three or four large pieces of the skin; then try and
flatten them on a table — you will see that you cannot do it
without tearing them at the edges.
Now, consider a globe, which is a sphere on which a map
is drawn. This may be a map of the Earth, the Moon, the
planet Mars, the stars and constellations in the sky, etc.
The physical object, like the one shown in the drawing on
the next page, is a sphere that is generally made of metal,
plastic or cardboard.

chapter1_310125.indd 12
03-02-2025 04:58:05
Here we will study the globe representing
the Earth’s geography. Because the globe
and the Earth have the same spherical
shape, a globe will better represent the
geography of the Earth than a flat map.
Let us now explore some of its features.

a) Understanding coordinates
Now, consider a chessboard.
To record moves by advanced
players, letters are placed
alongside the main pieces
(from ‘a’ to ‘h’, see the image)
and numbers (from 1 to 8) in
between the two sides. This
simple system allows players
to mark each square and
record every move. Here, the
white side has just opened the
game by moving the queen’s
pawn two squares forward (a
very common opening). So,
the pawn is said to have moved from d2 to d4.

LET’S EXPLORE
Using the same terms, write down your move if you play black
and respond with the same move.

1 – Locating Places on the Earth
Imagine a big market in a city or town, with
neat rows of shops, all the same size. You
want to meet a friend at a stationery shop
inside the market. But your friend does
not know where the shop is. So you would give directions
like, “Meet me at 6 pm at the 7th shop in the 5th row from
the entrance.” This will allow your friend to precisely
determine your location.

13
Reprint 2025-26
chapter1_310125.indd 13
03-02-2025 04:58:06
The system used in these two examples may be called a
system of coordinates. Thanks to their two coordinates,
the stationery shop as well as the chess square on the
chessboard can be precisely determined.
A similar system of coordinates is used in the world of maps
to determine the location of any place on a map. Let us see
how this system works.

b) Latitudes
Let us return to the globe. It is easy to identify the North
Pole and the South Pole on it. Rotate the globe; while it
rotates, the fixed points at the top and bottom are the two
poles. Halfway between them is the Equator; note the circle
marking it (see Fig. 1.3).

Exploring Society: India and Beyond
India and the World: Land and the People
Imagine that you stand on the Equator and travel towards
one of the poles; your distance from the Equator increases.
Latitude measures this distance from the Equator. At any
point of this travel, you can draw an imaginary line that
runs east and west, parallel to the Equator. Such a line is
called a parallel of latitude and it draws a circle around
the Earth. Again, it is easy to note on the globe that the
largest circle is the Equator, while the circles marked by the
parallels of latitude grow smaller as we move northward or
southward (Fig. 1.3).

14
Latitudes are expressed in degrees; by convention, the
Equator is latitude 0° (zero degree), while the latitudes of
the two poles are 90° North and 90° South respectively; this
is noted 90°N and 90°S.
There is a connection between latitude and climate. Around
the Equator, the climate is generally hot (it is also called
‘torrid’). As you travel away from the Equator towards one
of the two poles (in other words, as your latitude increases),
the climate becomes more moderate (or ‘temperate’). And
closer to the North or South Pole, the climate grows colder
(or ‘frigid’). You will learn in Science why this is so, and
Reprint 2025-26
chapter1_310125.indd 14
03-02-2025 04:58:06
also why we experience different seasons in the course of
a year.

Fig. 1.3. This globe shows both parallels of latitude and
meridians of longitudes
Imagine now that you travel from the North Pole to the South
Pole by the shortest possible line. Observe the globe: you
will see that instead of passing through Europe and Africa,
you could just as well pass through Asia — the distance
would be the same. These lines are called meridians of
longitude (Fig. 1.3). They are all half-circles running from
one pole to the other.
You will also learn in Science that the Earth spins on its
axis. To put it simply, let’s place a desk lamp a little away
from our globe, focused on it, and imagine that this is

the Sun illuminating the Earth. Slowly rotating the globe
eastward, we can note that for some places on the Earth it
is morning, while for others it is mid-day, evening or night
— when it’s breakfast time in one country, it’s lunchtime in
another and in a third country people are fast asleep! That
is why by measuring the longitude of a place, we will also
be measuring the time at that place. Let us see how.
To measure longitudes, we need to define a reference point
called the Prime Meridian (Fig. 1.3 on page 15). It is also
called Greenwich Meridian because, in the year 1884,
some nations decided that the meridian passing through
Greenwich, an area of London in England, would become
the international standard for the Prime Meridian. It is
marked as 0° longitude.
Just as latitude is a measure of the distance from the
Equator if you travel towards one of the poles, longitude is
a measure of the distance from the Prime Meridian if you
travel along the Equator. Longitude, too, is measured in
degrees. Westward or eastward, it increases in value from
0° to 180°, with the letter ‘W’ or ‘E’ added. For instance,
using round figures, New York’s longitude is 74°W, while
Delhi’s is 77°E and Tokyo’s is 140°E.

16
As you can see on the globe of meridians of longitudes, 180°W
and 180°E are the same longitude; so this longitude is noted
180°, omitting the letter W or E.

Latitude and longitude together are the two coordinates of
a place. With them, you are now able to locate any place on
Earth! You can now understand a statement such as “Delhi
lies at 29°N latitude and 77°E longitude” (these values are
rounded off, not exact).
Fig. 1.3 on page 15 shows the parallels of latitude and the
meridians of longitude together on the globe as blue lines.
Reprint 2025-26
chapter1_310125.indd 16
03-02-2025 04:58:06
All these lines together constitute a grid for the globe; they
are also called grid lines.

latitude and longitude of (1) Mumbai, (2) Kolkata, (3) Singapore,

The Greenwich Meridian is not the first prime meridian.
There were others in the past. In fact, many centuries before
Europe, India had a prime meridian of its own! (Fig. 1.5) It
was called madhya rekhā (or ‘middle line’) and passed through
the city of Ujjayinī (today Ujjain), which was a reputed centre
for astronomy over many centuries. Varāhamihira, a famous
astronomer, lived and worked there some 1,500 years ago.
Indian astronomers were aware of concepts of latitude and
longitude, including the need for a zero or prime meridian.
The Ujjayinī meridian became a reference for calculations in
all Indian astronomical texts.

The map shows a few ancient Indian cities close to the Ujjayinī
meridian. Some are very close to it, while others are a little
away. That is because measuring longitude required accurate
timekeeping, which was not as precise then as it is today.

Understanding Time Zones
Let’s make the globe rotate again from west to east — that
is how our planet spins around its axis, making a full turn
every 24 hours. A full turn is 360°, so this means 15° per
hour (15 × 24 = 360). Let us now mark the meridians of
longitude every 15°. Moving eastward from the Prime
Meridian, we get 0°, 15°E, 30°E, 45°E, and so on every 15°
up to 180°E. It is the same as adding one hour of local time
with each meridian — if it is 12 pm or noon at Greenwich, it
is 1 pm local time at 15°E, 2 pm at 30°E, and so on. But going
westward, it is the other way round — 11 am local time at
15°W, 10 am at 30°W, etc.

LET’S EXPLORE
Two friends, one sitting in Porbandar (Gujarat) and the other
in Tinsukia (Assam), are speaking on the phone late afternoon.
The latter remarks that the sun has set in Assam and it’s
now dark. The former is surprised and says, “But it’s still full
daylight here!” Explain why. And, as a class activity, calculate
the difference in local time between those two cities. (Hint: for
now, consider the difference in longitude between Porbandar
and Tinsukia to be 30°; later, you can find out the precise value.)

The same method can be used to calculate the local time
of any place on the Earth. But it would not be convenient
for a country to use many local times! That is why most
countries adopt a standard time based on a meridian
passing through them. Indian Standard Time (IST) is 5
hours 30 minutes (also noted 5.5 hours) ahead of the local
time at Greenwich (called Greenwich Mean Time or GMT).

LET’S EXPLORE
All these standard times are organised in time zones, which
broadly follow the zones of 15° in the graph (Fig. 1.7). But let
us consider the world map below (Fig. 1.8). We can see that
the lines dividing the time zones are not fully straight. This
is because they have to respect each country’s standard time
and, therefore, tend to follow international borders. The
numbers written inside some countries are the numbers of
hours to be added to GMT to get their standard times if they
have a positive sign, or subtracted from GMT if they have a
negative sign.

From the above explanation, it may seem as if every country
has one standard time. That is not always the case. Some
countries, like Russia, Canada or the USA, are too large to have
a single time zone. The USA has six time zones and Russia has
11 — which means that travelling across Russia from east to
west, you will need to readjust your watch 10 times to align
with the local time!

Similarly, the globe in Fig. 1.9, centred on India, shows
standard times with respect to GMT for a few countries.
Finally, while the Prime Meridian was fixed at Greenwich,
the opposite line — at approximately 180° longitude — is
called the International Date Line.
As you can see on the map, the +12 and the –12 time zones
touch each other at this line. If you cross it by ship or plane,
you need to change the date in your watch. If you cross it

travelling eastward, you subtract a day (say, from Monday
to Sunday); if you cross it travelling westward, you add a day
(from Sunday to Monday). We said that the International
Date Line is ‘approximately’ at 180° longitude, as it deviates
in places to avoid dividing some countries into two different
days!

Oceans and Continents

The ocean is everything. It covers seven-tenths of the
terrestrial globe. Its breath is pure and healthy. It is an
immense desert, where man is never lonely, for he feels life
stirring all around. ... The ocean is the vast reservoir of
Nature. The globe began with the ocean, so to speak, and
who knows if it will not end with it. …

Let us return to our globe and rotate it gently. Or look at
the picture of the Earth seen from the Moon. What is the
most widespread colour you see? Blue, obviously, but what
does it represent? You must have guessed the answer — it
is ‘water’. This means that most of the Earth’s surface is
actually covered with water — almost three-fourths of the
surface, in fact. That is why, when seen from outer space,
the Earth appears mostly blue. Indeed, early astronauts
lovingly called the Earth the ‘blue planet’.
The largest water bodies we see on the globe are called
‘oceans’.
But in the picture of the Earth (Fig. 2.1), you can see at least
one other colour, brown. This colour is that of land, which
covers a little over one-fourth of the globe. A large body of
land is called a ‘landmass’, and a large continuous expanse
of land is called a ‘continent’.
Both oceans and continents play a vital role in shaping the
climate of the Earth. They affect all aspects of life, including
all plants and animals, and therefore, human life too. We
see their impact throughout our history and culture, and in
our daily lives.

The oceans together hold most of the water available on the
planet. But this seawater is salty and unfit for consumption
by most land animals, including humans. On the other
hand, freshwater makes up a very small proportion of the
planet’s water resources; it is found in glaciers, rivers, lakes,
in the atmosphere and also underground (the last is called
‘groundwater’).

THINK ABOUT IT

If there is such abundance of water on the planet, why is
there so much talk of ‘water scarcity’ or a ‘water crisis’?


What ways of saving water are you aware of? Which
ones have you seen practised at home, at your school,
and in your village, town or city?

Oceans
Although we have listed five oceans, it is clear from the
map that they are not really separate. The lines that divide
them on the map are no more than conventions — the
natural world does not follow such boundaries. Seawater,
for example, constantly flows across different oceans,
sustaining a rich diversity of marine life. Many plant and
animal species can be found across multiple oceans.
The marine flora includes tiny plants called algae and all
kinds of seaweeds; the marine fauna consists of thousands
of species of colourful fish, dolphins, whales, and countless
mysterious deep-sea creatures. Each part of the ocean, from
the sun-lit surface to the dark depths, has its own diverse
life forms.

As the map of oceans makes clear, the main limits of the
Indian Ocean are Asia to the north, Africa to the west and
Australia to the east, apart from the Southern Ocean in the
south.


On either side of India, we find two parts of the Indian
Ocean — the Arabian Sea to the west and the Bay of Bengal
to the east.

Fig. 2.4 (on the right). This map of India is
the same as Fig. 1.6, but with the addition of
the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Also
marked are India’s two major groups
of islands (see subsection on ‘Islands’
further below).

Returning to the picture of the
Earth at the start of this chapter,
you may have noticed white
shapes across the globe. Did you
guess what they are? They are
large masses of clouds. Such clouds
bring rain to the continents; for
instance, the monsoon rains we
in India expect every summer
originate in the ocean — without
such rains, our agriculture and all life will suffer. But oceans
often also give rise to storms — violent events with extreme
rainfall or very strong winds, such as cyclones, which can
cause widespread damage to coastal regions of the world.
A tsunami is another natural disaster that originates in the
ocean. It is a huge and powerful wave generally caused by
a strong earthquake or a volcanic eruption at the bottom
of the ocean. Tsunamis can travel thousands of kilometres
and submerge coastal areas, causing widespread damage.

On 26 December 2004, India and another 13 countries
around the Indian Ocean were struck by a powerful
tsunami caused by an earthquake in Indonesia. More
than two lakh people lost their lives. In India, the
Andaman and Nicobar Islands (see Fig. 2.4 above, and
also the subsection ‘Islands’ further below) and the
coasts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala were severely affected
and suffered much damage and loss of life.


Such tsunamis are rare but very destructive. Luckily,
they can often be detected before they hit a coast. Many
countries collaborate in such ‘early warning systems’.
There is, in particular, an Indian Ocean Tsunami
Warning System, to which many countries, including
India, contribute. This helps to take measures to protect
lives and property.

Events that lead to loss of life and property are handled
under disaster management. India has its own
‘National Disaster Management Authority’ to deal with
all kinds of disasters (we will see more examples in the
next chapter).

Continents
34
Continents are visible on the map of oceans (Fig. 2.3). How
many can you count? The answer is not so simple, as they
can be counted in several ways. Depending on our choice,
we may list any number of continents between four and
seven! Here is why:


North America and South America are generally
considered to be two continents; but if seen as a single
landmass, they can also be considered as one.
Europe and Asia are generally considered as two
continents, although the map makes it clear that they
form a single landmass. For historical and cultural
reasons, Europe’s evolution has been very different
Reprint 2025-26
chapter2_310125.indd 34
03-02-2025 04:57:59
from Asia’s, which is why they can be seen as two
continents. Geologists, however, often regard them as
a single continent called ‘Eurasia’.
Africa and Eurasia are generally regarded as two
continents, but sometimes as one.


Let us summarise the different counts in a table:
Count of continents (in alphabetical order)
Four continents
Africa-Eurasia, America, Antarctica, Australia
Five continents
Africa, America, Antarctica, Australia, Eurasia
Six continents
Africa, Antarctica, Australia, Eurasia, North
America, South America (this is reflected in
Fig. 2.3 on page 32)
Seven continents
Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North
America, South America
In practice, the last list of seven continents is the one most
widely adopted and used.

You may have seen the five Olympic
rings, one of the symbols of the
Olympic Games. They symbolise
the gathering of sportspeople from
all over the world. The rings were
chosen to represent five inhabited
continents — Africa, America, Asia,
Australia and Europe.

the continents do not include all landmass. Some smaller
pieces of land are left out; surrounded by water on all sides,
they are called islands. (Continents are also surrounded
by water, but because they are so large, they are not
considered islands.)
There are lakhs of islands on the planet, of very different
sizes.


Greenland is the largest island in the world (locate it on a
globe or a map). You would have to add the areas of the 10
largest states of India to reach its size.


India has more than 1,300 small islands! Those include
two major groups — Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the
Bay of Bengal and Lakshadweep Islands in the Arabian Sea
(see Fig. 2.4).


Since 1981, the Indian Antarctica Programme has been
exploring Antarctica, a continent with a very cold climate
and harsh environment (see the white expanse at the
bottom of Fig. 2.1, which is mostly ice). In 1983, India
established its first scientific base station there, called
‘Dakshin Gangotri’ (two more bases were established
later). About 40 teams of Indian scientists have conducted
research in this faraway region, especially on the evolution
of climate and environment. The settlement where the
scientists live has a library and even a post office!

Oceans and Life
Oceans and continents are vital parts of the environment
and affect most aspects of our lives, even if we do not
notice it. We have mentioned that oceans send rain to the
continents; this is part of the Earth’s water cycle, which
you will further study in Science. Without oceans, for

desert. Moreover, more than half of the world’s oxygen is
produced by the oceans’ flora, which is why they are called
‘the planet’s lungs’. The oceans, therefore, play a crucial
role in regulating the climate and sustaining life on Earth.
Oceans have deeply impacted humanity in many other
ways. From early times, people have used oceans and seas
to migrate to other regions, to trade in all kinds of goods,
to conduct military campaigns, and as a source of food
through fishing. Oceans have also nourished the cultures
of coastal people all over the world. Almost all of them have
tales and legends about the sea, sea gods and goddesses, sea
monsters and treasures from the sea — the oceans’ dangers
but also their blessings.

Scientific studies have shown how the oceans are polluted
by human activity — we throw several million tonnes of
plastic waste into the oceans every year, choking marine life.
There are several other forms of pollution. As a result, the

Introduction
Humans, like most mammals, live on land. Land, as you may
have noticed, has many forms and features; its appearance
changes a lot from one region to another. Suppose that you
are travelling by road from the region known as Chhota
Nagpur in Jharkhand, reach Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh,
and go on to Almora in Uttarakhand. On the way, you will
see very different landscapes. In fact, you will encounter
three major landforms, which we will now explore.

Examples:
the altitude

altitude of a

Æ As a class activity, form groups of four or five students
and observe the school’s surroundings. What kind of
landscape do you see? Will the landscape change a few
kilometres away? Or within some 50 kilometres? Compare
with other groups.
Æ In the same groups, discuss a journey that any of you
has made through a region of India. List the different
landscapes seen on the way. Compare with other groups.

A landform is a physical feature on the surface of our
planet Earth. Landforms take shape over millions of years
and have a significant connection with the environment
and life. They can broadly be divided into three categories
— mountains, plateaus and plains (Fig. 3.1).
These landforms have different climates and are home to
a variety of flora and fauna. Humans have adapted to all
landforms, but the number of people living on different
kinds of landforms varies throughout the world.

Mountains
Mountains are landforms that are much higher than the
surrounding landscape. They can be recognised by a broad
base, steep slopes and a narrow summit. Depending on
their height, some mountains are covered with snow. At
lower altitudes, the snow melts every summer and turns

Fig. 3.1. This drawing illustrates three landforms — mountains in the
background (two of them snow-capped), a plateau on the left and a plain in
the foreground, with a river emerging from the mountains.

Other highlands with a lower height, less steep slopes and
rounded tops are called hills.

THINK ABOUT IT
What is snow? Unless you live in a Himalayan region (such
as Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand,
Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh), you may never have seen
snow! In the rest of India, most precipitation is in the form
of rain and hail. But at higher altitudes, if it is cold enough,
snow will fall, covering the landscape in a soft and beautiful
white blanket. Snow and hailstones are nothing but
precipitation of water in a solid state.

into water that feeds rivers. At high altitudes, the snow
may never melt, leaving the mountain permanently snowcapped.

Mountains with tall and sharp peaks, like the Himalayas,
are relatively ‘young’, which means that they were formed
recently in the Earth’s history — but that is still millions
of years ago! Shorter and more rounded mountains and
hills, like the Aravalli Range, are much older and have been
rounded by erosion. Sometimes, as with the Himalayas,
upliftment as well as erosion continue to this day. (You
will learn more in Science about such processes and their
causes; let us just say here that some mountains of the
world, like the Himalayas, are still growing in height.)

Mountain environment
Mountain slopes are often covered with a type of forest
called montane forest, where conifer trees such as pines,
firs, spruce and deodar are common. These conifer trees
grow tall and cone-shaped, with thin, pointed leaves. At
higher altitudes, the trees give way to grasses, mosses and
lichen.

Here are two verses from a long poem by Kālidāsa, who lived at least
1,500 years ago and is often considered to be the greatest poet of
ancient India. The poem, Kumārasambhava, begins with an invocation
to the Himalayas. (This is a simplified translation from the Sanskrit.)
In the north rises Himālaya, the Lord of mountains, like a
living god, who measures the Earth and stretches from the
western to the eastern oceans. …
From it the wind comes down, carrying spray from descending
Gangā, shaking the deodar trees, opening the peacocks’ tail
feathers and cooling the mountain people after they hunt deer.

‘Ganga’ is the Indian name of the largest river originating in
the Himalayas. In English, ‘Ganges’ is also used. Nearly 2,500 km
long, this river has numerous tributaries (that is, other rivers
joining it). Some of them, like the Yamuna and the Ghagara, also
originate in the Himalayas. Others, like the Son or Sone, originate
from the Vindhya Range to the south of the Ganga plain.

terrace farming. In many mountainous regions of the world,
herding is the preferred occupation over agriculture.
Tourism is often an important source of income for the
people living in the mountains. The crisp mountain air
and scenic beauty attract many tourists. Some tourists
also go to the mountains for sports such as skiing, hiking,
mountaineering and paragliding. For many centuries,
people have also travelled to these uplands for pilgrimages
to holy sites. But an excessive inflow of visitors can also
put the fragile mountain environment under pressure; it is
often difficult to find the right balance.

Many traditional communities around the world consider
mountains to be sacred places and worship them. Mount
Everest, the highest mountain in the world at 8,849 m, has
many names. Tibetans call it ‘Chomolungma’, which means
‘Mother Goddess of the World’ and worship the mountain as
such. Nepalis call it ‘Sagarmatha’, meaning ‘Goddess of the Sky’.
Similarly, Mount Kailash in Tibet is held sacred by followers
of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Bon (an ancient Tibetan
religion). Such reverence for mountain summits is also found
elsewhere in India, as well as in other parts of the world.

Plateaus
A plateau is a landform that rises up from the surrounding
land and has a more or less flat surface; some of its sides
are often steep slopes. Like mountains, plateaus can be
young or old in terms of the Earth’s history. Two examples
of plateaus are the Tibetan Plateau, the largest and highest
plateau in the world, and the Deccan Plateau. The height
of plateaus can vary from a few hundred metres to several
thousand metres.


The Tibetan Plateau has an average altitude of 4,500 m,
which explains why it has been nicknamed the ‘Roof of
the World’! From east to west, it is nearly 2,500 km long
— the distance from Chandigarh to Kanyakumari.


The Deccan Plateau of central and south India is one of
the oldest plateaus in the world, formed through volcanic
activity millions of years ago.

Like mountains, plateaus are rich in mineral deposits; they
have been called ‘storehouses of minerals’. As a result,
mining is a major activity on plateaus, where many of the
world’s largest mines are found. For example, the East

African Plateau is famous for gold and diamond mining. In
India, huge reserves of iron, coal and manganese are found
in the Chhota Nagpur Plateau.
The plateau environment is very diverse across the world.
Many plateaus have a rocky soil, which makes them less
fertile than plains (see next section) and therefore less
favourable to farming. An exception is that of lava plateaus
(that is, formed through volcanic activity), as they often
have a rich black soil.

Plateaus are also home to many spectacular waterfalls.
The Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River in southern Africa,
the Hundru Falls on the Subarnarekha River in the Chhota
Nagpur Plateau and the Jog Falls on the Sharavati River in
the Western Ghats are a few such waterfalls. The Nohkalikai

Plateau (in Meghalaya).

Plains
Plains are landforms that have an extensive flat or gently
undulating surface. They do not have any large hills or deep
valleys. They are generally not more than 300 metres above
sea level.

Sea level:
The average
level of the
surface of
the oceans,
also called
‘mean sea
level’.

Floodplains are one type of plains formed by rivers
originating in mountain ranges, where they collect
particles of rock, sand and silt called ‘sediments’. These
sediments are carried all the way to the plains, where
the rivers deposit them, making the soil very fertile. As a
result, these plains are ideal for growing crops of all kinds,
and agriculture is a major economic occupation in this
landform. Plains also support a variety of flora and fauna.

Life in the plains
Thousands of years ago, the first civilisations developed
around rivers in fertile plains. In our times too, a large part
of the world’s population lives in plains.
About 40 crore people, more than one-fourth of the total
Indian population, live in India’s Ganga plain (often called
the ‘Gangetic plain’). As with many other plains of the
Reprint 2025-26
chapter3_161224.indd 54
03-02-2025 04:57:50
world, the major occupations of people in this region
include river fishing and agriculture. Food crops such as
rice, wheat, maize, barley and millets are grown. Fibre
crops such as cotton, jute and hemp are also grown in the
Gangetic plain. Traditional agriculture has been mostly
rainfed (that is, watered through rainfall). In recent
decades, however, agriculture has turned to irrigation,
with water brought to the fields through networks of
canals or pumped from groundwater. While irrigation has
increased agricultural production, it has also contributed to
the depletion (or decrease) of groundwater. This presents a
challenge for the future of agriculture in the region. Some
of the other problems affecting the Ganga plains include
high population and pollution.
Whether in mountain ranges or plains, rivers around the
world have carried immense cultural value. In particular,
many communities have considered a river’s source and
its confluence with one or two other rivers to be sacred.
In India, numerous festivals, ceremonies and rituals are
conducted at such locations.
Because plains have a gentle slope, river navigation is easy
and supports a lot of economic activities. In earlier days,
people also used rivers extensively to travel from one place
to another. Even today (Fig. 3.10 on page 56), there are
stretches along the Ganga where people prefer to use boats
to move around!

In this chapter, we explored the three main landforms.
But its surface is very complex and experts often define a few
more landforms. One such landform is the desert. Deserts
are considered to be large and dry expanses with very little
precipitation. Their flora and fauna are also unique. Some
deserts are hot, like the Sahara Desert in Africa or the Thar
Desert in the northwest of the Indian Subcontinent. Others
are cold, like the Gobi Desert in Asia. (Some experts also
describe the Antarctica continent as a desert.)
Despite harsh living conditions, humans have adapted to
most of the deserts. In India, communities living in the Thar
Desert, or migrating through it, hold rich cultural traditions,
such as folk songs and legends, related to the desert.
The diverse ways in which humans have made all landforms
their home is a testimony to our adaptability and resilience.

landforms than the one we have seen, but they reflect a keen
awareness of the diverse regions and their characteristics.
They also illustrate the deep connection between humanity
and the natural environment. (You do not need to remember
the details of the tiṇais, but the concepts they reflect need to be
understood.)

Æ
Landforms are classified into three main types —
mountains, plateaus and plains. They have very
different physical characteristics and environments.

Æ
Throughout history, people’s lives and activities have been
much impacted by the type of landform they have lived in.
These landforms are an integral part of culture across the
world. Indian culture, in particular, has celebrated them in
diverse ways.

calendar is commonly used worldwide; side by side, Hindu,

for calculating the dates of festivals and other auspicious
events.
In the West, the conventional year for Jesus Christ’s birth
has generally been taken to be the starting point for this
calendar. Years are counted forward from this point and
used to be marked with ‘AD’ (an abbreviation for a Latin
phrase that refers to the years after Jesus’ birth). However,
this is now called the Common Era or CE across the world.
For example, 1947, the year India gained independence,
can be written as 1947 AD (sometimes AD 1947) or 1947 CE.
Similarly, the years before the conventional date for the
birth of Jesus are counted backward and used to be
marked with BC (or Before Christ). They are now called
Before Common Era or BCE. For example, 560 BCE is an
approximate year of birth of Gautama Buddha (whom we

ago that was?

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ
Such calculations are simple, but there is a catch. In the
Gregorian calendar, there is no ‘year zero’. The year 1 CE
follows immediately the year 1 BCE. Draw a simple timeline
marking every year from 2 BCE to 2 CE; you will see that
because of the absence of a year zero, only 3 years have
passed between those two dates.

Æ
So to calculate the number of years between a BCE date
and a CE date, you should add them but subtract 1 — in the
above case, 2 + 2 – 1 = 3.

Æ
Practice a few examples with your classmates. For example,
to return to the question about the Buddha, suppose we
are now in the year 2024 CE, then the Buddha was born
560 + 2024 – 1 = 2,583 years ago.

Along with a year and a decade (a period of ten years), we often
use other terms to understand longer durations of time. Two of
these are quite commonly used when learning about history.
1.

Century: It is any period of 100 years. In history, specific
centuries are counted every 100 years starting from the
year 1 CE. For instance, we are currently in the 21st century
CE, which runs from 2001 to 2100.

specific centuries are counted every 1,000 years from
the year 1 CE. For instance, we are currently in the
3rd millennium CE, which began in 2001 CE and will go up
to 3000 CE.
As with centuries, millenniums BCE are also calculated
beginning from 1 BCE and go backwards. So the
1st millennium BCE would include the years 1 BCE to
1000 BCE.
In the timeline given on pages 62 and 63 (Fig. 4.3), can
you mark the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE? (Note:
In English, the plural of ‘millennium’ is ‘millenniums’ or
‘millennia’; both are correct.)

Do you know how calendars have been traditionally made in
India? Many Indian calendars rely on the positions of the sun
and the moon to define the months of the year. A pañchānga is
a book of tables which lists the days of each month along with
related astronomical data; for instance, it precisely predicts
events like solar and lunar eclipses, times for sunrise and
sunset, etc. Pañchāngas, still widely used in India, often also
give weather predictions for the year, dates and timings of
festivals, and more.

Have you ever seen old coins, books, clothes,
jewellery or utensils in and around your
house? What type of information can we
gain from such objects? Or from old houses
or buildings?

Every object or structure tells a story and is like a piece in a
jigsaw puzzle. The objects that you see around your house
convey something of the history of your family. Similarly,
we can put together historical events through a variety of
sources. But keep in mind that in the case of history, quite a
few pieces of the puzzle may remain missing!

remember them all now; we will use some of them as we go
along. When historians study, say, a king or queen of 1,500
years ago, an ancient monument, a war or some items of
trade, they take great care to gather information from as
many sources as they can find and consult. Sometimes, the
sources confirm each other (the jigsaw pieces match); at
other times, sources may give contradictory information
(the jigsaw pieces don’t match), in which case they need to
decide which source they can trust more. That is how they
try to re-create the history of the period they are studying.
Who contributes to all these sources of history? Historians
themselves, but also archaeologists, epigraphists (who
study ancient inscriptions), anthropologists (who study
human societies and their cultures), experts in literature
and languages, and some more. In addition, in the last 50
years or so, scientific studies have been contributing more
and more to the reconstruction of the past. For example,
studies of ancient climates, chemical studies of excavated
materials and studies of the genetics of ancient people have
provided fresh insights, which supplement the more usual
sources. And when historians study recent history (which
usually means the last two or three centuries), another
source is newspapers; for the last few decades, electronic
media (television, the internet, etc.) can also be consulted.

The Beginnings of Human History
Modern humans (Homo sapiens) have walked the planet
for about 300,000 (three lakh) years. This appears to be a
very long time, yet it is only a tiny fraction of the Earth’s
history. Let us have a quick look at our early history.

In the above picture, look at some activities of early humans
in a rock shelter. Which ones can you recognise? Give a brief
description for each.

Afterlife:
A life
that begins
after death.

70
Early humans faced many challenges from nature and lived
in bands or groups to help each other. They were constantly
seeking shelter and food, and were mainly hunters and
gatherers; this means that they relied on hunting and
collecting edible plants and fruits for their survival. Our
early ancestors also had certain beliefs about the natural
elements and possibly also some notion of afterlife.

These groups lived in temporary camps, rock shelters or
caves, and communicated with each other using languages
that are now lost. They used fire and started making objects
that made their lives easier, like improved stone axes and
blades, arrowheads and other tools. Aspects of their life
are visible in rock paintings found in hundreds of caves
all over the world. Some of those paintings depict simple
figures or a few symbols; others are more detailed and
represent scenes with animals or humans. In time, these
early humans learned to make simple ornaments such as
stone or shell beads, pendants made of animal teeth, and
sometimes exchanged them with other groups.

The First Crops
Afterwards, living conditions improved for humans; in many
parts of the world, they started settling down and cultivating
cereals and grains. They also domesticated animals such as
cattle, goats, etc. With more food available, these communities
grew in size and number, and often settled down near rivers.
This was not only because of the availability of water, but
also because the soil would be more fertile there. It made the
process of growing crops easier.

LET’S EXPLORE
Observe the scene on the next page. It depicts an agricultural
community from a few millenniums ago. List the main activities
you can identify.

Over long ages, the Earth’s climate has gone through many
changes. At certain times, it was very cold and much of the
Earth was covered with ice — this is called an ‘Ice Age’, as
you will learn in greater detail in Science. Later, when the
climate warmed up, this ice partly melted, and the resulting
waters swelled the existing rivers and eventually drained
into the oceans. The last Ice Age lasted from over 100,000
(one lakh) years ago to around 12,000 years ago.

Both in the earlier picture of a rock shelter and in this one,
men and women are given certain roles. While they may
appear to be ‘natural’, they are not necessarily accurate
and do not cover all situations. For instance, in a rock
shelter, women may have helped prepare colours for
painting the rock or may have done some of the painting.
In both scenes, men may have done some of the cooking or
may have helped take care of children.

Keeping in mind that we have only limited information,

As communities grew, so did their social complexity.
Leaders or ‘chieftains’ were responsible for the well-being
of the people, and everyone collectively worked towards
the community’s welfare. For example, there was no sense
of individual ownership; the lands were collectively sowed
and harvested.
As time went by, hamlets grew into sizeable villages that
exchanged goods — mostly food, clothing and tools. Slowly,
networks of communication and exchange were established
among those villages, and some of them grew into small
towns. New technologies appeared — for example pottery,
for making pots and other clay objects; and the use of metal
(copper first, iron later), which helped make durable tools,
objects of daily use and ornaments.

Welfare:
Health,
prosperity and
well-being.

Hamlet:
A small
settlement or
small village.

We will see in Chapter 6 how this stage prepared for
the emergence of what is called ‘civilisation’. For now,
it is important to remember that this early progress of
humanity had to face many challenges. At some critical
times, humanity could have almost disappeared, as some
earlier species did. We will never know those early humans
to whose courage and persistence we owe our existence
today.

We have explored some ways to learn more about our
pasts. The concept of a timeline helps us understand the
sequence of historical events at different times.

There are different ways of measuring time: years,
decades, centuries, millenniums.

Today, the India we know is a modern nation, with defined
borders, defined states and a known population. However,
it was very different 500 years ago, 2,000 years ago or even
5,000 years ago. This region of the world, which we often call
the ‘Indian Subcontinent’, has had many different names
and shifting boundaries. We can learn about India’s past
and evolution from many different sources. Let us explore.

THINK ABOUT IT
Consider the physical map of the Indian Subcontinent at
the start of the chapter. What are its natural boundaries
that you can make out?

In the course of history, India has been called by many
names — both by its inhabitants and by visitors from outside.
These names come to us from ancient texts, accounts of
travellers and pilgrims, and inscriptions.

Inhabitants:
People who
live in a
particular
place.

The Ṛig Veda is India’s most ancient
text; as we will see in Chapter 7,
it is several thousand years old.
It gives the northwest region of
the Subcontinent the name ‘Sapta
Sindhava’, that is, the ‘land of the
seven rivers’. The word ‘Sindhava’
comes from ‘Sindhu’, which refers
to the Indus River, or at times to a
river in general.

Moving on in time, we see names for other parts of India
appear in the literature. The Mahābhārata is one of India’s
most famous texts (we read about it in the theme ‘Our
Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions’). Interestingly,
it lists many regions, such as Kāshmīra (more or less today’s
Kashmir), Kurukṣhetra (parts of Haryana today), Vanga
(parts of Bengal), Prāgjyotiṣha (roughly today’s Assam),
Kaccha (today’s Kutch), Kerala (more or less today’s Kerala),
and so on.

LET’S EXPLORE
Do you recognise the names of any regions given in the map
(Fig. 5.4) on page 79? List the ones that you have heard of.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond
Tapestry of the Past
But when do we come across a name for the entire Indian
Subcontinent? Because ancient Indian texts are difficult to
date, this is not an easy question to answer. The Mahābhārata
uses the terms ‘Bhāratavarṣha’ and ‘Jambudvīpa’, and
scholars generally agree that this long poem was written
from a few centuries BCE onward.

78
The first term, ‘Bhāratavarṣha’, clearly extends to the entire
Subcontinent, and the text includes the names of numerous
rivers and peoples. ‘Bhāratavarṣha’ means ‘the country of
the Bharatas’. ‘Bharata’ is a name that first appears in the
Ṛig Veda, where it refers to one of the main Vedic groups
of people. In later literature, several kings named ‘Bharata’
are mentioned.
The second term, ‘Jambudvīpa’, means ‘the island of the
fruit of the jamun tree’. This is indeed a common tree native
to India, also called ‘jambul tree’, ‘Malabar plum tree’, etc.
‘Jambudvīpa’ came to mean the Indian Subcontinent.
In fact, we get a good clue from an Indian emperor — his
name is Aśhoka and we will meet him later; for now, we
can take his date to be about 250 BCE. As we will see, he
left us many inscriptions. In one of them, he used the same
Reprint 2025-26
chapter5.indd 78
03-02-2025 04:57:09
name ‘Jambudvīpa’ to describe the whole of India, which
at the time included what is today Bangladesh, Pakistan, as
well as parts of Afghanistan.

A few centuries later, ‘Bhārata’ became the name generally
used for the Indian Subcontinent. For instance, in an ancient
text called the Viṣhṇu Purāṇa, we read:
uttaram yat samudrasya himādreścaiva
dakṣiṇam varṣam tad bhāratam nāma ...
“The country that lies north of the ocean
and south of the snowy mountains is
called Bhārata.”
This name, ‘Bhārata’ remains in use even today. In north
India, it is generally written as ‘Bharat’, while in south
India, it is often ‘Bharatam’.

THINK ABOUT IT
Exploring Society: India and Beyond
Tapestry of the Past
Have you identified the ‘snowy mountains’? Do you think this
brief description of Bhārata is correct?

It is interesting to note that different parts of the country
adopted a similar definition for India. For instance, a poem
of ancient Tamil literature, from about 2,000 years ago,
praises a king whose name is known “from [Cape] Kumari
in the south, from the great mountain in the north, from
the oceans on the east and on the west...” You can now
recognise ‘the great mountain in the north’, and it should
not be difficult to identify ‘Cape Kumari’. It looks like ancient
Indians knew their geography well!

The Indian Constitution, which was first written in English,
uses the phrase ‘India, that is Bharat’ right at the beginning.
Similarly, the Hindi version of the Constitution mentions the
same as ‘Bhārat arthāth India’.

LET’S EXPLORE
In this reproduction of the first page of the original Constitution
of India in Fig. 5.5 (page 82), can you make out the phrase

principles
and laws
of a nation.
The Indian
Constitution,

How Foreigners Named India
The first foreigners to mention India were the Persians,
the ancient inhabitants of Iran. In the 6th century BCE, a
Persian emperor launched a military campaign and gained
control of the region of the Indus River, which, as we saw,
was earlier called ‘Sindhu’. So, it is no surprise that in their
earliest records and stone inscriptions, the Persians referred
to India as ‘Hind’, ‘Hidu’ or ‘Hindu’, which are adaptations
in their language of ‘Sindhu’. (Note that in ancient Persian,
‘Hindu’ is a purely geographical term; it does not refer here
to the Hindu religion.)

Sindhu
Indoi / Indike
Hindhu
The ancient Chinese also interacted with India. In several
texts, they refer to India as ‘Yintu’ or ‘Yindu’. This word also
originally comes from ‘Sindhu’, in the following manner:
Sindhu
Hindhu
Indu
Yindu
5 ― India, That Is Bharat
Based on these Persian sources, the ancient Greeks named
the region ‘Indoi’ or ‘Indike’. They dropped the initial letter
‘h’ of ‘Hindu’ because this letter did not exist in their Greek
language.

Xuanzang (formerly spelt Hiuen Tsang, Hsuan
Tsang, etc.) travelled from China to India in the
7th century CE. He visited many parts of India, met
scholars, collected Buddhist texts, and returned
to China after 17 years. There, he translated
the manuscripts he took back with him from
Sanskrit into Chinese. Several other Chinese
scholars visited India over the centuries.

Another Chinese word, also derived from
‘Sindhu’, was ‘Tianzhu’; but this word could
also be understood as ‘heavenly master’. This
reflects the respect the ancient Chinese had
for India as the land of the Buddha.
You are probably quite familiar with a
more recent term, ‘Hindustān’, but you may
not know that it was first used in a Persian
inscription some 1,800 years ago! Later on, this became

The most ancient civilisation of India, known variously as the
Harappan, Indus or Indus-Sarasvatī Civilisation, was indeed
remarkable in many ways. ... [It showed how] a well-balanced
community lives — in which the differences between the rich
and the poor are not glaring. ... In essence, the Harappan
societal scenario was not that of ‘exploitation’, but of mutual
‘accommodation’.

At the end of Chapter 4, we saw the first human groups
settling down, practising agriculture, developing some
technologies (such as construction, metallurgy, transport)
and moving towards ‘civilisation’.
What, then, is civilisation? In general, the term is used for
an advanced stage of human societies. To be precise, we
will consider here that a ‘civilisation’ should have at least
the following characteristics:








some form of government and administration — to
manage a more complex society and its many activities;
urbanism — town-planning, the growth of cities and
their management, which generally includes water
management and a drainage system;
a variety of crafts — including the management of raw
materials (such as stone or metal) and the production
of finished goods (such as ornaments and tools);
trade both internal (within a city or a region) and
external (with distant regions or other parts of the
world) — to exchange all sorts of goods;
some form of writing — needed to keep records and to
communicate;
cultural ideas about life and the world, expressed
through art, architecture, literature, oral traditions or
social customs;
a productive agriculture — enough to feed not just
the villages, but also the cities.

THINK ABOUT IT
Which of the above characteristics do you think is the most
fundamental — that is, a characteristic essential to the
development of all others?

LET’S EXPLORE
For each characteristic in the list above, can you make a list of
professions or occupations that might exist in such a society?

It is easy enough to see that all these characteristics are
present in most societies in the world today. But when did
civilisation begin, in the sense we have now defined?
Civilisation began at different times in different parts of the
world. In the region known as Mesopotamia (modern Iraq
and Syria), that happened about 6,000 years ago, and the
civilisation in ancient Egypt followed a few centuries later.
You will learn about these and a few more civilisations in a
later grade. In many ways, humanity would not have reached
its present stage without the enormous contributions and
advances of those ancient civilisations.
For now, however, we will only look at the Indian
Subcontinent, and its northwest region is where our story
begins.

From Village to City
Tributary:
A river that
flows into a
larger river
(or lake). For
instance, the
Yamuna is a
tributary of the
Ganga.

The vast plains of the Punjab (today
divided between India and Pakistan) and
Sindh (now in Pakistan) are watered by
the Indus River and its tributaries. This
made those plains fertile and, therefore,
favourable to agriculture. A little further
east, a few millenniums ago, another
river, the Sarasvatī, used to flow from
the foothills of the Himalayas through
Haryana, Punjab, parts of Rajasthan
and Gujarat (see Fig. 6.3). In this whole
region, from about 3500 BCE, villages
grew into towns, and with increasing
trade and other exchanges, those towns
further grew into cities. This transition
happened around 2600 BCE.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond
Tapestry of the Past
Archaeologists gave this civilisation
several names — ‘Indus’, ‘Harappan’,
‘Indus-Sarasvatī’ or ‘Sindhu-Sarasvatī’
civilisation. We will use all these terms.
Its inhabitants are called ‘Harappans’.
It is one of the oldest civilisations in the
world.

DON’T MISS OUT
Why are the inhabitants of this civilisation called ‘Harappans’
today? That is simply because the city of Harappa (today in
Pakistan’s Punjab) was the first of this civilisation to be excavated, way back in 1920–21, over a century ago.

This development is also called the ‘First Urbanisation of
India’.

The map (Fig. 6.3 on page 89) shows the Indus (or

cities grew along those rivers, such as Mohenjo-daro
and Harappa. But there are also many sites along
the Sarasvatī River, which today goes by the name
of ‘Ghaggar’ in India and ‘Hakra’ in Pakistan (hence
the name ‘Ghaggar-Hakra River’). This river is now
seasonal, because it flows only during the rainy season.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond
Tapestry of the Past
The Sarasvatī River is first mentioned in the Ṛig Veda, an
ancient collection of prayers which we will read about
in Chapter 7. In this text, Sarasvatī is worshipped both
as a goddess and as a river flowing ‘from the mountain
to the sea’. Later texts describe the river as drying up
and eventually disappearing.

Town-Planning
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, now in Pakistan, were the
first two cities of this civilisation to be discovered; their
identification goes back to 1924, a century ago. Several sites
followed in the Indus plains, which is why the civilisation
was initially called ‘Indus Valley civilisation’.
Later on, other major cities, such as Dholavira (in Gujarat),
Rakhigarhi (in Haryana), Ganweriwala (in the Cholistan
desert of Pakistan), and hundreds of smaller sites (such

THINK ABOUT IT
You may have come across the term ‘Indus Valley
civilisation’ and noticed that we have not used it. A look at
the map (Fig. 6.3 on page 89) explains why the term ‘Valley’
is obsolete, as we now know that the civilisation extended
much beyond the Indus region.

Fortification:
A massive wall
surrounding a
settlement or
city, generally
for protective
purposes.

The larger Harappan cities were built according to precise
plans. They had wide streets (Fig. 6.4 and 6.5 on page 92),
which were often oriented to the cardinal directions. Most
cities seem to have been surrounded by fortifications and
had two distinct parts — the ‘upper town’, where the local
elite probably lived, and the ‘lower town’, where common
people lived.

Elite: Here, the
word refers
to the higher
layers of the
society, such as
rulers, officials,
administrators,
and often
priests.

Some large buildings seem to have been used for collective
purposes — for instance, warehouses where goods to be
transported were stored. Individual houses of various sizes
lined the streets and smaller lanes. Interestingly, the quality
of construction was the same for small and big houses. All
those buildings were generally made of bricks.
The purpose of some of the structures remains a matter
of debate. This is the case of the famous ‘Great Bath’ in
Mohenjo-daro (Fig. 6.6 on page 93), a small but elaborate
tank which measured about 12 × 7 metres and had
waterproofing materials (such as natural bitumen, a form
of tar) applied on top of carefully laid-out bricks. The tank

as Lothal in Gujarat), were discovered, some of them
excavated. Such discoveries continue even today! It is
interesting to note that the Sarasvatī basin includes not only
two major cities — Rakhigarhi and Ganweriwala — but also
several smaller ones (Farmana in Haryana, Kalibangan in
Rajasthan) and a few towns (Bhirrana and Banawali, both
in Haryana); indeed, the map (Fig. 6.3 on page 89) makes
clear the high density of sites in that region.

was surrounded by small rooms, one of which contained a
well; there was a drain in one corner of the tank to empty it
from time to time and refill it with freshwater.

What was the purpose of such a structure? Archaeologists
have proposed several possible interpretations — a public
bath for people; a bath for the royal family only; or a tank
used for religious rituals. The first interpretation is now
ruled out because it turns out that in this city, most houses
had individual bathrooms.

LET’S EXPLORE
Have a debate in class about the last two interpretations. Can
you think of any others? Remember that in this case, we do not
have any other source of history — no inscription, no text, no
traveller’s account.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond
Tapestry of the Past
The Harappans gave much importance to water management and cleanliness. They often had separate areas for
bathing in their homes; these were connected to a larger
network of drains (Fig. 6.7), which generally ran below the
streets and took the waste water away.

the case of Dholavira (in the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat), the
largest reservoir measured 73 metres in length!

a network of reservoirs. Who do you think organised their
work and gave them precise instructions? How do you think
they were paid for their labour? (Hint: there was no money
at that time in the way we have today.) Since the reservoirs
needed to be cleaned from time to time, was there some
local authority to manage their maintenance? What clues
do we get from all this about this city’s ruler and municipal
administration?
Use your imagination and discuss with your teacher.
Archaeologists also discuss these questions, and the answers
are not always final!

The Harappans created many of their settlements along the
banks of large or small rivers. This is a logical choice, not
just for easy access to water, but also for agriculture, since
rivers enrich the soil around them. Archaeological findings
have shown that the Harappans grew cereals like barley,
wheat, some millets, and sometimes rice, in addition to
pulses and a variety of vegetables. They were also the first
in Eurasia to grow cotton, which they used to weave into
clothes. They made farming tools, including the plough
(Fig. 6.9), some of which continue to be used by modernday farmers.

This intense agricultural activity was managed by hundreds of small rural sites or villages. Then as now, the cities
could survive only if enough agricultural produce from
rural areas reached them on a daily basis.
The Harappans also domesticated a number of animals for
meat consumption and fished both in rivers and in the sea.
This is known from the large numbers of animal and fish
bones found during excavations.
What did Harappan cooking pots contain? Scientific
examinations of clay pots have provided some answers,
both expected ones (dairy products) and surprising ones —
such as remains of turmeric, ginger and banana. Clearly,
their diet was quite diverse!

LET US EXPLORE
Imagine you cook a meal in a Harappan house. What dish or
dishes would you prepare, based on the data given above?

The Harappans were engaged in active trade, not only
within their own civilisation (other cities nearby or far
away), but with other civilisations and cultures within
and outside India. They exported ornaments, timber, some
objects of daily use (Fig. 6.11 on page 98), probably also
gold and cotton, and possibly some food items. The most
favoured ornaments were beads of carnelian (Fig. 6.10 on
page 98), a reddish semiprecious stone found mostly in
Gujarat. Harappan craftspeople developed special techniques to drill them, so a string could pass through them,
and to decorate them in various ways. They also worked
conch shells into beautiful shell bangles, which requires
sophisticated techniques as shell is a hard material.
What the Harappans imported in exchange of the exported
goods is not so clear. It probably included copper, since this
metal was not so common back home.

The Harappans mastered the art of working copper, a soft metal.
If tin is added to copper, the resulting metal is bronze, which is
harder than copper. The Harappans used bronze to make tools,
pots and pans, and, as we will see later, some figurines.

To conduct such a trade, they used

this is the first intensive maritime
activity in India. Indeed, quite a

and 36 metres in width — the length is just a little more than
that of two football grounds! This basin must have been a
dockyard, that is, a structure used to receive and send boats
for further transportation of goods.
Such elaborate trade requires traders to be able to identify
their goods — and also each other! This seems to have
been the chief purpose of thousands of small seals, which
have been excavated from many settlements. These seals

be hardened through heating. They measure only a few

them, a few signs that are part of a writing system. But that
system and the symbolic meaning of the animal figures are
yet to be understood. What is certain is that they somehow
relate to trade activities.

The End or a New Beginning?

Exploring Society: India and Beyond
Tapestry of the Past
Around 1900 BCE, this Sindhu-Sarasvatī civilisation, despite
all its achievements, began to fall apart. The cities were
abandoned one by one. If any inhabitants remained, they
adopted a rural lifestyle in the changed environment — it
appears that the earlier government or administration no
longer existed. Gradually the Harappans scattered over
hundreds, if not thousands, of small rural settlements.

102
THINK ABOUT IT
The Harappans returned to rural settlements because a rural
lifestyle gives easier access to food and water than an urban
lifestyle. Then as now, cities depended on villages to provide
food, and sometimes water.

What caused this decline? Archaeologists have proposed
many factors. Long back, it was thought that warfare or
Reprint 2025-26
chapter6_310125.indd 102
03-02-2025 05:04:59
invasions may have destroyed the cities, but there is no
trace of warfare or invasion. Indeed, the Harappans do not
seem to have kept any army or weapons of war; as far as the
evidence goes, it seems to have been a relatively peaceful
civilisation.
Two factors are currently agreed upon. First, a climatic
change which affected much of the world from 2200 BCE
onward, causing reduced rainfall and a drier phase. This
would have made agriculture more difficult and could have
reduced food supply to the cities. Second, the Sarasvatī
River dried up in its central basin; suddenly, cities there,
such as Kalibangan or Banawali were abandoned. There
could have been other factors, but these two remind us of
how much we depend on climate and the environment for
our well-being.
Although the cities disappeared, much of the Harappan
culture and technology survived and was passed on to the
next phase of Indian civilisation, which we will explore in
a future chapter.

Æ
The Indus, Harappan or Sindhu-Sarasvatī civilisation
is one of the oldest of the world. Its inhabitants, the
Harappans, created planned cities with efficient water
management, diverse crafts and a brisk trade.

Æ
A productive agriculture brought a variety of crops to the
cities.

Æ
The civilisation eventually declined, probably because of
climatic and environmental changes; people returned to a
rural lifestyle.

Indian culture, by any estimate, is several millenniums old.
Like any ancient tree, it has many roots and many branches.
The roots nurture a common trunk. And from the trunk
emerge many branches, which are different manifestations
of Indian culture, yet united by a common trunk.
Some of these branches are about art, literature, science,
medicine, religion, the art of governance, martial arts, and
so on. There are also ‘schools of thought’, by which we mean
groups of thinkers or spiritual seekers who share similar
ideas about human life, the world, etc.
Many archaeologists and scholars have pointed out that
some of India’s cultural roots go all the way to the Indus
or Harappan or Sindhu-Sarasvatī civilisation (which we
visit in Chapter 6). Later on, over time, hundreds of schools
of thought emerged in India. We will see here a few early
schools, which have shaped India into a country with a
unique personality. By understanding them and their roots,
we can understand ‘India, that is Bharat’ better.

The Vedas and Vedic Culture
Exploring Society: India and Beyond
Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions
a. What are the Vedas?
The word “Veda” comes from the Sanskrit vid which
means ‘knowledge’ (hence vidyā, for instance). We briefly
mentioned the Ṛig Veda in earlier chapters. In fact, there
are four Vedas — the Ṛig Veda, the Yajur Veda, the Sāma
Veda and the Atharva Veda. They are the most ancient texts
of India, and indeed among the most ancient in the world.
The Vedas consist of thousands of hymns — prayers in the
form of poems and songs — that were recited orally, not
written. Those hymns were composed in the Sapta Sindhava
region (which we visit in Chapter 5). It is difficult to say
when exactly the Ṛig Veda, the most ancient of the four,
was composed; experts have proposed dates ranging from
106
Reprint 2025-26
chapter7_310125.indd 106
03-02-2025 05:04:34
the 5th to the 2nd millennium BCE. So, for anything between
100 and 200 generations, these texts have been committed
to memory through rigorous training and passed on orally
with hardly any alterations!

DON’T MISS OUT
This meticulous transmission over thousands of years
explains why, in 2008, UNESCO recognised Vedic chanting as ‘a
masterpiece of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity’.

The Vedic hymns were composed by rishis (male seers or
sages) and rishikas (female ones) in an early form of the
Sanskrit language. They were addressed in poetical form
to many deities (gods or goddesses), such as Indra, Agni,
Varuṇa, Mitra, Sarasvatī, Uṣhas, and many more. Together
with the seers, these deities sustained ṛitam, or truth and
order in human life and in the ‘cosmos’.
The early rishis and rishikas saw those gods and goddesses
as one, not separate beings. As one famous hymn puts it,
UNESCO:

In this worldview, some values were especially important,
beginning with ‘Truth’, which was often another name for
God. The last mantras (verses) of the Ṛig Veda also call for
unity among people:
Worldview:
A certain
view or
understanding of
the world, its
origin, or its

b. Vedic society
Early Vedic society was organised in different janas or
‘clans’, that is, larger groups of people. The Ṛig Veda alone
lists over 30 such janas — for instance, the Bharatas, the
Purus, the Kurus, the Yadus, the Turvaśhas etc. Each clan
was associated with a particular region of the northwest
part of the Subcontinent.

Not much is known of how these janas governed their
society. The Vedas only give us a few clues through words
like rājā (a king or ruler), sabhā and samiti, both of which
refer to a collective gathering or assembly.
Many professions are mentioned in the Vedic texts, such
as agriculturist, weaver, potter, builder, carpenter, healer,
dancer, barber, priest, etc.

situation? What could happen if they live under leaders that
they did not choose? (Hint: Think back to what you’re learning
in the theme ‘Governance and Democracy’!) Write your thoughts
in a paragraph of 100–150 words.

c. Vedic schools of thought
A group of texts known as ‘Upaniṣhads’ built upon Vedic
concepts and introduced new ones, such as rebirth (taking
birth again and again) and karma (our actions or their
results). According to one school of thought, generally
known as ‘Vedanta’, everything — human life, nature and
the universe — is one divine essence called brahman (not
to be confused with the god Brahmā) or sometimes just tat
(‘that’). Two well-known mantras express this in a simple
but profound way:
7 ― India’s Cultural Roots
Vedic culture also developed many rituals (yajña, often
read as ‘yagya’) directed towards various deities (gods or

Daily rituals were generally in the form of prayers and

The Upaniṣhads also introduced the concept of ātman or
Self — the divine essence that resides in every being but
is ultimately one with brahman. It follows that everything
in this world is connected and interdependent. This
explains a common prayer that begins with sarve bhavantu
sukhinah, or “May all creatures be happy”, and goes on to
wish them all to be free from disease and sorrow.

Early in the 1st millennium BCE, several more schools of
thought grew out of the Vedas. One of them was Yoga, which
developed methods intended to achieve the realisation
of brahman in one’s consciousness. Together, these schools
of thought became the foundations for what we call
‘Hinduism’ today.

Buddhism
Other schools of thought also emerged, which did not
accept the authority of the Vedas and developed their own
systems. One of them is Buddhism.

named Siddhārtha Gautama was born in Lumbini (today in

Many stories from the Upaniṣhads tell us the importance of
asking questions, whether these questions come from men,
women or children.

Śhvetaketu and the seed of reality
(Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad)
Rishi Uddālaka Āruṇi sent his
son, Śhvetaketu, to a gurukula
to learn the Vedas. When
Śhvetaketu returned 12 years
later, his father realised he
had become very proud of
his learning. So Uddālaka
tested him with questions on
the nature of brahman, which
Śhvetaketu could not answer.
Uddālaka proceeded to explain how brahman, though invisible,
is everywhere, just as the seed of a banyan fruit seems empty
when you open it, but already contains the future banyan tree;
or just as all kinds of different pots can be made out of the same
clay. Similarly, everything around us has emerged from the
same essence — brahman. He concluded his teaching with these
words, “Everything consists of this subtle essence. ... You are
That, Śhvetaketu.”
Once, a man was giving away all his possessions in a ritual. As his
son Nachiketa kept asking him which god he would be offered
to, the father became angry and answered, “I give you to Yama”
— that is, to the god of death.
Nachiketa, then, proceeded to Yama’s world and, after a long
wait, met the mighty god. One question was on his mind — “What

the body?” Yama tried to
avoid answering, but the
boy persisted. Pleased, Yama
explained that the ātman,
or self, is hidden within
all creatures. It is neither
born, nor does it die; it is
immortal. Having acquired
this profound knowledge,
Nachiketa returned to his

The debate of Gārgī and Yājñavalkya
(Bṛihadāraṇyaka Upaniṣhad)
Once, the wise king Janaka announced a prize for the winner
of a philosophical debate. Yājñavalkya, a renowned rishi, came
to the king’s court and defeated many scholars until Gārgī,
a rishika, asked him a series of questions on the nature of
the world, and finally on the
nature of brahman. At that
point, Yājñavalkya asked
her to stop asking further
questions. Later, however,
Gārgī resumed her questions
and Yājñavalkya went on
to explain how brahman
is what makes the world,
the seasons, the rivers and
everything else possible.

come up with widely different conclusions as regards the
precise year of his birth. In Chapter 4, we chose 560 BCE as
an approximate year. In any case, it makes no difference to
our story here.
As the story goes, then, Siddhārtha Gautama grew up living
a protected life in the palace. One day, at the age of 29, he
asked to be driven through the city in a chariot, and for the
first time in his life came across an old man, a sick man, and
a dead body. He also saw an ascetic, who appeared to be
happy and at peace. Following this experience, Siddhārtha
decided to give up his palace life, leaving behind his wife
and son. Travelling on foot as an ascetic, meeting other
ascetics and scholars, he searched for the root cause
of suffering in human life. After meditating for many
days under a pipal tree at Bodh Gaya (today in Bihar), he
attained enlightenment; he realised that avidyā (ignorance)
and attachment are the source of human suffering and
conceived a method to remove these two causes.

The Buddha started teaching
what he had realised, including
the idea of ahimsa, which is
generally translated as ‘nonviolence’, but originally means
‘non-hurting’ or ‘non-injuring’.
He also insisted on a sincere
inner discipline. The following
saying of his expresses this

Jainism
Jainism is another important school
of thought that became widespread
at the same time, although its roots
are said to be much more ancient.
Just like Siddhārtha Gautama, Prince
Vardhamāna was born into a royal
family in the early 6th century BCE.
His birthplace was near the city of
Vaiśhālī, in modern-day Bihar. At
the age of 30, he decided to leave his
home and go in search of spiritual
knowledge. He practised an ascetic
discipline and, after 12 years, achieved
‘infinite knowledge’ or supreme wisdom.
He became known as ‘Mahāvīra’, or
‘great hero’, and started preaching what
he had realised.

A traditional painting of Mahāvīra
The word ‘Jain’ or jaina comes from jina, meaning ‘conqueror’.
This does not refer to the conquest of territory or enemies, but
to the conquest of ignorance and attachments, so as to reach
enlightenment.

Jain teachings include ahimsa, anekāntavāda and
aparigraha. These ideas, shared to a large extent with
Buddhism and the Vedantic school of thought, are central

to Indian culture. The first may be illustrated by this saying
of Mahāvīra:
“All breathing, existing, living, sentient
creatures should not be slain, nor treated
with violence, nor abused, nor tormented,
nor driven away.”
Exploring Society: India and Beyond
Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions
Let us define the last two in simple terms:

Anekāntavāda means ‘not just one’ aspect or
perspective. That is, the truth has many aspects and
cannot be fully described by any single statement.


Aparigraha means ‘non-possession’ and advises
detachment from material possessions, limiting
oneself to what is truly necessary in life.

Jainism also insists on the interconnectedness and
interdependence of all creatures, from humans to invisible
organisms, as they support each other and cannot live
without one another. Scientists studying nature, flora and
fauna, have again and again confirmed this deep truth.

The Jātaka tales, which have delighted generations of Indian
children and adults, tell stories of the Buddha’s former births
and express in simple terms the Buddhist values.
In a well-known tale, the Buddha was the king of a large
troop of monkeys. They lived near a huge tree which bore
fruit of divine fragrance and taste. Despite the monkeyking’s instructions that no fruit should escape, one day a ripe
fruit fell into the stream below. Carried by the current, it was
116

caught in a net and taken to the palace. The king was so enchanted by
its taste that he ordered his soldiers to locate the tree it came from.
After a long search, they found the tree — and the monkeys enjoying
the tree’s fruits. The soldiers attacked
the monkeys. The only way for the
monkey-king to save his monkeys
was to help them cross the stream,
but they could not do so on their own.
Being much larger than them, the
monkey-king caught hold of a tree on
the other bank and let them use his
body as a bridge to cross the stream,
although he was severely bruised in
the process and eventually died.
The king, who watched the scene from
a distance, was greatly moved by the
monkey-king’s selfless sacrifice. He
thought about the role of a king with
respect to his subjects.

Madhya Pradesh) depicting the

Feeling remorseful, Rohineya approached Mahāvīra, confessed his
crimes, returned the stolen treasures, and asked for forgiveness. He
became a monk, realised the illusion he was living in and focused on
acquiring higher knowledge.
The story illustrates the importance of right action and right
thinking, and also illustrates the fact that everyone should have a
second chance.

Rohineya was an extraordinarily skilled burglar who evaded all
attempts to catch him. On his way to a city, he accidentally heard
a few sentences from a sermon that Mahāvīra was giving about
achieving liberation from the ordinary life of ignorance. Reaching
the city, Rohineya was recognised and arrested. He pretended to be
a simple farmer. A minister devised a clever plan to force him to
confess his identity. But Rohineya, remembering Mahāvīra’s words,
was able to detect the minister’s plan and defeat it.

THINK ABOUT IT
118
In both Buddhism and Jainism, ahimsa means much more
than refraining from physical violence against a person or
an animal. It also means refraining from violence in thought,
such as having ill feelings towards anyone. If we observe
ourselves carefully, we may notice such negative thoughts and
learn to turn them into positive ones. Sometimes such negative
thoughts are even directed at ourselves!

In both Buddhism and Jainism, monks, and sometimes
nuns too, began travelling across the land to spread their
respective teachings far and wide. Some of them created
new monasteries in faraway places, while others led ascetic
lives in caves cut in the rock. Archaeological findings have
revealed many traces of those monasteries, sometimes even
the names of the monks who lived in the rock-cut caves and
slept on the stone beds!

Some of the caves are Hindu, others are Buddhist and Jain.

THINK ABOUT IT
There were yet other schools of thought at the time. For
example, one of them, known as the ‘Chārvāka’ school
(sometimes also ‘Lokāyata’), believed that this material
world is the only thing that exists, and therefore there can
be no life after death. This school does not seem to have
gained much popularity and it disappeared with time.
We mention it to show that there was a wide diversity of
intellectual or spiritual belief systems; people were free to
choose what suited them.

7 ― India’s Cultural Roots
In English, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism are often
labelled ‘religions’. You may notice that we have avoided this
term, preferring ‘schools of thought’ and (later in this chapter)
‘belief systems’. This is because there are many aspects to
those schools and systems, which we will explore gradually —
a philosophical aspect, a spiritual aspect, a religious aspect, an
ethical aspect, a social aspect, to name a few. Many scholars
agree that the word ‘religion’ is too limiting in the context of
the Indian civilisation.

Although the Vedic, Buddhist and Jain schools had important
differences, they also shared some common concepts,
such as dharma, karma, rebirth, the search for an end to
suffering and ignorance, and many important values. This
is the ‘trunk’ of the tree we started this chapter with.

Folk and Tribal Roots
The cultural roots we have seen so far are well documented
in many texts. India has also had rich ‘oral traditions’, that
is, teachings or practices transmitted through everyday
practice, without written texts (this is the case of the
Vedas). Among them are numerous folk traditions, that
is, transmitted by common people, and tribal traditions,
transmitted by tribes.

What is a tribe?

Exploring Society: India and Beyond
Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions
There are many definitions for this social entity. Today,
anthropologists usually consider a tribe to be a group of
families or clans sharing a tradition of common descent, a
culture and a language, living as a close-knit community
under a chief and holding no private property.

120
Interestingly, ancient India did not have a word for ‘tribe’
— tribes were just different janas that lived in a specific
environment, such as forests or mountains. The Constitution
of India uses the terms ‘tribes’ and ‘tribal communities’ in
English, and janjāti in Hindi.
According to official figures, in 2011 India had 705 tribes
spread over most States, amounting to a population of about
104 million people — more than the populations of Australia
and the United Kingdom together!
In the 19th century, anthropologists studying tribes often
described them as ‘primitive’ or ‘inferior’ to civilised people.
With deeper studies of tribal communities and their rich and
complex cultures, such biased judgments have been mostly
abandoned.

How have such interactions taken place for so
long and so naturally? It is, in the end, because
folk, tribal and Hindu belief systems have
many similar concepts. For instance, in all
three, elements of nature such as mountains,
rivers, trees, plants and animals, and some
stones too, are regarded as sacred, because
there is consciousness behind all of them.
Indeed, tribes generally worship many deities
associated with those natural elements. For the
Toda tribals of the Nilgiris of Tamil Nadu, for
instance (one of them is pictured in the image on the right),
over thirty peaks of this mountain range are residences of
a god or a goddess; those peaks are so sacred that the Todas
avoid pointing to them with a finger.
But despite this multiplicity of deities, as with Hinduism,
many tribal groups have a concept of a higher divinity or
supreme being. For example, several tribes of Arunachal
Pradesh worship Donyipolo, a combined form of the Sun and
7 ― India’s Cultural Roots
There has been a constant interaction
between folk and tribal traditions, and
the leading schools of thought such as
those we mentioned in this chapter.
Deities, concepts, legends and rituals
have been freely exchanged in both
directions. For instance, according to
tradition, Jagannath, worshipped at Puri
(Odisha), was originally a tribal deity;
this is also the case with various forms of
the mother-goddess worshipped across
India. Some tribes, on the other hand,
adopted Hindu deities long ago, and possess their own
versions of the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa — this has
been well documented from India’s northeastern States, all
the way to Tamil Nadu.

the Moon who later rose to the higher status of a supreme god.
This is also the case of the god Khandoba in parts of central
India. In eastern India, the Munda and Santhal tribals, among
others, worship Singbonga, a supreme deity who created this
whole world. There are many more such examples.
The Indian sociologist André Béteille summed up this
situation in these words:
“The thousands of castes and tribes on the Indian
subcontinent have influenced each other in their
religious beliefs and practices since the beginning of
history and before. That the tribal religions have been
influenced by Hinduism is widely accepted, but it is
equally true that Hinduism, not only in its formative
phase but throughout its evolution, has been influenced
by tribal religions.”
Clearly, the result of this long interaction has been mutual
enrichment. In this manner, folk and tribal beliefs and
practices also count among India’s cultural roots. We will
further develop this point in the next chapter.

If you travel through India by train, you will notice not
only changing landscapes but also many different types of
dresses and food; you will hear different languages, familiar
and unfamiliar, and see different scripts on the way. Even
within your own region, you will often come across people
from other parts of India with different customs and
traditions. This is India’s rich diversity, and it is usually the
first thing that strikes visitors to our country.
With over 1.4 billion inhabitants (about 18 percent of the
world’s population), such diversity is not surprising! In the
late 20th century, the Anthropological Survey of India, a
national organisation, conducted a massive survey called
‘People of India project’ of 4,635 communities across all
States of the country. It counted 325 languages using 25
scripts; it also observed that many Indians may be called
migrants, in the sense of people not living near their
birthplace or with their original community.

Every region and community in

silk, but nowadays synthetic fabrics
too. Banarasi, Kanjivaram, Paithani,

are many more kinds of cotton saris.

designs are part of the cloth,
while others are printed after
the cloth is woven. Finally,
there are endless variations
in the colours, which are
produced from many kinds
of pigments.

diversity (in 100-150 words).

One beautiful type of printed cotton called ‘chintz’ became so
popular in 17th-century Europe that the sale of some European
dresses dropped sharply. Eventually, to protect their own
products, England and France decided to ban the import of
chintz from India!

There are many ways of wearing the sari, as they vary from

An Epic Spread
The most striking case, however, is that of India’s two epics
— the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata.
These two long Sanskrit poems, which together might fill
some 7,000 pages in their original versions, narrate the
stories of heroes who fight to re-establish dharma. In the
Mahābhārata, the Pāṇḍavas, with Kṛiṣhṇa’s help, fight
their own cousins, the Kauravas, to recover their kingdom.
In the Rāmāyaṇa, Rāma, with the help of his brother
Lakṣhmaṇa and of Hanuman, defeats the demon Rāvaṇa,
who had kidnapped his wife Sītā. These stories contain
many shorter ones that focus on values, and constantly
ask questions about what is right and what is wrong.

8 – Unity in Diversity, or ‘Many in the One’
Literature offers us another fine illustration of unity in
diversity. Indian literatures are extremely diverse (and
among the most abundant in the world). Over centuries,
despite differences in language, technique, etc., they have
shared important themes and concerns. Who has not
heard of the Pañchatantra, for example? This collection
of delightful stories, with animals as the main characters,
teaches us important life skills. The original Sanskrit text is
at least 2,200 years old, but its stories have been adapted in
almost every Indian language. In fact, they have travelled
well beyond India, all the way to Southeast Asia, the Arab
world and Europe, inspiring new collections of stories on
the way — it is estimated that about 200 adaptations of
the Pañchatantra exist in more than 50 languages! This
illustrates how ‘one’ collection of stories has become ‘many’.

For more than two millenniums, these two epics have been
translated or adapted into regional literatures in India
and beyond. In addition, there are countless folk versions
of them. A few years ago, a scholar conducted a survey in
Tamil Nadu alone and counted “about a hundred versions
[of the Mahābhārata] that have come down to us in folklore
forms.” Imagine what the number might be for the whole
of India!
In fact, many communities have their own versions of the
Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata. They have also preserved
legends connecting their own history with these epics. This
is especially true of tribal communities in many parts of

The anthropologist K.S. Singh directed
the ‘People of India’ project we referred
to earlier (see page 126). In the case of
the Mahābhārata, he observed, “There
is hardly a place in the country which
the epic heroes such as the Pandavas, did not visit according
to folklores.” And the same may be said of the Rāmāyaṇa.
Over the centuries, perhaps more than any other texts,
these two epics created a dense web of cultural interactions
across India and many parts of Asia. Another example of
unity in diversity.
To further illustrate the theme of this chapter, we could
have continued our journey and turned to more facets
of Indian culture. For instance, in India’s classical arts,
including classical architecture, both diversity and unity
are easily noticeable. (You will study these fields through
the Art Curricular Area.)
In the end, we should remember that Indian culture
celebrates diversity as an enrichment, but never loses sight
of the underlying unity which nourishes that diversity.

India, such as the Bhils, the Gonds, the
Mundas and many more. Most tribes
of India’s northeast and Himalayan
regions, including Kashmir, have
had their own version of one or the
other of the two epics, or both. These
tribal adaptations are transmitted
orally, along with legends on how
the heroes of the Rāmāyaṇa and the
Mahābhārata (generally any or all of
the five Pāṇḍavas, their wife Draupadī,
but also sometimes their cousin and
adversary Duryodhana) visited the

Family
9 ― Family and Community
Almost all of us live in a family. The family is the fundamental
and most ancient unit of any society. In Indian society today,
there are several types of families — from joint families
to nuclear families. A joint family has several generations
living together — grandparents, parents, uncles and aunts,

In English, there are not many terms to describe family
relationships; we saw some of them in the first paragraph.
Indian languages have many more terms. For example,
in Hindi there is bua, tau, tai, chacha, mausi, nana, nani,
and many more. Some languages, such as Tamil, also have
different terms for elder brother / sister or younger brother
/ sister. But what is the word for ‘cousin’ in an Indian
language? In most Indian languages, you will find that there
is no such word! That is because cousins are only ‘brothers’
and ‘sisters’. This emphasises the deep bonds among all the
children in the family.

mother tongue or regional language and try to find the
equivalent in English. Two examples are below for Hindi:

meanings)

Notice how, quite often, a single word in your mother
tongue or regional language requires several words in
English to give a precise definition.

Relationships among family members are based on love,
care, cooperation and interdependence. ‘Cooperation’
means ‘working together’. Each member of the family
has a role and responsibility towards other members. For
instance, parents are responsible for raising their children
to become happy individuals and responsible members of
the society. But also, as children grow up, they take on more
responsibilities in the home to help other family members
— whether parents or a sister or a brother, etc. Through
daily practice, children learn to participate in the life of the
household. In many homes, children also learn some of the
traditions and practices their family has been following for
generations.

Following our dharma, or doing our duty, has been an
important principle of Indian culture. The family is also
a ‘school’, where children learn important values such as
ahimsa, dāna (giving), sevā (service) and tyāga (sacrifice).
Individuals in the family often give up their own needs to
take care of the family’s needs.

and her Chitti (aunt or uncle’s wife) live with them. They have a
daughter, Shalini’s cousin, who she calls Chinni. Shalini’s uncle
has just lost his job and her aunt is a homemaker. The whole
family was preparing for the festival of Onam. Acchamma told
Shalini’s father that his brother was having financial difficulties,
so they were not able to buy new
clothes for the festival. When Shalini’s
parents took her and her brother
shopping, they bought new clothes
not only for themselves, but also for
Chittappa, Chitti and Chinni. As a
result, Shalini did not get the silk dress
she had expected; she had to settle
for a simple cotton one. Acchamma
explained to Shalini that this is how
families support each other and share
what they have. Shalini did not mind
her simpler dress. She was happy that
everyone could get some new clothes.

Families are connected not only within themselves, but
also with other families and the people around them. Such
a group of connected people may be called a ‘community’
(there are other meanings for ‘community’, depending on
the context). Members of a community come together for
various reasons, like celebrating festivals and organising
feasts, weddings and other events. In some villages, people
come together to support each other with agricultural
practices like land preparation, sowing and harvesting.
Over time, communities often agreed upon some practices
on the use of shared natural wealth and resources such
as water, grazing lands and forest produce. This is the case
with many tribal communities. To some extent, this remains
the case in village communities in rural India today. Such
practices — we may call them ‘rules’, though they were
rarely written down — have provided communities a secure
access to resources. But it also means that all families and

Year after year, the region around the town of Jhabua,

Following their halma (see facing page) tradition of coming
together to support any individual or family in times of
crisis, the Bhil community decided to plant thousands of
trees in hundreds of villages. The Bhils also dug many
trenches to conserve rainwater and created other water
harvesting structures. They did not get paid for this work
but did it as their duty towards their community and
the environment. In the halma tradition, the objective is
to serve Mother Earth. In 2019, Shri Mahesh Sharma of

Some had dropped out of school, while others had never
been to school. Kamal started giving them tuition from 5:30

A few teachers from a local school noticed the classes and
joined the teaching for a while. One of them observed, “These

noise, yet they pay all their attention to what the teachers
tell them. This touched my heart. The love and affection I
got from them was unbelievable.” Some older children who
were attending regular schools also joined as volunteers to
teach in Kamal’s classes. One of them remarked, “We went
there to teach, instead we learnt a lot from them.”

New types of communities have also emerged in the last 30

areas are examples of communities that make their own
rules and regulations. Those could be rules about waste
management, cleanliness of common areas, taking care of
pets, and so on. People living in the community participate
in making such rules and regulations.
Communities are ultimately interdependent. The same
Residents’ Welfare Associations, for instance, will depend
on the trading community for supplies and also on municipal
workers to handle waste. In our complex societies, everyone
depends on a number of other people and communities.

Introduction
Human beings have been living in communities for a long
time. When a large number of people live together, there
can be disagreements and disorder, and rules become
necessary to maintain order and harmony in the society.
There are probably some simple rules at home that you are
expected to follow. The school where you study has rules too
— some for students, others for teachers. In higher classes,
students appearing for examinations must follow certain
rules. Drivers on the road are expected to obey traffic rules.
People employed in all kinds of jobs also need to follow the
rules set by their employer, while the employers must also
follow rules which they have committed to their employees.
What would happen if no one followed those rules? A
simple answer is that society would not be able to function.

followed, is called governance. The group of individuals
or the system that makes the rules and ensures that they
are followed is called a government. Some of the more
important rules are called laws.
This does not mean that rules and laws are set once and for
all. Just as you might discuss a particular rule at home with

Three Organs of Government
However, this has also created a new class of criminals
who, without even leaving their desks, find digital ways of
stealing people’s money. This has led many governments
to pass new laws in order to fight such criminal activities
(called ‘cybercrime’). Some of those criminals, who believe
in robbing innocent people of their hard-earned money
instead of using their skills to contribute to the society,
have been arrested and convicted in court. They are usually
fined as well as jailed for some years.
Through this example, we can see how the three branches
or ‘organs’ of a government work together:

The legislature is the organ that makes new laws (or
‘legislates’). Sometimes it also updates or removes

All over the world, digital technologies have been
transforming the way societies function. In India, till about
30 years ago, people who wanted to transfer money to a
distant relative would have to queue up at the Post Office to
send a money order after filling up a form; or if they had to

existing laws. This is done by an assembly of representatives of the people. We will soon see how the Indian
system works.
The executive is the organ that implements (or
‘executes’) the laws. This includes the head of state
(who may be a president, a prime minister or a chief
minister), the ministers and any agency responsible for
enforcing ‘law and order’. (In our example above, that
agency is the cyber police.)
The judiciary is the system of courts which decides
whether someone has broken the law and, if so, what
course of action should be taken, including punishment
if necessary. Sometimes it also examines whether a
decision taken by the executive is right, or whether a
law passed by the legislature is well conceived and fair
to all.

LET’S EXPLORE
Explain how the three government organs are at work in
the case of the cybercriminals described above. How do they

In a good system of governance,
these three organs must be
kept separate, although they
interact with each other
and work together. This
separation is called the
Governance
‘separation of powers’
(Fig. 10.3). It is intended
to provide a system of
Executive
checks and balances. This
means that each organ of the
government can check what the

other is doing and restore balance if
one organ acts beyond its expected role.

As a class activity, can you imagine the sort of disorder we
might witness if all three organs were under the control of
the same group of people? Can you describe any such real-life
situation you may have heard of?

Three Levels of Government
Any government operates at two levels at the least —
local and national. In many countries, including India, it
functions at three levels or tiers — local, state or regional,
and national. Each level deals with different matters. To
use a comparison, if a bulb in your home is not lighting up,
you will first check the bulb, switch, fuse, etc. If that does
not work, you may call an electrician, and if it is found that
the problem is not within your home, you may need to go
to the Electricity Board and file a complaint. These are also
three levels of dealing with a problem.

In India, we have local governments, State governments,
and Central or Union government (Fig. 10.4 on page 155).
Imagine that following heavy rain for a few days, there is a
flood in a part of a district. If it is not too severe, the local
authorities may be able to deal with it. If it involves several
towns and many villages, the State Government will step in
and send rescue teams to help affected people. But if it’s a
massive flood affecting vast areas, the Central Government
may also come to help by sending relief supplies, the army,
etc. These are the three levels again.

DON’T MISS OUT
Many of our institutions have mottos inspired by the wisdom
of our ancient texts. The Government of India’s motto, for
example, is Satyameva Jayate, which means “Truth alone
triumphs”. The Supreme Court’s motto is Yato Dharmastato
Jayah, or, “Where there is dharma, there is victory.”

Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam
Born in a humble family in Rameswaram, Tamil
Nadu, in 1931, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was a
renowned scientist, nicknamed the ‘Missile Man
of India’ for his crucial role in the development
of India’s space programme, missile programme
and nuclear capabilities.
Dr. Abdul Kalam served as the 11th President
of India from 2002 to 2007. Despite his high
status, he remained deeply connected to the
people, and the youth in particular, through his passion for good
education and innovation. He inspired millions with his humility,
dedication to social causes and commitment to the nation. He
tirelessly encouraged young Indians to dream big and work hard
to achieve their goals.
Dr. Kalam showed that even though his position as the President
of India was nominal, he could play an important role, impacting
countless lives.

Democracy
You may have noticed that we earlier mentioned
‘representatives of the people’. This is one of the foundation
stones of the system of governance adopted by most countries
of the world — democracy. The word ‘democracy’ comes
from two Greek words — dēmos meaning ‘people’, and
kratos meaning ‘rule’ or ‘power’; so ‘democracy’ literally
means the ‘rule of the people’.

It is the same principle at the State or national levels ̶
through elections, people vote for representatives, who will
be the elected members of their respective assemblies. They
are generally called ‘Members of Legislative Assembly’
(or MLAs) at the State level, and ‘Member of Parliament’
(or MPs) at the national level.
All these members discuss laws,
problems and solutions in the
assemblies, and, through dialogue
and debate, try to convince each
other whenever there are different
opinions.
Like any modern democracy,
therefore, India is a representative
democracy. It is also the world’s
10 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 1
But can all people actually rule? It is clearly not possible.
Imagine there is a problem that your class wants to bring
to the attention of your school’s principal — maybe there is
something wrong with the classroom, or with the school’s
infrastructure, or perhaps you would like to propose a
certain date for a field trip. Will the entire class go to the
principal? It would clearly not be practical. In many schools,
classes have a ‘class monitor’ or ‘class representative’,
whom the whole class elected; even if there is none, one
representative can be selected for this specific purpose. It
will be enough to send the representative to the principal.

largest democracy, with some 970 million voters in 2024!
In principle, all Indian citizens above the age of 18 have the
right to participate in these elections.
Imagine that your class is planning to go for a picnic. There
are two possible places, A and B. The class discusses the
pros and cons — distance, time, cost, availability of basic
facilities, etc. It becomes difficult to arrive at a decision.
So your teacher decides that voting can solve the problem.
The number of students in favour of place A raise their
hands, then the number of students in favour of place B
raise theirs. The decision is taken by whichever option gets
a larger number of raised hands. (This process is called
voting.) This is a case of direct democracy where every
student’s opinion was taken to finalise the place.
The term grassroots democracy refers to a system that
enables and encourages the participation of ordinary
citizens — the base of the pyramid we saw in Fig. 10.4 on
page 155. In such a system, the citizens can have a say in
decisions which affect them.
We will study more features of Indian democracy in the
next two chapters and also in later grades.

Let us now see how the government functions at the local
level. In this chapter, our focus will be on local government in
rural areas; we will move to urban areas in the next chapter.

Let us take a trip to Lakshmanpur, a small village in the
foothills of the Himalayas. It has 200 houses and a population
of about 700, most of whom are farmers. People cultivate
11 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 2
India is a country of enormous size and diversity. We have
about 600,000 villages, 8,000 towns and over 4,000 cities.
Our population has crossed 1.4 billion, almost two-thirds of
which live in rural areas. How do we govern ourselves in this
complex society?

their lands and rear cows or goats. Some have relatives
serving in the armed forces; a few younger villagers have
migrated to the city in search of jobs. What are the needs
of this village — maybe water for the fields, repairing the
main road if it got damaged by heavy rains, or maintaining
the village’s primary school? How will the villagers take
decisions about such matters that affect their daily lives?
And where will they get the resources to meet those needs?
What will happen if there is a dispute about land or if some
of the crop is stolen? Many such questions can arise in a
village. Can people run to the State or the national capital
for every such issue?

Panchayati Raj System
Like every village in India, the Lakshmanpur people have
a system of local government called ‘Panchayat’, which
refers to a village council. Panchayats bring governance
closer to the people, making it possible for them to actively
participate in decision-making processes. That is why
the Panchayat system, also known as Panchayati Raj, is
a form of self-government. Panchayats play a vital role
in addressing local issues, promoting development and
ensuring that the benefits of government schemes reach
the grassroots level.

As is clear from the diagram, the Panchayati Raj system
works at three levels — from bottom up — the village, the
block and the district. This is called a ‘three-tier system’.
Together, these institutions’ responsibilities cover almost
all aspects of life in the district, from agriculture, housing,
maintenance of roads, management of water resources,
education, health care and social welfare to cultural
activities.

Gram Panchayat
11 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 2
Let us begin with the base of Fig. 11.1 on page 164 — the Gram
Panchayat, which is closest to the people in rural areas. Its
members are elected directly by the Gram Sabha, which is
a group of adults from a village (or group of neighbouring
villages) who are enrolled as voters. In the Gram Sabha,
women and men discuss all matters related to their area
and take decisions. Each Gram Panchayat elects a head
or president called the ‘Sarpanch’ or ‘Pradhan’. In recent
years, more and more women have become Sarpanchs.

that is, ‘Service to the village is service to
the public.’ Kamble defeated six other
candidates to become the Sarpanch.

Anna Hazare’s model of rainwater harvesting, watershed conservation
and massive tree planting of lakhs of trees, all of which contributed to
the recharge of groundwater. With the collaboration of the villagers,
Hiware Bazar became a green and prosperous village in a few years.
Shri Popatrao Pawar was awarded the Padma Shri in 2020.

The Gram Panchayat is assisted by a
Panchayat Secretary who performs
administrative functions such as
calling meetings and maintaining
records. Most Gram Panchayats are
also assisted by an officer called
‘Patwari’ in many parts of India, who
maintains the villagers’ land records.
In some cases, the Patwari keeps
maps that are generations old!

THINK ABOUT IT
How do you think can these old maps be helpful for us?
Can they tell us something about the past and the present?

Child-Friendly Panchayat Initiative
In Maharashtra, for example, a few Bal Panchayats have
worked to eliminate child labour and child marriage.
They have brought many children back to school. The Bal
Panchayat members get together to convince parents and
other adults to send their wards back to school, and not to
arrange marriages for girls who should be studying.
Several Gram Panchayats have won awards for taking
child-friendly initiatives. Here’s an example from Sikkim:
Sangkhu Radhu Khandu Gram Panchayat, in west Sikkim,
has given a lot of importance to children’s needs and rights.

11 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 2
Panchayats are supposed to listen to everyone’s voice
— including the voice of children. The Child-Friendly
Panchayat Initiative creates opportunities for children to
express their ideas and opinions on matters that concern
their wellbeing. Steps are being taken in several States to
encourage the participation of children in Bal Sabhas and
Bal Panchayats on a regular basis, while village elders try
to find solutions to their concerns.

The Panchayat has built compound walls for schools to
make them safer for children. To ensure that students get
hygienically cooked midday meals, the Gram Panchayat has
constructed kitchens in the schools. It is for these efforts
that Sangkhu Radhu Khandu has been declared a childfriendly Gram Panchayat.
Let us also look at another example from Rajasthan:
Exploring Society: India and Beyond
Governance and Democracy
The ‘Children’s Parliament’, an offshoot of Bunker Roy’s
‘Barefoot College’ initiative a few decades ago, empowered
underprivileged children in Rajasthan’s rural areas
through education and democratic participation. Children
aged 8 to 14 are engaged in governance processes, learning
about democracy and social responsibility through night
schools and parliament-like elections. The ‘Parliament’
followed formal procedures, including voter ID cards
and campaigning. Elected representatives formed a
‘Cabinet’, overseeing school management and advocating
for community needs. The initiative fostered leadership
skills and social awareness, enabling children to challenge
societal norms and advocate for change. Children actively
addressed issues such as access to education, sanitation and

Children’s Parliament initiative received many accolades,
including the World’s Children’s Honorary Award in 2001.

LET’S EXPLORE
As a class activity, let four or five students form a Bal Panchayat
and the rest of the class imagine they are the villagers. What
issues will the Gram Sabha discuss? What challenges could it
encounter? What solutions will it propose?

Panchayat Samiti and Zila Parishad
The composition of the Panchayat Samitis differs from State
to State, but their role in strengthening the participation
of local people remains the same. They coordinate matters
across Gram Panchayats, for instance, by collecting
development plans from all Gram Panchayats and putting
them together to present them at the District or State levels
respectively. This facilitates the allotment of funds for such
development projects and for government schemes such as
the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, which promotes
the construction of all-weather roads in rural areas.
At all the three levels, special rules have been made so that
disadvantaged sections of the population can make their
needs and problems heard. These institutions also have a
provision for reserving one-third of the seats for women.

11 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 2
Similar institutions exist at the block level and the district
level, which are above the village level. Their names are
listed in the pyramidal diagram we saw in Fig. 11.1 on page
164. The Panchayat Samiti at the block level is the link
between the Gram Panchayat and the Zila Parishad at the
district level. The members of these institutions are elected
by the local people, but they may have other members like
Sarpanchs of the villages in the area and local members of
the State Legislative Assembly.

Governance and Democracy
Let us remember that the structure and functions of
the Panchayati Raj institutions differ a little across
States. This is because the States have authority over
those institutions. But their objectives are the same
— it is to enable villagers to take an active part in the
management and development of their villages and
the local area.

The Arthaśhāstra is an ancient text of governance written
by Kauṭilya (later also known as Chāṇakya) some 2,300
years ago. Among other things, it describes how a state
should be structured and run, how the economy can be
made prosperous, what the duties of the ruler are and
how to conduct war. Kauṭilya, an expert in statecraft, also
explains how a whole administrative structure should be
put in place from the village to the regional capital:

quarters) for every 10 villages; a kārvaṭika (district headquarters)
for every 100 villages; a droṇamukha for every 400 villages; and
a sthānīya (provincial headquarters) for every 800 villages.”
In today’s language, what are the names we would give these
four categories? Is it not amazing that a similar structure was
thought of so long ago?

Introduction
Earlier chapters have shown us how,
in a democracy, good governance
aims to empower the citizens so they
may actively participate in their
country’s functioning, whether it is
at the rural, regional, urban, state
or national level. This is the broader
concept of participatory democracy.
We saw the basics of the system in
a rural context. Let us now see how
it works in an urban scenario. Since
the latter is generally more complex
and diverse than the former, it is understandable that the
urban governance system needs to be more complex too.
We will however limit ourselves here to its basic principles.

With your classmates, make a list of diverse communities

Before we explore governance and administration in

system of governance, from rural to national, as depicted in
Fig. 12.2 on page 175. The base of the pyramid is the local
level, closer to the people, while the top is the national level.

Urban Local Bodies
Local government structures in urban areas are called
‘urban local bodies’. They are decentralised, which means
that instead of operating under a central authority at the

top, the local communities have a direct say on how their
areas are managed or the issues they face. It is a mechanism
for citizens living in an area to come together and take
decisions about what is best for them.

Exploring Society: India and Beyond
Governance and Democracy
Cities and towns are divided into smaller units called
‘wards’, and the ward committees facilitate activities
such as conducting health camps, organising a campaign
against the use of single-use plastics, and so on. They also
keep an eye on anything that might go wrong — a water
leak, a blocked drain, a damaged road, etc. — and report
such problems to the authorities. However, the precise
functioning of wards differs from State to State, depending
on the rules they make.

176
Altogether, urban local bodies are responsible for a range
of functions — helping take care of the infrastructure,
maintaining the burial ground, garbage collection and
disposal, checking the implementation of government
schemes, collecting local taxes and fines, and so on. They
also have some role in planning for the area’s economic
and social development. However, for these bodies to be
Reprint 2025-26
chapter12.indd 176
03-02-2025 05:03:06
able to perform their functions efficiently, people living in
the city must also perform their duties, which means that
they must show care and concern for their area (remember,
this is a participatory democracy). For instance, if people
carefully follow instructions regarding waste segregation,
garbage collection becomes easier; or if they notice a water
leakage in a street, reporting it promptly will prevent
further wastage of precious water.

Fig. 12.3. The Madras Corporation
The Madras Corporation (now Greater Chennai Corporation),
established on 29 September 1688, is the oldest municipal
institution in India. The East India Company issued a charter
the previous year constituting the town of ‘Fort St. George’ and
all territories within 16 km from the Fort into a corporation. A
Parliamentary Act of 1792 gave the Madras Corporation power
to levy municipal taxes in the city, which is when the municipal
administration properly began.

THINK ABOUT IT
Indore in Madhya Pradesh has been awarded the cleanest
city in India under the Swachh Survekshan government
scheme for seven years in a row. What could have been the
role of Indore citizens in this achievement?

As we see, Chennai and Indore have a Municipal Corporation at the top of their urban bodies. Only cities with a
population above 10 lakhs have a Municipal Corporation
(also called ‘Mahanagar Nigam’) as their highest body.
Between 1 and 10 lakhs, the highest body is a Municipal
Council (also called ‘Nagar Palika’). Cities and towns with
smaller populations have a Nagar Panchayat.

Æ
Select a few cities, from your State and from a few
neighbouring States. These may include the city you
live in or the city nearest to your town or village. How will
you find out if they have a Nagar Panchayat, Municipal
Council or Municipal Corporation? Draw a table with the
names of the cities and the type of urban local body each
of them has.

Æ
How do urban local bodies fund their activities? (Hint:
Look carefully at the pictures of the functions performed by
Indore Municipal Corporation in Figure 12.4 on page 178.)
Are some of them paid services?

Sameer: Hello! I haven’t seen you

There are so many people rushing around all the time, and it’s
noisy compared to the quietness here. Also, people are more
independent and often don’t even know their neighbours.
Sameer: Wow! Here, everyone knows everyone else and
pitches in to help each other out — we work together in the
fields, celebrate festivals together, and even make decisions as
a community.
Anita: Well, there’s still some sense of
community in the city. Just the other
day, following heavy rains, a house
collapsed two streets away. Dozens of
people gathered from all over the place
to help clear the rubble and make sure
no one was trapped inside.
Sameer: Doesn’t the local government
help in such cases?
Anita: Yes, it does. In fact, we have
local bodies and elected representatives who represent us and
our interests.
Sameer: Well, it sounds like our village Panchayat, only bigger.
Members are elected, too, but because they all know each other,
a lot more people can participate and discuss all kinds of issues
that concern the village. Sometimes, even us kids can get heard.

electricity wire was hanging dangerously low, almost touching
the roof of a building. Not only did we report it, but we explained
to one of our Gram Sabha members that an electric post should
be shifted a little. And it was done!
Anita: Great! I suppose that’s how democracy should work. It
seems more complicated in the city, but the idea is the same —
everyone’s voice matters.
Sameer: Yes, it does! Sorry, I must make a move. My mother needs
my help for a little shopping. Thanks for telling me about the city.

In urban areas, decentralised governance works
through different urban local bodies, which fulfil
various functions affecting the citizens’ lives.

→
As with the rural context, urban local bodies have elected
members who represent the local citizens.

→
The citizens also have duties to ensure that the local bodies
are able to perform their functions efficiently.

Character in the
story
Activities they
are engaged in
Economic activities are those that involve money or are
performed in exchange for money or money’s worth for the
parties involved. For example, a business person selling
school bags in the market, a farmer selling produce in
the market, a lawyer arguing a case and earning a fee, a
truck driver transporting goods from one place to another,
workers employed in a car manufacturing factory, etc.
Market: A place where people engage
in the exchange of goods and services.
People may exchange goods and
services for other goods but in most
markets these are exchanged for money.

Fee: A payment made to a
person or organisation in
exchange for professional advice
or services. For example, a fee
paid to a doctor and a lawyer.

Money’s
worth: The
monetary
value that
a person
places on
an object

they derive
from it.

Kavya was excited to go to her aunt’s house in the village of
Kamlapur. On the way, she saw that a highway was being
built near the village, and the construction site was abuzz
with activity. Large machines, such as excavators and
bulldozers, were being operated by dedicated technicians.

This new highway promised to reduce
the travel time to the nearest town
from five hours to just two hours.
Kavya thought that she would be able
to visit her aunt more often once the
highway was ready, since it would
take less time to travel there. Happy
with this thought, Kavya ran to greet
her aunt and to eat the delicious
jalebis that she had made. They were
joined by Kavya’s uncle, who had
just returned home from work. He
is a technician in a construction company and operates a
bulldozer. He receives a monthly salary for his services.

On the weekend, Kavya visited a local
mango orchard with her aunt to have some
delicious mangoes.

THINK ABOUT IT
On your way from home to school today, can you recall the
various economic activities that people are engaged in? In
what ways do you think those people are paid?

As we now understand, economic activities are those that
have value in terms of money. Economic activities also add
value at each stage of the process of transforming something into another form. This is called value addition.

Wage:
A payment
made by the
employer
to the
worker for
a specific
period of
time.
Payment
in kind: A
non-cash
payment
that is
received for
the work
performed.

Rajesh sells a chair for ₹1,000

The wood for the chair costs ₹600. So, what is the remaining
₹400 (₹1,000 – ₹600) for? It is the monetary value of Rajesh’s
skill, time and effort, which went into making that chair.
Rajesh has added value to the wood by turning it into
furniture. From buying the wood to selling the chair, these
activities involve payment. They are, therefore, a part of
economic activities.

increased tremendously. For example, earlier most people
were involved in activities such as agriculture, livestock
rearing, production of tools, pottery and weaving cloth.
As societies progressed, the number of economic activities
through which people earn their livelihoods increased
vastly.
Today, there are diverse economic activities such as
manufacturing computers, mobile phones and drones;
working in banks, schools and hotels; driving various types
of vehicles for transportation; making furniture; tailoring
clothes using machines; creating software; repairing
refrigerators and washing machines; etc. Classifying all
these activities helps us to understand how they function

Economic activities in which people are dependent on
outputs of the primary sector and transform them to
produce goods are known as secondary activities or
secondary sector economic activities. The secondary sector
includes the construction of buildings, roads, etc., and
providing utilities like water, electricity, gas and other such
necessities. It also includes the manufacturing of products
in factories and production units to process raw material
from the primary sector into some other form that can be
further sold or consumed. Some examples of secondary
sector activities include the processing of grains obtained
from agricultural fields to make flour in mills, extraction of
oil from groundnut and processing of tea leaves to derive
tea. Similarly, wood from the forest is converted into
furniture and paper, cotton is used to make clothes, and
steel from iron ore is used to make automobiles like cars,
trucks, etc.

which still play a very important role. For example, the
driver of a truck transports grains and vegetables from the
farm to a factory or the market.

Interdependence Among Sectors
The three types of economic activities or economic sectors
play an important role in the process of conversion of
natural raw materials into finished products for final
consumption. Let us go on an imaginary excursion to a
village in Anand district of Gujarat to study an interesting
example where we will understand how the three sectors
are interconnected and support each other.

Dairy cooperative: from farm to plate
Dairy:
A place
where
milk is
collected
and
stored.

These days, farmers in Gujarat greet the day with the
clinking of milk pails and the happy moos of their best
friends, their cows or buffaloes! Cows have a special place
in the lives of the farmers and their families. The farmers
milk the cows and sell their milk to the dairy nearby. At the
end of the month, they get paid for the milk based on its
quantity and quality. However, this was not the case about
50 years ago.
This is the amazing story of a milk cooperative named Anand
Milk Union Limited (AMUL). In the early 1940s, farmers in
Anand district would sell milk to the neighbouring villages.

One day, the farmers collectively
approached Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,
a prominent national leader, with their
problems. He advised them to form a
cooperative to become independent
and stop relying on the middlemen. As
Sardar Vallabhbhai
Patel
a cooperative, the farmers would be able to buy
and sell
milk as a group, taking care of the entire operation of milk
collection, processing and distribution themselves. The
farmers took Sardar Patel’s advice.
AMUL was set up in 1946 under the leadership of
Tribhuvandas Patel (lawyer and freedom fighter) and Dr.
Varghese Kurien (an engineer who was working at a dairy
factory in Mumbai).

Cooperative:
A group of
people who
voluntarily
come
together to
meet their
economic
and social
needs in a
formal way.
They own the
cooperative
and decisions
are taken by
the members
collectively.

Middlemen:
Persons
who buy
goods from
producers
and sell
them to
consumers.
The
middlemen
charge a
fee for this
service.

They would have to cycle or walk to nearby villages to sell
the milk under scorching heat. As you know, milk spoils or
curdles very fast in hot weather. The farmers had to sell the
milk quickly before it could spoil. This was a lot of effort
for the small amount of money they would earn. So, they
depended on people called middlemen, who would buy the
milk in bulk at meagre prices from the farmers and sell it
in the market. Many times, the farmers felt cheated and
harassed by the middlemen.

Pasteurisation:
A process by
which milk
is preserved
through heating
to a specific
temperature
to kill harmful
bacteria.

This initiative brought farmers, including women, together
and gave them control over the production and sale of
milk. The milk producers collectively made their own
decisions on all matters such as production, pasteurisation
and sale of milk. The tasks were shared by everyone, which
helped raise their income gradually. They did not need the
middlemen anymore and became like one big family!
As more and more farmers
began to see the benefits
of the cooperative, it
continued to grow. The
quantity of milk that was
being collected was so
huge that the farmers
decided to make other
products out of it. They set
up a factory in Anand, and
began to produce butter and
milk powder.

Factory: Building
or group of
buildings where
goods are
manufactured,
or various
components are
put together,
to make a final
product.

Retail: The
sale of goods
in small
quantities
for use by
the end
consumer
rather than
for resale.
Export:
Goods and
services
that are
produced
in one
country
and sold to
buyers or
consumers
in another
country.

Today, the cooperative has a
wide range of products made
at many milk processing
plants and factories all
over India. Can you name a
few? The products are then
transported and sold in both
small and large retail shops
all over the country. In fact, they also export the products to
several countries around the world. Is it not amazing?
In this fascinating story, the farmers of this cooperative
milk their cows to sell the milk later. This kind of economic
activity is called a primary sector economic activity because
the product (milk) is derived directly from a natural source
(cows/livestock).

Milk is then processed and converted from one form (liquid)
into another — milk powder, ghee, cheese, butter and many
others in the factories. These economic activities are called
secondary sector economic activities.

Just like AMUL, there are many other milk cooperatives under
brands such as Nandini from Karnataka, Mother Dairy from
Delhi-NCR, Aavin from Tamil Nadu, Vijaya from Andhra
Pradesh, Kevi from Nagaland, Sudha from Bihar, Verka from
Punjab, etc. Can you name one cooperative around you that
has helped groups like farmers, persons with disabilities, and
women, to come together and has brought prosperity to their
lives?

14 ― Economic Activities Around Us
What does AMUL do with all the products it makes? It sells
them in various places. AMUL uses lorries and trucks, as
well as railway, air and shipping services, to transport its
products. It has set up retail stores and supplies milk and
milk products to other shops in towns, cities and villages
all over Gujarat, as well as in different states across India.
Here, transportation, trading and retail is a tertiary activity.

With the help of the images below, let’s see how the books
you study are made. The images show the transformation
of pulp (wooden fibre of a tree) into paper and, after
printing, into textbooks.

None of the activities that were part of the process – from
extracting pulp from the trees to making paper and finally
producing the books would have been possible, had it not
been for all three sectors working together.

What are the different ways
through which we can judiciously
use paper in the classrooms and
offices of your school?

14 ― Economic Activities Around Us
These days, used paper is recycled to make new paper.
Recycling just one tonne of paper saves 17 trees as well as 2.5
cubic metres of landfill space, where waste is dumped. It also
takes 70 per cent less energy and water to recycle paper than
to make new paper from wood pulp.

The various examples and illustrations helped to understand
the difference as well as the interdependence between the
three types of economic activities or sectors — primary,
secondary and tertiary.
