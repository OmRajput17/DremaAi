On 27 May 2020, people in a village in Assam heard a loud bang and came out of
their houses. The name of the village was Baghjan. Lots and lots of gas was coming
out from a nearby oil well. Thirteen days later, a big fire started in the well.
People dig wells in oilfields to bring up oil. lt is used to make kerosene and even
plastic and medicines. Maguri Beel is a wetland
near the oilfield. A wetland is a place filled with
ponds and lakes. lt has many birds, animals
and fish. More than 300 types of birds come
to Maguri every year. They eat insects like
mosquitoes. ln this way, the birds help people.
The villages near Maguri Beel don't have many
mosquitoes! Birdwatchers from all parts of
lndia come to Maguri Beel to see ducks, geese
and storks.A bird at Maguri Beel
The fire in the oilfield destroyed Maguri Beel. A herd of wild buffaloes lived in the
area. No one saw them after the fire. A little distance away from Maguri Beel is the
Dibru Saikhowa National Park. lt is famous for its beautiful wild horses. No one
saw rhem after the fire either. But the wetland saved the villages on the other side
of the fire. That is why we should take care of our forests and rivers along with the
animals, birds and fish living in them.
