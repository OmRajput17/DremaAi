Countable nouns can be singular and plural.
Singular and Plural Nouns
Singular nouns tell us about one person, place, animal or thing.
Plural nouns tell us about more than one person, animal, place or thing.
We form the plurals of nouns in the following ways.
By adding -s at the end of the singular word.
Examples: toy→ toys
car→ cars pot → pots
By adding -es to words ending in -s, -ss, -x, -sh, -ch, -0.
Examples: bus→ buses class classes fox-foxes
-
brush-brushes branch branches potato potatoes
By adding -ies after removing -y from words ending with a
consonant + -yi
Examples: baby babies
mummy mummies
=
lady-ladies puppy → puppies
Watch Out!
Some nouns look plural
but are actually singular or
uncountable.
subjects (physics, mathematics)
Examples: news, names of
names of illnesses (measles,
mumps, uncountable)
By adding-ves after removing-for-fe from words ending with -for-fe.
Examples: knife knives
wife-wives leaf leaves
Some nouns do not follow these rules while changing from singular to plural. Such nouns are
called irregular nouns.
Examples: man→ men child children
ох → охел
mouse → mice goose geese

Let's Get Started
Circle the words which show that something belongs to someone.
This is Tanmay's globe.

after a noun to show belonging.
Examples: These are Nina's toys. (These toys belong to Nina.)
This is Garv's bicycle. (This bicycle belongs to Garv.)
For singular nouns not ending in -s, we put an apostrophe ('s)
after the word.

For singular nouns ending in -s, we put only the apostrophe after
the word.
Examples: James' shirt, Thomas' hat
For plural nouns ending in -s, we use only the apostrophe after the

Subject and Predicate
A sentence has two parts: the subject and the predicate.
The subject tells us who or what the sentence is about.
The predicate tells us something more about the subject.
Look at this sentence.
The man stood at the gate.
To find the subject of a sentence, ask the question who or what to
the verb. When we ask, 'Who stood at the gate?', the answer is the
man. This is the subject.
Grammar Byte
The predicate always
includes the verb.
The predicate may also
be of just one word.
Examples: The beggar ate.
The rest of the sentence is the predicate. Here, the predicate is stood at the gate.
Here are some more examples.

Adjectives are of four main kinds: adjectives of quality, quantity, number, and demonstrative
adjectives.
Adjectives of Quality
An adjective of quality tells us about the size, shape, colour or particular quality of a noun or pronoun.
Examples: I had a cold drink yesterday.
She baked a delicious cake for me.
Raghav is a proud man.
Flowers smell sweet.
It is a large box.

6. She put the flowers in the vase.
7. The beggar walked across the road.

Adjectives of Quantity
An adjective of quantity tells us how much of something there is. It does not show the exact number.
Examples: All the apples were rotten.
Some children reached early.
Many people bought the new televisions, but few people bought the radios.
Adjectives of number tell us the number or position of people, animals and things.
Cardinal numbers like one, two and three and ordinal numbers like first, second and third are
adjectives of number.
Examples: I have five close friends.
The fifth girl in the row is a good singer.
Sara bought three mangoes and two apples.
The first shop on the road sells fruits and the third shop sells vegetables.
Underline the adjectives in these sentences and write whether they are adjectives of
quality, quantity or number.

2. My grandfather is seventy years old. He is wise and kind.
3. The sky is very cloudy. Can you see any birds in the sky?
4. I want some red thread, many colourful beads, and two cardboard
squares for art class.

8. Only one piece of the lemon tart is left. Do you want the last bite?
9. Thirty days after the earthquake, the normal activities of the town started again.
10. Take the second book on the shelf. It has funny stories.
Demonstrative Adjectives
Adjectives which point out people or things are called
demonstrative adjectives. There are four demonstrative adjectives:
this, that, these and those.
Examples: This book is quite interesting.
That parrot has beautiful green feathers.
These dresses are too big for me.
Those boys are very noisy.
Grammar Byte
This and these are used
for objects which are
close by.
That and those are used

Degrees of Comparison
Let's Get Started
Look at these sentences.
Rohit is four feet tall.
His brother, Rohan, is taller than him.
Rohit is taller than his younger sister, Radha.
Who is the tallest among Rohit, Rohan and Radha?
The words tall, taller and tallest are adjectives. We use adjectives to compare a particular quality
between people and things.
Look at these sentences.
The maroon box is big.
The pink box is bigger than the maroon one.
The blue box is the biggest of the three.
In the first sentence, the word big is the usual form of the adjective. We
are not comparing the size of the box with that of any other box.
In the second sentence, the size of the pink and the maroon boxes are
being compared using the adjective bigger.
In the third sentence, more than two boxes are being compared.
The adjective shows that the blue box is the biggest in size out of the three boxes.
When we talk about the quality of one person or thing and do not make any comparison with
others, we use the positive degree of comparison.
When we compare a particular quality in two people or things, we use the comparative degree.
When we compare a particular quality in more than two people or things, we use the
superlative degree.

The degrees of comparison are formed in the following ways.

The baby sleeps in its cot.
I cook dinner every Tuesday.
She plays with her dolls in the evening.
These sentences talk about facts in the present. Sentences 3 and 4 talk about things that
happen regularly. The verbs keep, sleeps, cook and plays are in the simple present tense. We often
use time words like in the evening, every Tuesday, usually, always, every day with the
present tense.
The simple present tense talks about an action that takes place in the present moment.
We often add -s or -es to the base form of the verb to form the simple present tense.
We use the simple present tense to form questions. We also use it to form negative sentences
by adding do not/does not before the verb.

The subject can be singular or plural.
Look at the following sentences.
468
The moon shines at night.
Bees suck nectar from flowers.
I like to read books.
He is eating pizza.
The subjects, the moon, I and he are singular, while bees is plural.

3. The dancers are going to France for a show.

Look at the following sentences again.
The moon shines at night.
The subject the moon is singular. The verb shines is also singular.
Bees suck nectar from flowers.
The subject bees is plural. The verb suck is also plural.
In a sentence, the verb must always agree with the subject in number and person. If the subject is
singular, the verb must also be singular. If the subject is plural, then the verb must also be plural.
This is known as agreement of the verb and the subject.
These are the forms that the following verbs take with singular and plural subjects.

when used with I. You and the verb that goes with it can refer to both a singular or a

Questions or Interrogative Sentences
Questions or interrogative sentences ask questions. We put a question mark (?) after them.
Examples: Who is the man in the red hat?
What is in your bag?
Is Mohan sick today?
The first two sentences are wh-questions as they begin with a wh- word.
Other words used in interrogative sentences are who, whose, whom, which, what, when, where, why
and how.
The third question is a yes/no question. The answer to such a question is either yes or no.
B Put the correct punctuation mark after each sentence and state its kind.
1. Whose cat is this
2. Is this your bag or mine
3. All that glitters is not gold
4. Whose team won the trophy
5. The evening is cool and pleasant
6. Do you like to travel
7. Two and two make four
8. Who did this task
We can form yes/no questions from statements in the following two ways.
For sentences with verbs like is, am, are, was, were, and can, could, may, will, would, we move the
verb before the subject of the sentence.
Examples: We are going to school today.
He is my friend.
She won't help me.
Rama was crying
They could reach on time.
Are we going to school today?
→ Is he my friend?
Won't she help me?
Was Rama crying?
Could they reach on time?
For sentences with action verbs like walk, eat, play, we add do, does or did at the beginning of the
sentence. The verb remains in its basic form.
Example: They run in the field.
Do they run in the field?
For sentences with have or had, we add do, does or did at the beginning of the sentence.
Example: Shweta has many pencils.
Does Shweta have many pencils?
Form a yes/no question with each of the sentences. Remember to add a question mark.
1. This pen is yours.
2. She will go to New Delhi tomorrow.
3. Dhanush is coming home tonight.
4. David was playing badminton yesterday.

put an exclamation mark (!) at the end of such a sentence.
Examples: How happy I am to see you!

Command or Imperative Sentence
An imperative sentence is used to make a request, give a command or advice.

The Broken Pot
108)
Read the story.
Once, there lived a poor man called Sundar. A
kind man gave him a sack of flour. He made rotis
with some of the flour and ate them. But there
was still a potful left. He hung the pot from a
nail in the wall above his bed. At night, he could
not stop looking at the pot. All the while, he
thought, 'This pot is filled to overflowing with
flour. If a famine comes, I can sell it for a hundred
pieces of silver. Then, I can buy a pair of goats.
They will have kids every six months. I will soon
have an entire herd of goats. Then, I will sell
the goats for cattle. As soon as the cows have calves, I will sell the calves. Then, I will sell the
cattle for buffaloes. Then, I will sell the buffaloes for horses. When the horses have foals, I will
have many horses. By selling them, I will get pots of gold. With this gold, I will buy a house
with four outbuildings. Then, I will get married. My wife and I will have a son. I will call him
Somasarman. When he is old enough to sit on my knee, I will sit in the courtyard and read.
Somasarman will see me and want to sit on my knee. He will climb down from his mother's
lap and walk towards me. He will come close to the pet dog sitting beside me. Seeing them, I
will angrily tell my wife, "Look at what Somasarman is doing!" But she will be busy and will not
hear me. So I will jump up. In doing so, I will step on the dog by mistake."

Jane and the Bears
110
Read the story.
Jane loved to read fairy tales. Her favourite story was the one in which naughty Goldilocks
entered the three bears' house, ate their food and damaged their furniture. Jane liked to go
into the woods and sit under an oak tree and imagine the bears talking to her.
One day, she felt that the bears were real, and by searching in the woods, she could find them.
She set out, but soon it got dark. She tried to return home but couldn't find the way. She sat
down under a big tree and burst into tears.
'Little girl, why do you cry?" a
big, kind voice said.
Jane answered, 'I am lost."
'Lost?" asked the big voice.
"Where were you going?"
'To find the three bears."
"Why, I am Mr Bear, what do
you want with us?"
'Oh, are you truly real bears?"
Jane said, for she couldn't see in the
darkness.
"Of course!' roared Mr Bear. "What a rude question!'
'Oh, I am so sorry,' Jane replied fearfully, 'Please don't eat me!"
Mr Bear felt sorry for her.
'Climb on my back. I will take you to Mrs Bear and Baby Bear," he said.
She agreed and off they went.
Deep in the forest, they came to the little house from the story, with its three doors, three
windows, and three chimneys. They stopped in front of one of the doors, and out ran Baby
Bear. When he saw Jane, he gave a little squeal and hurried back in.
Mamma Bear came to the door. "Whom have you brought now?" she said.
'It's a little girl,' said Mr Bear, "I found her in the woods, looking for our house."
Mamma Bear welcomed Jane inside.
As Jane stepped in, she saw the big chair that was too hard, the medium one that was too soft,
and the little chair that Goldilocks had broken. It was mended with string. They showed her
the great, big bowl of very peppery soup, the medium-sized bowl of very salty soup, and Baby
Bear's bowl, mended with glue. He let Jane taste only a little because he was afraid she would
take it all.
Jane wanted to go home now. But Mr Bear couldn't take her, for it was too far away and he
didn't know the way.
'Why don't you call Red Riding Hood's wolf?" Mamma Bear said. 'He knows the way out of the
forest.'
So, they all went in front of the house and waited. A big, grey wolf soon arrived. The wolf was
delighted to help, but said he had to go first to the Grandmother's cottage because he had a
message to give Red Riding Hood. Jane climbed on the wolf's back and off they went.

The Bug and
the Mosquito
Read the story.
There once lived a bug in the bedroom of a king's palace. The
bug had a large family with many sons and daughters. At night,
when the king slept, they crept to his bed and feasted on his
blood.
One day, a mosquito came into the king's room through the
large window. It flew around the room and sat on the king's bed. 'How comfortable the bed is!
I'm sure the king's blood too must taste as sweet as honey,' it said aloud. When the bug heard
the mosquito speak, it came out and began to ask questions to the mosquito.
'Who are you and why are you here?' the bug demanded.
'I am a wanderer and this is the first time I have entered a king's palace. I have drunk the blood
of many, but never the blood of a king. It must be very sweet and tasty."
"Yes, it is, but you cannot have it,' said the bug, with a serious face.
"Why not?' the mosquito asked.
"Well, when you bite the king, he will jump up and kill all of us,' said the bug.
But the mosquito would not leave. It pleaded, 'Oh, please, let me taste his blood once. I
promise I will be as silent as a mouse and leave after a single bite."
The bug took pity on the mosquito. 'All right, just this once. But remember to do it at the right
time and at the right spot. The right time is after the king drinks his milk and goes to bed. The
right place is his foot. If you bite him there after he falls asleep, he will not know."
That night, the mosquito waited until the king came to his room and lay down on his bed. By
then, the mosquito was very hungry. It could not wait anymore. 'Just a tiny bite,' it thought,
The king will never know."
He flew up to the bed. Just as the king was about to fall asleep, the mosquito bit him on the
neck. The king howled in pain and sat up with a start.
'Men, find them now and arrest them!' he shouted.
His servants came rushing in. The king asked them to search the room thoroughly for the insect
that had bitten him. By then, the mosquito had fled. But the servants found the bug with all its
children and grandchildren in the bed.
'They are the ones who bit me!' the king shouted. "Kill them all!"
The bug and his family tried to escape, but to no avail. If only he had not let the mosquito
taste the king's blood!

The Three Questions
Read the story.
Once, there was a homeless young man who begged
for food. But the food always disappeared at night.
One night he stayed awake, and found a mouse
stealing his food.
"Why do you steal from me? I am such a poor man',
he said.
"It is your luck that you stay poor', the mouse
replied.
"But why is that my luck?" asked the surprised
beggar.
"Perhaps you should go and ask the Buddha."
The beggar set off to meet the Buddha. On his way, he met a rich man who welcomed him to his
house and gave him food to eat and a bed to sleep in.
When the beggar told him that he was going to meet the Buddha, the rich man said, 'My
daughter cannot speak. Could you ask the Buddha when she will be able to speak?"
'I will,' the man promised.
On his way, he reached a swiftly flowing river. A giant turtle agreed to take him across the river
on its back. When the turtle found out that the man was going to meet the Buddha, it said,
"I have been trying to become a dragon for five hundred years. Can you ask the Buddha how I
can become one?"
The young man agreed.
When he finally reached where the Buddha was, he heard him say, 'As there are so many of
you, I will answer only two questions for each person'.
The young man was worried, for he had three questions to ask. Which one should he leave out?
"I'm just a homeless man. My problem is not as big as those of others,' he thought.
So, he asked their questions and on getting the answers, began his homeward journey.
Upon meeting the turtle, he told it, 'If you step out of the comfort of your shell, you will
become a dragon."
The turtle took off its shell and immediately became a dragon. Inside its shell were many
priceless pearls. It gave them to the beggar to thank him and flew off.
When the beggar met the rich man, he told him, "Your daughter will speak when she meets the
man she is supposed to marry."
At that moment, a young woman came down and said, 'Is this the man who came to our
house two days ago?'
117
Her father was overjoyed on hearing her speak for the first time.
"Yes,' he replied. "Will you marry him, my daughter?"
She agreed and they started a life together.
Thus, the poor man's problems were solved when he decided to help others.

Our Lemons
Read the passage.
I got up early. I promised I would help pick the
lemons before I went to school.
My family has more than 20 lemon trees.
My father has a job in town. He also works
at the post office and delivers mail. The lemon
trees help us make some more money.
We live in southern California in the USA. It
is warm most of the time. So the lemon trees
stay green all year round.
My father says California grows the most
lemons in the world. Every day we check the lemons to see if they are about two inches in
length. When they get that big, they are ready to pick.
They are still green when we pick them. They turn yellow after we pick them and put

The lemons grow all year. Every day, there are some to pick. So we always have a job to do.
Some times in the year there are more lemons than usual. Those weeks we work all day on
Saturday and Sunday too. My father also makes more trips into town with the lemons.
Once, my
father let one lemon stay on the tree. He wanted to see how big it got. First it turned
yellow. Then it turned orange and got as big as a pumpkin, too. Finally, it was so big and heavy
that it fell off. I tasted it, but I didn't like it.
My father said, "Pick them when they're green and small. They will taste better."
Down the road from our house is a really big lemon grove. It has hundreds of trees. Workers
pick the fruit, put them into crates and take them to the train station. They send them to
faraway places along with the oranges they grow. On the way, they turn yellow. There are
people all over the world who buy them.
My mother says that lemons are great but not by themselves. She wants us to grow apples. But
we can't do that because the weather is not right here. When my father goes to the store, he
comes back with apples. Those apples grow in Washington state.
My mother says our kitchen has foods from many places. She likes to drink tea from China. She
puts our lemons and some sugar in her tea. She says the sugar comes from Brazil. So, there are
three countries in that one cup!

Vishpala
Read this story.
Vishpala was born to run. She really wanted to be in Khela's race.
'Don't be silly,' everyone said to her.
'Even if you had both legs, you couldn't
win."
"Winning is about believing," said
Vishpala. 'If only I was blessed with
another leg to support me, I would win."
That night Vishpala couldn't sleep. She
asked the elders in her village, 'Is there
anything you can do to help me?"
The carpenter gave her a crutch. But that
wouldn't work, thought Vishpala.
'Maybe a pair of wings?" asked someone.
"But I want to run, not fly,' she replied.
Vishpala's grandmother comforted her as she wept that night. 'Pray to the Ashvin Kumaras,"
she advised. "They are the doctors of this universe. They must know a way."
Vishpala had nothing to lose. Her grandmother was wise and perhaps the gods would help her,
she thought.
She kneeled on her good knee and prayed to the Ashvin Kumaras, the gods who had medicinal
cures for everyone. They were the gods who were generous with their gifts. They were her only
chance. The Ashvin Kumaras heard her prayers. They came to see her with a gift. It was a gift
that no one had expected, a gift so unique that no one knew if it would work. It was an iron
leg, not made of flesh and bone, but a leg that might help her run.
Vishpala was fitted with the iron leg that night and she ran like the wind in the race the next
day. Her dreams had come true. She was indeed the fastest runner in the race.
Thank you for your advice,' said Vishpala to her grandmother.
"You won because you believed,' her grandmother replied. 'Your courage brought you victory."

Rajan, the snake charmer, lived in a little hut by the river Ganges
with his wife Amba. They were poor but happy. Every day, Rajan
picked up the pot in which he kept his snake, along with his mat
and pipe and went to the village square. He played the pipe and
out came the snake from the pot, swaying its head from side to
side. People ooh-ed and aah-ed, clapped and threw coins. In the
evening, Rajan collected the money, fed his snake and returned
home to his wife.
One day, he said to his wife, Today, I will go to the town
with the snake. There are more people in a town and I will get
more money."
Rajan walked to the town. In the busy town square, he put down
pot and started playing his pipe. Soon, the snake came out

When his wife saw the gold coins, she was overjoyed. "We are rich! We will be able to eat well
now and never have to worry about money again.' She put the gold in a big pot. 'Tomorrow,
we must find a safe place to hide it."
Three thieves were watching them through the window. They had heard about the gold and
were waiting for Rajan and Amba to fall asleep so that they could steal it.

Late in the night, Amba heard a noise. "What's that?" she whispered, sitting up in bed. She was
worried about the gold. She got up and picked up the pot with the gold. Then, she looked at
the other pot with the snake and thought, 'That's just as precious.' So she picked up both
and took them to the top of the house where she thought they would be safe.
Outside, the thieves had seen Amba carry up the pots. They stood on each other's shoulders
and reached the top. Carefully, they picked up a pot and ran away. But when they opened the
lid, to their horror, a deadly snake came out and hissed angrily. The thieves threw down the pot
and ran away in fear.

house. He opened it to find it full of gold. He understood what had happened. He quietly sat

The Stork and the Crab
Read the story.
Once upon a time, there lived a stork beside a pond. There were
many fish and water animals in the pond. The stork had plenty to
eat and lived happily. But after a few years, he started to get old.
Sometimes he could not catch fish to eat. He was very worried.
He came up with a plan. He stood by the edge of the pond
looking sad and thoughtful. The fish, frogs and crabs asked him
the reason for his sadness. The stork replied, 'I am scared for you
all, my friends. I have lived by the pond for so long. To think that
it will no longer have any water scares me. When that happens, you will die and I will be all
alone.'
"Why, Mister Stork?' asked a crab.
'I heard people say that they will empty the water in the pond and grow crops over it."
The creatures believed the stork. They asked him to find a way out.
The sly stork said, "I am only a bird. I cannot do much but I know of a bigger and deeper lake a
little way from here. I can take you all there if you wish."
"Yes, please, Mister Stork. We don't want to die,' the fish and the other creatures cried.
The stork took a few fish in its beak and set out. But it did not
take them to the lake. It flew up to a big rock and ate them.
Then it returned to the pond to take more fish. This carried on
for some time.
Soon, most of the fish had been eaten by the stork and the pond
was half empty. Only the crabs were left. The stork thought, 'I
want to eat a crab. Let me take a crab this time.'
'Shall I take you to the beautiful lake, Master Crab?' the stork asked the crab who had spoken
to him earlier.
"Yes, please,' cried the crab happily and climbed on the stork's back. The stork flew off. After
some time, the crab looked down for his new home but could see no lake.
He asked the stork, "Where is the big lake you are taking me to?"
The stork laughed and exclaimed, 'Do you see the big rock down there? I am taking you there
like I took all your other friends."
125
126
The crab saw the fish bones lying on the big rock. He realised what the stork was about to do.
It dug its claws deep into the stork's neck. The stork could not breathe or fly and fell to the
ground, dead. The crab went back to the old pond and told the others the truth about the
stork.
'You saved us!' they cried. "If it wasn't for you, the stork would have eaten us all."

The Return of the
Whistling Dog
Read the passage.
In February 2020, forest officials and scientists
in Gujarat had some exciting news to share. Two
Asiatic wild dogs, or dholes, had been seen in the
Vansda National Park after 50 years.
People think the dhole to be a cruel hunter and
a pest which enters villages and hunts animals.
It looks like a mix between a fox and dog, with a
bushy, black tail.
Today, we know that dholes are shy animals who
prefer avoiding humans. They help protect the
forest, as all big hunters, like tigers and leopards, do. Dholes only live in dense jungles with
enough prey animals. So, a dhole population means that a forest is doing well.
Only around 2,500 dholes remain in the world. Of these, 1000 are in India, mostly in the
south Indian state of Karnataka. Their numbers have kept falling as they lose their homes
when forests are cut down for human activities and because of diseases. They are also killed by
people for entering villages.
Forest officials think that the two dholes arrived in Vansda because the movement of people
around the forest came down greatly during the coronavirus lockdown. They have set up
hidden cameras to watch the dholes' movements and activities. They say that the dholes - who
may have come from Maharashtra - have settled down in their new home.
The two dholes hunt in two separate areas of the forest at present. They hunt deer and meet
up in the evening. They were also once seen feeding on the remains of a leopard.
Dholes like living in groups and form packs of up to 40. They are also called 'whistling dogs', as
they make a whistling sound when they hunt.
within
The Vansda National Park is now working with an NGO named Nature Club Surat to raise
spotted deer. The deer will add to the big hunters' prey and ensure that the animals stay
the forest, and don't enter villages to hunt.
In the past few years, the number of people living around the forest has grown. Leopards often
enter the villages. They are caught by forest officials from nearby sugarcane fields and released
into the forest.
127
128)
A 16-km state highway and a train route also cut through the national park. The street lights
around the nearby villages and the tourists who come to a nearby hill station, all add to the
disturbance the wild animals face.
But animal lovers hope that the dholes' return might be the beginning of a new pack in the
forest.
A Write T for true and F for false.
1. Dholes are Asiatic wolves.
2. Dholes live in large groups of around 40.
3. Two dholes were seen in Gujarat in February 2020.
4. A dhole population means that a forest is getting destroyed.

Paragraph Writing
A paragraph is a group of sentences that talk about a topic or an idea. The first sentence in a

topic. The final sentence sums up the main points clearly.
Read these sample paragraphs.
Why We Should Save Trees
Trees should not be cut down because they are very important for life
on earth. They give us oxygen to breathe and take away carbon dioxide
from the air. Trees also protect the soil with their long roots. They
give us delicious fruits, like mangoes, apples, peaches and lychees. It is
always nice to sit under the shade of a tree during summer. In places
where there are lots of trees, the temperature is always cooler. Trees
are also very beautiful. The gulmohar tree has bright red flowers while
trees like the amaltas paint the ground yellow wherever they grow. We
can save trees by educating people about their importance. We should
also plant trees. Each of us can plan to plant one tree every year and
take care of it.
The Day I Got a Surprise
Last Monday, the day began as usual. I went to school. I came home
and did my homework in the evening. My parents come home at
6 o'clock every day, but that day, they were not back even at 8 o'clock.
I asked my grandmother many times where they were, but she only
smiled a mysterious smile. I felt very impatient because I wanted to tell
my mother what had happened in school that day. I was also waiting
for my father because we watch cartoons together in the evening. At
9 o'clock, the bell rang. My parents came in. In my mother's hand was
a basket. My mother asked me to open it. Out came a small, brown
furry head with a pink nose. Then a tiny tongue began to lick my
fingers. It was a puppy! I was so surprised that I could not speak.
My birthday was the week after and the puppy was my birthday
present! My mother said that the puppy was from an animal shelter.
I have named the puppy Tilu. I love him very much.

A Visit to a National Park
Last Saturday, my parents took us to Bannerghatta National Park near
Bengaluru. Bannerghatta National Park is known for the wide variety
of animals and birds that live there. I was very excited to see the wild
animals there. As it was a weekend, it meant that hundreds of people
would be visiting the park. We left early from home so that we could
reach before the rush began.
The park has a zoo, a butterfly park, an
aquarium, and a safari park. We took a
safari ride that let us see the large animals in
their natural habitat, outside cages. We saw
many lions, tigers, panthers and bears. We
also saw giraffes, buffaloes, deer and zebras.
It was wonderful to see them roaming
up.
Introduction

population. We saw different types of snakes and crocodiles. I was even
allowed to touch one of the non-poisonous snakes.

butterflies from all around the world. There
is an animal rescue centre at the park where
veterinarians and other zoo workers take care
of injured animals. There is a kids' zone as well, which has a large
playground. Whenever we got hungry, we ate at the local canteens.

The visit to Bannerghatta National Park was very memorable. It was an

The Alien Who Came to Earth
Once upon a time, there was an alien who lived on the planet, Mars. He could see Earth from
his house. He wanted to visit Earth. So one day, he took his spaceship and set out for Earth.
Once his spaceship landed on Earth, he got out and looked around. He saw two humans
hiding behind a tree. They looked scared. The alien couldn't understand why they were
frightened. Suddenly, he realised that they were scared of him! He quickly looked at himself-
he had green skin and red hair, and he was much taller than the humans. He closed his eyes
and thought about how he would look if he were a human. When he opened his eyes, he had
black hair and brown skin. He also became much shorter than before. The alien called out to
135
136
the humans, 'Hello! I will not harm you. You can come closer.' The humans - a boy and a girl
- walked towards him slowly. The alien said to them, "Don't be afraid! I'm just visiting Earth.
Would you please show me around?' The boy, who was called Ani and the girl, whose name
was Madhura, were thrilled! The boy replied, "Yes! Why don't you come with us?' They eagerly
showed the alien their hometown. After a day of fun, the alien decided that he must return
home. Ani and Madhura were sad to hear that the alien had to leave, but he promised that he
would visit soon. 'Please keep my visit a secret,' he requested them. After saying goodbye, the
alien got back into his spaceship and returned to Mars. He was very happy that he had finally
been to Earth and made two friends.
