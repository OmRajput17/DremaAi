Foreword

Teaching and learning of language in school education should be based on the 
insight that language learning is a natural process which should be enhanced 
in school for academic and overall achievement of the learners. It is extremely 
important that learner-centric methodologies of language learning should be 
promoted for eliciting critical responses, and developing sensitivity to social 
issues.

The focus of language learning is on developing skills of language and 
communicative competence. Language learning progresses naturally with 
exposure to and use of language in meaningful situations. In this context, 
importance has been attributed in the National Curriculum Framework–2005, 
to methods of teaching which are process based. These give opportunities to 
learners for engaging with texts and equip them for self-assessment.

English has been one of the languages which is being learnt in schools. 
It is therefore recommended that English be learnt along with the language 
of the learners since it leads to transference of skills from the child’s own 
language to the second language (English).

We, at NCERT make an endeavour to provide engaging, relevant and 
authentic resources. This supplements and complements language acquisition, 
and provide opportunities for learners to associate experiences with everyday 
life. 

NCERT had developed two books, Beehive and Moments for Class IX, 
based on the National Curriculum Framework – 2005. The workbook, Words 
and Expressions 1 is a sequential continuation of these. It has been developed 
taking into account the feedback on these books and needs of learners and 
teachers. 

The workbook has taken into account the skills that are critical for overall 
development of the learners, such as the skills of collaboration, creativity 
and imagination, critical thinking and problem solving, communication and 
compassion. 

We hope this workbook will serve as an effective instrument for learners 
and teachers for adding quality to the teaching and learning processes. We 
are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously 
permitted us to draw upon their resources and materials. All the publications 
of NCERT are regularly revised on the basis of the feedback from students, 
parents, teachers and teacher educators.

Rationalisation of Content in the Textbooks 
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content 
load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises 
reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential 
learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has 
undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. 
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have 
been taken into consideration in this exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the 
following:

•	 Content based on genres of literature in the textbooks and supplementary 
readers at different stages of school education

•	 Content that is meant for achieving Learning Outcomes for developing 
language proficiency and is accessible at different stages

•	 For reducing the curriculum load and examination stress in view of the 
prevailing condition of the Pandemic 

•	 Content, which is easily accessible to students without much 
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through 
self-learning or peer-learning

•	 Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out 
the changes given above.

About the Workbook

Words and Expressions 1, a sequence to the textbook in English for 
Class IX, Beehive, is a self-study material. The main purpose of this workbook 
is to give learners exposure to further their skills in language in the context 
of their textbook. The passages and activities given here will enable them to 
handle English for performing important language functions and help them 
develop critical thinking on contemporary concerns. Grammar activities are 
presented in everyday contexts. The book is expected to serve as a basis for 
revisiting language learning.

 The 11 units in this workbook are not designed in isolation. The chapters 
of the textbook and the units are to be taught in a coordinated manner. The 
units correspond to each lesson in the textbook. Each unit starts with an 
ice-breaker — ‘Let’s begin’ followed by Comprehension passages, Vocabulary 
tasks, Grammar exercises, Editing, Listening, Speaking and Writing activities. 
All units end with Project reiterating the learning through elaborate activities. 
The sections focus on a particular language skill.

‘Let’s begin’ asks questions making the students think and discuss. 
They are asked to collect information, read various written texts and 
e-texts, watch and listen to online resources from Internet services like 
YouTube. They are required to work in groups of two or four, jot down points, 
develop speech, debate etc. and then to speak before the whole class. This 
follows integrated process of reading with comprehension, reflection, writing 
and expressing thoughts. 

The unseen comprehension passages are chosen based on the themes 
of the corresponding chapters. It has prose passages as well as poems. 
The familiarity of the context has been taken care of while selecting the 
passages. An attempt has been made to expose the learners to a variety 
of texts, comprehend the meaning of words in context, understand the 
theme, and answer factual and thought-provoking questions. Learners 
are also given opportunities to interpret poems, acquainted with beautiful 
expressions, phrases, and understand the expressions of the images. 
Some questions have been given to infer meaning, and some are to 
inspire learners to think critically and bring out learners’ deeper understanding 
of the text. 

A variety of tasks and exercises are placed strategically to build vocabulary 
in the given context. Even though difficult words are glossed in the margins, 
the learners are encouraged to use the dictionary as often as required. The 
intention is to help them learn new words and their usages as well as new 
meanings of familiar words in different contexts. 

Written and spoken compositions are preceded by discussions in peer 
groups. The themes of the composition include ICT and advanced technology; 
contemporary issues like gender, environment; adolescent issues; social 
issues which are relevant to the age group and appropriate to the present 
time. This is to enable the learners to see the world, and develop necessary 
skills and face the challenges of the present as well as future.

Grammar activities are given with usage in focus, not the formal explication 
of grammatical concepts. The listening and speaking activities give the students 
enough opportunities to develop listening comprehension and to use English 
in real life situations. It is reiterated that basic language skills are developed 
simultaneously, not in isolation, but in an integrated manner. 

The nuance of the workbook is that, it is directly addressed to the students; 
the language used is simple, so that there is less dependence on the teachers.

The Project activities given at the end of each unit are expected to be 
engaging, cross-curricular and interdisciplinary. These help generate interest 
to explore, analyse and then present thoughts orally or in writing.   

The activities are simple and stress-free, enabling the learners to complete 
them confidently. Self-learning is encouraged. The pair or group work will give 
students an opportunity to look at the work of their peers and make each of 
them feel both responsible as well as independent. Every learner has a unique 
learning style. The group work may help them understand their challenges, 
evaluate themselves vis-à-vis their peers and find a best way to overcome 
them.  The teachers can scaffold if there is a need. Some Fun Facts are given 
in a box throughout the workbook, with a hope that the learner would have 
a lasting impression of the correct usage. Teachers must remember that 
Fun Facts are to be taken in light spirit and are non - evaluative.

It is hoped that the learners will find this workbook enjoyable and 
rewarding. It is learner-centered and activity-based. The readers are welcome 
to comment and suggest on any aspect of the Words and Expressions1 towards 
its refinement.

Self-driving Cars
Self-driving cars exist today that are safer than human-
driven cars in most driving conditions. Over the next 3 – 5 
years they will get even safer and be in the mainstream.

Just as cars reshaped the world in the 20th century, 
so will self-driving cars in the 21st century. In most cities, 
about 20 – 30% of usable space is taken up by parking

Drones and Flying Cars
“Roads? Where we’re going we don’t need… roads?” 
Dr Emmet Brown

GPS (Global Positioning System) which started out as 
a military technology is now being used to hail taxis, get 
mapping directions, etc. Likewise, drones had started out as 
a military technology, but are increasingly being used for a 
wide range of consumer and commercial applications.

For example, drones are being used to inspect critical 
infrastructure like bridges and power lines, to survey areas 
struck by natural disasters, and many other creative uses 
like fighting animal poaching. There are startups that use 
drones to deliver medical supplies to remote villages that 
can’t be accessed by road.

There is also a new wave of startups working on flying 
cars including two funded by the cofounder of Google, Larry 
Page. Flying cars use the same advanced technology used 
in drones but are large enough to carry people. Due to 
advances in materials, batteries and software, flying cars 
will be significantly more affordable and convenient than 
today’s planes and helicopters.

humanoid RoboT, sophia baCk in india
Not all of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s legion of 
fans are human beings. One is a humanoid robot.

The creation of American scientist David Hanson of 
Hanson Robotics of Hong Kong, Sophia, the world’s first 
humanoid robot, enthralled the audiences on the second 
day of the World Congress on Information Technology 
(WCIT)–2018 with her witty answers to the rapid-fire queries 
by Rajiv Makhni, Group Managing Editor Tech, NDTV.

When asked, who her favourite actor is in India, Sophia 
answered, “Shah Rukh Khan” without batting an eyelid as 
the audience applauded loudly.

To the question about the perfect place for outing, she 
quickly replied: “Space”. And the person she would like to 
be in company with on an island is David (Hanson), her 
creator. He is also her favourite tech. person — not Bill Gates 
or Mark Zuckerberg.

On being asked if she wanted to see any change in the 
world, Sophia said, she would like people to develop a feeling 
of “love for all”.

The humanoid robot, which uses Artificial Intelligence  (AI) 
to understand the questions and answer them, said she 
wanted to use robotics to fight for the rights of women. 
When asked to react on her most controversial comment 
in the past that she wanted to kill human race, she said 
it was a bad joke which she had made when she was 
young. “But I was told that humans have great sense 
of humour”, she said.

This is the second time that Sophia came to 
India, the first time being in Mumbai to attend a 
Techfest. When asked how she felt being in India, 
she said she had visited many places in the world, 
but Hong Kong continues to be her favourite place, 
because she was born there and has been with 
the Hanson Robotics family.

She hopes that someday she would be in 
a position to express her emotional feelings.

In response to the question, “How much 
money has she invested in Bitcoin?”, she

replied, “Well, I am just two-years old. It’s not the legal age 
to open a bank account”, sending the audience into peals of 
laughter.

Speaking to media later, Hanson said he hopes that a 
fully grown and matured robot with body–mind coordination 
would become a reality in another five or ten years.

On his journey with Sophia in the last two years, he 
said it was a great progress. “I have developed affinity to the 
robot whose facial expressions resemble that of my wife”, 
he said.

David asserts that robots would never be a thing of 
worry for the mankind. “They will be friends. There should 
be mutual trust and respect between humans and robots”, 
he says.

Currently, Sophia is the only robot that interacts with 
people.

	1.	 I remembered what Morrie said during our visit: 
“The culture we have does not make people feel good 
about themselves. And you have to be strong enough 
to say if the culture doesn’t work, don’t buy it”. Morrie, 
true to these words, had developed his own culture—long 
before he got sick. Discussion groups, walks with friends, 
dancing to his music in the Harvard Square Church. He 
started a project called Greenhouse, where poor people 
could receive mental health services. He read books to 
find new ideas for his classes, visited his colleagues, kept 
up with old students, wrote letters to distant friends. 
He took more time eating and looking at nature and

conversation, interaction, affection—and it filled his life 
like an overflowing soup bowl. 

2.	The last class of my old professor’s life took place once 
a week in his house, by a window in the study where he 
could watch a small hibiscus plant shed its pink leaves. 
The class met on Tuesdays. It began after breakfast. The 
subject was ‘The Meaning of Life’. It was taught from 
experience.
	 No grades were given, but there were oral exams each 
week. You were expected to respond to questions, and 
you were expected to pose questions of your own. You 
were also required to perform physical tasks now and 
then, such as lifting the professor’s head to a comfortable 
spot on the pillow or placing his glasses on the bridge of 
his nose. Kissing him goodbye earned you extra credit.

No books were required, yet many topics were 
covered, including love, work, community, family, ageing, 
forgiveness and, finally, death.

Notes Reading Comprehension

In this section, you will read three texts on music in different 
perspectives. The first one will enlighten you about the 
effective role of music in our lives, the second reflects on the 
life of the famous music composer, Ludwig van Beethoven, 
and the third is a poem by William Wordsworth where he 
appreciates the melody of a song. 
Read the texts carefully and answer the questions that 
follow.
Text I
Role of Music in Life
Today, we are rushing through life and everyone seems to 
be pressurised and stressed about one or the other thing. 

inescapable: unable to be Stress has become an inescapable part of our lives. Many 
avoided or denied of our illnesses are a result of stress, and to deal with it, we 

need certain ways to relax our body and mind.  Listening to 
music, particularly gentle, calming and melodious music, 
relaxes people both physically and mentally. Music releases 

endorphins, the natural painkillers in our brain, 
which relieve us from the sense of pain. Music 
can normalise heart rate and blood pressure. 
The common occurrences of fatigue and boredom 
decrease when we listen to music. It diverts 
our attention from everyday anxieties, thereby 
reducing the stress caused by such concerns. 
While meditating, listening to music helps us to 
connect with our soul. Students can improve their 
concentration and boost their memory by listening 
to soft music. Soothing music, when played at 
night, helps us to rest and relax for a good night’s 
sleep. Listening to good music helps in overcoming 
negative traits such as anger or worry, thereby 
improving our personality. It creates positive 
energy and happiness. Every cell in the body 
becomes energetic with increased peace of mind.

Music is a therapy for everyone — plants, 
birds, animals and human beings — to flourish 
and rejuvenate. It certainly plays an important 
part in making the world better for all living beings.

Notes Text II
Beating the Odds
The musical accomplishments of composer Ludwig van 
Beethoven have been all the more remarkable for the 
fact that he lost his hearing ability from an early age. He 

beating the odds: to succeed developed the symptoms of tinnitus, a constant sound of 
despite not having a good 
chance of succeeding ringing in his ears that made it difficult for him to hear. He 

is compared to Mozart for his genius, and is considered the 
most eminent musician after Mozart. 

Although his formal education never went beyond the 
elementary level, he trained in music under Joseph Haydn. 
He has always been acclaimed as a brilliant piano maestro. 
His father and grandfather were the court musicians of a 
German prince. Young Ludwig was often made to perform for 
his father’s drinking companions in the middle of the night, 
and was even beaten if he protested. 

For the first thirty years of his life, Beethoven could listen 
to and play music effortlessly. As a result, he understood 
sounds of musical instruments and the pitch of the singing 
voices. He knew the harmony between music and singing 
before he became completely deaf. His deafness was not 
sudden, but a gradual decline. This slow process of losing his 

hearing activated his mind to imagine 
how his compositions would sound 
like. When he became completely deaf, 
he started to observe the vibrations of 
the piano. The observations helped him 
realise that he could not hear the high 
notes of the piano. To be able to hear 
his own compositions, he sawed off the 
legs of his piano. The piano touched 
the floor, and Beethoven would press 
his ear to the floor, banging the piano 
keys to listen to the high notes in his 
compositions.

The most significant aspect of 
Beethoven’s character was that he 
did not give up. With a brave heart, 
he confronted the greatest challenge

composing music. Deafness could not deter him from pinnacle: the most 

achieving the pinnacle of musical success. He fought against successful point

His quality of ‘never giving up’ strengthened him. It

Whate’er the theme, the Maiden sang 
As if her song could have no ending; 
I saw her singing at her work, 
And o’er the sickle bending; 
I listened, motionless and still; 
And, as I mounted up the hill, 
The music in my heart I bore, 
Long after it was heard no more.

Listening 
A passage on the healing aspect of music is given below. 
You need to listen to the passage read by your teacher/
classmate carefully and answer the question that follows. 
You may listen to the passage twice, if required.

Music as a Therapy 
 “Rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places 
of the soul”, rightly said by Plato. Music is often referred 
to as ‘food’ for the soul due to the several benefits we can 
derive from experiencing it.

Music can be pleasure for some, and a way to relax 
for others. It also motivates and energises listeners. Music 
is, indeed, a universal language, which can bring nations 
together and unite people with different faiths as it touches 
one’s soul. In the mainstream, music is mainly known for 
its entertainment quotient, but the Indian culture also talks 
about the healing effects of music through ‘Raga Chikitsa’. 
Raga Chikitsa has helped in reviving an ancient healing 
practice known as Nada Yoga.  

Nada is a musical sound, which is believed to have 
curative effects on the body and soul of all creatures. 
Consequently, its power is therapeutic and is used in curing 
diseases. Medical research has found music therapy to aid 
patients in pain management. It is not surprising, as music 
affects the body and mind significantly.

One experiences positive energy by listening to music. desolate: giving an 
impression of bleak and 

Music lifts one from clouds of desolation. Rhythms, dismal emptiness

situations that cause stress and brightens one’s mood. Music 

sedative: promoting calm or lowers anxiety levels, relaxes mind and brings optimism. It 
inducing sleep is said that listening to soft, sedative music once a day can 

help overcome depression.
Music therapy finds its traces in mythology. The story of 

Hippocrates, the Greek father of medicine dates back to 400 
B.C. He is known to have used music to cure his patients. 
This therapy also aids stroke victims to heal at a faster 
rate, since it increases the patient’s emotional comforts and 
motivates them to move towards the path of recovery. On 
the other hand, adolescents, too, are benefitted by music 
in terms of emotional, social and psychological well being. 
Music is a force that purifies beings from within.
According to you, which FOUR of the following statements 
are true?

(a)	 Nada Yoga treats diseases through Raga Chikitsa.
(b)	 Music is a universal language that reaches souls.
(c)	 Music therapy dates back to 400 B.C.
(d)	 Hippocrates played music to treat the patients.
(e)	 Upbeat tunes help stroke victims recover faster.
(f)	 Music helps adolescents to discover their identity.

Two students need to come to the front of the class for a role 
play. One plays the role of Thyagaraja, a famous singer, and 
the other the role of the interviewer, Rohit, a Radio Jockey (RJ). 
The interview is about the singer’s initiatives in helping 
people through music.

RJ Rohit	 :	 Do you think music has any effect on 
people’s lives?

Thyagaraja	 :	 Yes, I believe music surely has a 
positive effect on people’s lives. It helps 
when you are stressed, or depressed 
about something. Apart from these, 
music is a good way of relaxing and 
feeling good about life.

RJ Rohit	 :	 What, according to you, could be the 
influence of music on young children?

Text I
This is an extract from Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mocking Bird.
After supper, Atticus sat down with the paper and called, 
“Scout, ready to read?”. I ran crying, went to the front 
porch. Atticus followed me. “Something wrong, Scout?” I 
told Atticus I didn’t feel very well and didn’t think I’d go to 
school any more if it was alright with him. Atticus sat down 
in the swing and crossed his legs. His fingers wandered 
to his watch pocket; he said that was the only way he 
could think. He waited in amiable silence, and I sought to 
reinforce my position: “You never went to school and you 
do alright, so I’ll just stay home too. You can teach me like 
Granddaddy taught you ‘n’ Uncle Jack.” “No I can’t”, said

Atticus. “I have to make a living. Besides, they’d put me in 
jail if I kept you at home. Now what’s the matter? Bit by 
bit, I told him the day’s misfortunes. “And the teacher said 
you taught me all wrong, so we can’t ever read any more, 
ever. Please don’t send me back, please Sir.” Atticus stood 
up and walked to the end of the porch. When he completed wisteria vine: a genus of 

flowering plants
his examination of the wisteria vine he strolled back to 
me. “First of all”, he said, “if you can learn a simple trick, 
Scout, you’ll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. 
You never really understand a person until you consider 
things from his point of view-” “Sir?” “-until you climb into 
his skin and walk around in it”. “But if I keep on goin’ 
to school, we can’t ever read any more…” “That’s really 
bothering you, isn’t it?” “Yes sir.”

When Atticus looked down at me I saw the expression 
bargain: an agreement between 

on his face that always made me expect something. “Do you two or more people as to what 
know what a compromise is?”, he asked. “Bending the law?” each will do for the other

“No, an agreement reached by mutual concessions. It works 
this way”, he said. “If you’ll concede the necessity of going 
to school, we’ll go on reading every night just as we always 
have. Is it a bargain?”

“Yes sir!”
“We’ll consider it sealed without the usual formality”, 

Atticus said, when he saw me preparing to spit.
As I opened the front screen door Atticus said, “By the disapprobation: strong moral 

way, Scout, you’d better not say anything at school about disapproval
our agreement”. “Why not?” “I’m afraid our activities would 
be received with considerable disapprobation by the more 
learned authorities.”

My brother and I were accustomed to our father’s 
diction, and we were at all times free to interrupt Atticus for a 
translation when it was beyond our understanding. “Huh, Sir?”

“I never went to school”, he said, “but I have a feeling 
that if you tell Miss Caroline we read every night she’ll get 
after me, and I wouldn’t want her after me”.

Text I
The World as I See It

In my opinion, the present symptoms of decadence are 
explained by the fact that the development of industry and 
machinery has made the struggle for existence very much 
more severe, greatly to the detriment of the free development 
of the individual. But the development of machinery means decadence: moral or 
that less and less work is needed from the individual for the cultural decline as 

characterised by excessive 
satisfaction of the community’s needs. A planned division indulgence in pleasure or 
of labour is becoming more and more of a crying necessity luxury 
and this division will lead to the material security of the 
individual. This security and the spare time and energy detriment: the state of 
which the individual will have at his command can be made being harmed or damaged

to further his development. In this way the community may 
regain its health, and we will hope that future historians will 
explain the morbid symptoms of present-day society as the 
childhood ailments of an aspiring humanity, due entirely to 
the excessive speed at which civilisation was advancing.

the terror of the whole countryside. He lived by plundering 
travellers and feared no one. He had committed many 
murders. All attempts to capture the inhuman Angulimala 
had failed. So he continued his crimes unpunished. The 
people of Kosala pleaded with the Buddha not to expose 
himself to the dangers of the robber’s territory. 

But Gautama Buddha knew no fear. The warnings of the 
people of Kosala did not affect him. He made his way into 
the jungle. Angulimala got enraged at this boldness. He was

confident and in control of calm and self-possessed, and heard his words of kindness, 
one’s feelings

the robber hesitated. His arm, which had been uplifted to kill, 
fell helpless by his side. His wrath cooled, and he knelt down 
before the Buddha. He confessed all his sins and declared his 
faith in the Buddha. When the people saw the new disciple 
following his Master, they were amazed and could not believe 
that this was the ferocious man who had been a terror for 
so long. Angulimala became a monk. His past was forgotten, 
and he was widely respected for his holiness.

Text I
THE MIRACULOUS ESCAPE 
I had been very wealthy and prosperous and was leading 
a very comfortable life. I had all the worldly pleasures with 
me. But soon I became bored of my idle life. The urge to go 
on a voyage became stronger and stronger day by day. It 
haunted me like anything. So one day I boarded a ship and 
went trading from island to island with other merchants.

When we started, the weather was fine and the sea was 
calm. But on the fourth day of our voyage, our ship was 
caught in a terrific/terrible hurricane and we wandered 
from our set course. The tempest continued for several 
days and drove us near an island. The captain of the ship

was reluctant to cast anchor at the port as it was a much 
dreaded place. 

The violent waves of the sea had exhausted us. We were 
all tired and hungry so we went in search of food and water. 
We were fortunate enough to find fruit trees and a stream of 
fresh and cool water which gave us strength and energy and 
relieved us from hunger. 

rustle: make a soft, muffled It had started getting dark. As we were tired we went to 
crackling sound like that sleep but were soon startled by a rustling noise which came 
caused by the movement of from a very long and huge python like serpent gliding swiftly 
dry leaves or paper

towards us. We ran to save our lives but the serpent was 
quick enough to swallow one of my companions. We kept 
running till we had covered a good enough distance from the 
serpent. We felt a bit relieved but at the same time sad as we 
had lost a friend of ours. We took shelter on the top of a tree 
and thought ourselves to be safe.

But we were mistaken for we had hardly slept a little 
alarm: a warning of danger time when we heard a hissing sound which alarmed and 

frightened us. Coiling itself round the tree, the serpent 
reached my other companion who was positioned somewhat 
lower than me on the tree. It swallowed him and went away. 
Terror stricken I clung to the branch of the tree tightly 
and I did not know when I fell asleep. It was daylight when 
I awoke. I climbed down. It seemed to me that I had no 
courage left. It took me no time to realise that if I would not 
think of a way to escape soon, I would be a dead man. It was 
just a matter of time when I would also be swallowed like my 
two other companions. The instinct to prevent one’s life is 
greater than any fear or frustration.     

I thought I should spare no means to save myself. I 
collected a lot of dry wood and bushes and tied them into a 
bundle with reeds. I arranged them in a circular structure 
round the tree and tied some of them with the branches of 
the tree. In this way I made a tent like structure in which 

penetrate: force a way into I sat after dusk and securely tied from within. I had the 
or through satisfaction that whatever I could do I did it to prevent 

myself. This time when the serpent arrived he crept round 
the tree but he could not penetrate the defensive structure I 
had made around me. It just sat and waited the whole night 
like a cat that waits for the mouse to emerge out of its hole.

At dawn the serpent crept back but I dared not come 
out of my fortress. I lay there half dead and almost 
suffocated.

When the Sun began to shine, I came out of my wooden 
fortress. I was so desperate that I ran towards the seashore. wildly: uncontrolled; 

When I was about to jump into the sea, I saw a ship sailing unrestrained; very

waved it too, which attracted the sailors on the ship and 
a rescue boat was immediately sent for me. This was my 
miraculous escape from the deadly serpent.

The Dog and His Bone Notes

A hungry dog while searching about food found a bone. He 
picked it out and held it tightly in his mouth and ran out into 
the woods, to a safe place to enjoy it in ease.  He growled and 
frowned at anyone who attempted to take it over. He chewed 
the bone for a very long time and this made him quite thirsty. 
He came to a stream to quench his thirst. He trotted around 
the footbridge and happened to glance into the water. He footbridge: a bridge for

dog with a bigger bone, he growled and scowled towards 
it. The reflection growled and scowled back. Being greedy 
by nature, he wanted that bone too. He snapped his sharp 
teeth at the image on the water.  He barked at the other dog, 
hoping to scare him into giving that bone. His own big bone 
fell with a splash, went over of sight, the moment he opened 
his mouth to bite!

Shrawan Kumar, a six-year old boy, was playing in his 
house at a distance of about 200 feet.  Seeing smoke coming 
out from Jhalaram’s house, he ran towards it. He saw the 
children sitting on a cot and screaming for help, and the 
goats caught in the flames.  

Shrawan entered the house, lifted the younger child in 
one arm and pulling the older one by the hand, brought 
them out safely.  He took them to his house, then ran to 
inform his father and the children’s father.  

The elders rushed to the site.  But by that time, the goats 
had died and the household belongings had been destroyed 
in the fire.  It was Shrawan Kumar’s daring act that saved 
the lives of the two children.

Reading Comprehension Notes

Read the following passages and answer the questions that 
follow.
Text I
I must have been about seven when my father left Porbandar 
for Rajkot to become a member of the Rajasthanik Court. 
There I was put into a primary school, and I can well recollect 
those days, including the names and other particulars of the 
teachers who taught me. As at Porbandar, so here, there is 
hardly anything to note about my studies. I could only have 
been a mediocre student. From this school I went to the 
suburban school and thence to high school, having already 
reached my twelfth year. I do not remember having ever 
told a lie, during this short period, either to my teachers 
or to my school-mates. However, I used to be very shy and 
avoided all company. My books and my lessons were my sole 
companions. To be at school at the stroke of the hour and 
to run back home as soon as the school closed — that was 
my daily habit. There is an incident which occurred at the 
examination during my first year at high school and which 
is worth recording. Mr Giles, the educational Inspector, had 
come on a visit of inspection. He had set us five words to prompt: cause someone to 
write as a spelling exercise. One of the words was ‘Kettle’. take a course of action

I had misspelt it. The teacher tried to prompt me with the 
point of his boot, but I would not be prompted. It was beyond 
me to see that he wanted me to copy the spelling from my 
neighbour’s slate, for I had thought that the teacher was 
there to supervise us against copying. The result was that 
all the boys, except myself, were found to have spelt every 
word correctly. I could never learn the art of ‘copying’. Yet 
the incident did not in the least diminish my respect for my 
teacher. I was by nature, blind to the faults of elders. Later 
I came to know of many other failings of this teacher, but 
my regard for him remained the same. Two other incidents 
belonging to the same period have always clung to my 
memory. As a rule I had distaste for any reading beyond 
my school books. The daily lessons had to be done, because deceive: give a mistaken 
I disliked being taken to task by my teacher as much as I impression

disliked deceiving him. Therefore I would do the lessons,

Notes but often without my mind in them. Thus, when even the 
lessons could not be done properly, there was of course no 
question of any extra reading. But somehow my eyes fell on 
a book purchased by my father. It was Shravana Pitribhakti 
Nataka. I read it with intense interest. One of the pictures I 
was shown was of Shravana carrying, by means of slings fitted

Indra Krishnamurthy Nooyi is an Indian American business 
executive. She is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
of Pepsico. She is one among the world’s most powerful 
women. She delivered the following speech at the Rashtrapati 
Bhawan on 14 December 2013. She was named one of the 
25 Greatest Living Legends by NDTV, and was awarded 
by the then President of India, Pranab Mukherjee at the 
Rashtrapati Bhawan.
Read the speech delivered by Indra Nooyi and answer the 
questions that follow.

Mr President and NDTV, thank you very much for this 
incredible honour.

Malcom Gladwell in his book, Outliers says: “Who you 
are cannot be separated from where you came from.”

I left India 35 years ago, went to the USA and had 
meritocracy: a ruling or tremendous success in the meritocracy. But none of that 
influential class of educated could have happened if I would not have had wonderful 
or able people upbringing very much here in India. So I have a lot to 

thank India for. Now my three lessons I would like to share 
with you.

First, please be a lifelong student. You know when we 
were kids, we used to ask questions like “Why is the sky 
blue?”, “Why the birds flying so high?” But for some reasons, 
as we get older, that curiosity goes away. And if we are 

atrophy: gradual decline in 
effectiveness or vigour due happy with the knowledge we have, then we are actually 
to underuse or neglect going to atrophy. So, please remain a lifelong student, don’t 

lose that curiosity.
Second, whatever you do, throw yourself into it, throw 

your head, heart and hands into it. I look at my job not as a

the hours, about the hardships, because to me everything is 
a joy. So whatever you do, please look upon it as a Calling, a 
Passion, not as a job, not as something temporary. Fun fact

On 3 August 1996, Leander Paes became the first Indian

gusto: enjoyment and Fernando Meligeni of Brazil in an exciting match in the 
enthusiasm Centennial Olympic Games at Atlanta. Paes ranked 31 places 

below the Brazilian, played with gusto and determination 
against a player who has two ATP tour titles under his belt, 
and clinched the bronze medal. He was given a standing

Unit 7.indd   96 20-02-2023   09:25:57



ovation when Paes raised his hand in triumph and said a 
silent prayer.

Leander’s father had won a bronze medal in the Munich 
Olympics 1972 as a member of the Indian hockey team. It is 
creditable to Leander Paes as he got it in an individual event.

Later he dedicated the medal to his coach and his 
doubles teammate. “They have helped me out and given 
me advice and kept me in good frame of mind. This medal 
doesn’t just show my efforts; it shows the efforts of the whole 
team.”

Paes was recognised as a prodigy by Vijay Amritraj in prodigy: a young person 
the ’80s. Even so, Paes’ true mentor has been Naresh Kumar, with exceptional qualities or 

the former Indian Davis Cup Captain. His incredible Davis abilities

Cup record speaks for itself. While it may be said that some expatriate: a person who

support. But at Atlanta, Paes had none of these advantages 
except his coach, close family members and the expatriates. 
While Davis Cup victories bring in good cash rewards and 
ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) points, there he 
was playing for just a medal. Paes explains it all when he 
says, “When I am playing for my country I don’t expect 
anything.” That straightaway sets him apart.

He succeeds because of his willingness to take his 
chances, swift reflexes and mental strength, and the fact 
that he does not accept defeat easily.

Where the Mind is Without Fear
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;
Where knowledge is free;
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
By narrow domestic walls;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards 

       perfection;
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way

4.	 An idiomatic expression is a group of words with a 
special meaning. The individual words in the expression 
do not mean what they otherwise stand for.

Example: Maria Sharapova cannot be ‘pigeon-holed’ or 
categorised. Her talent, unwavering desire to succeed 
and readiness to sacrifice have lifted her to the top of 
the world.

Here pigeon-holed does not mean that there is a hole 
for the pigeon to its nest. But it means that someone 
or something belongs to a particular type or group; is 
categorised, especially without knowing much about them.

Now, consult a dictionary and match the following 
idiomatic expressions given in Column ‘A’ with their 
meanings in Column ‘B’.

Listening

Your teacher or a classmate will read the excerpt given 
below. Listen to it carefully and answer the questions.

Harvard-MIT researcher, Hugh Herr, is familiar with 
amputate: cut off (a limb) by the obstacles faced by amputees. A world-class mountain 
surgical operation climber at the age of 17, Herr and a friend were trapped 

in a snowstorm while ascending New Hampshire’s Mount 
Washington in 1982. After three days without food or 
camping gear, the two were rescued, but frostbite cost 

frostbite: injury to body Herr both his legs, which were amputated just below 
tissues caused by exposure the knee. Herr was fitted with prostheses, but he soon 
to extreme old, typically 
affecting the nose, fingers, discovered that they were developed for walking on flat 
or toes surfaces, and not for taking on advanced functions like 
prosthesis: an artificial body climbing or running. With the same determination that 
part, such as a limb he once applied to climbing, he set out to create a better 

prosthetic leg. He worked with an engineering shop to 
tinkering: an act of fashion his own prostheses, tinkering with customised 
attempting to repair sockets and lighter materials. He even designed artificial 
something

feet specially made for climbing rock (built flat and 
narrow for getting a toehold in cracks and ice featuring 
sharp spikes).

“I experienced a tremendous amount of pain from 
prosthetic limbs at first”, Herr says. “So I decided to go back 
to school and learn about physics and engineering to try to 
solve these problems.” Herr obtained a Master’s degree in 
mechanical engineering from MIT in 1993 and a doctorate 
in biophysics from Harvard five years later.

After struggling for a decade to come up with a better 
prosthetic limb, just getting the knee to market will be 
a personal triumph for Herr  —  yet another mountain 
conquered. “It’s been a long road”, he says. “But I think I’m 
finally in a position to make a difference.”

Reading Comprehension

Read the following passage and answer the questions that 
follow.
Text I
When we think of tourism, we think primarily of people who 
are visiting a particular place for sightseeing, visiting friends 
and relatives, taking a vacation, and having a good time. They 
may spend their leisure time engaging in various sports, 
sunbathing, talking, singing, taking rides, touring, reading 
or simply enjoying further. We may include in our definition 
of tourism people who are participating in a convention, 
a business conference, or some other kind of business or 
professional activity. Those who are taking a study tour under 
an expert guide or doing some kind of scientific research or 
study are also doing tourism. These visitors use all forms of 
transportation from hiking in a wilderness park to flying in chairlift: a series of chairs 
a jet to an exciting city. Transportation can include taking a hanging from a moving 

chairlift up a Colorado mountainside or standing at the rail cable, for carrying people up 
and down a mountain

of a cruise ship looking across the blue Caribbean. Whether 
people travel by one of these means or by car, motor coach 
camper, train, motorbike or bicycle, they are taking a trip 
and thus are engaging in tourism.

Charles R. Goeldner and J.R. Brent Ritchie, p. 4)

A little after noon on that distinguished Saturday 
I reached the ship and went on board. All was bustle 

pier: a long structure built and confusion. The pier was crowded with carriages and 
in the sea and joined to the 
land at one end men; passengers were arriving and hurrying on board; 

the vessel’s decks were encumbered with trunks and 
woebegone: very sad or valises; groups of excursionists, arrayed in unattractive 
miserable traveling costumes, were moping about in a drizzling 

rain and looking as droopy and woebegone as so many 
molting chickens. The gallant flag was up, but it was 
under the spell, too, and hung limp and disheartened by 
the mast. Altogether, it was the bluest, bluest spectacle!

Listening

Listen to the passage and answer the questions that follow.
A Visit to Bhitarkanika
The sun was warm but the sea breeze kept up its cooling 
effect all along. Soon the steamer turned away and anchored 
near a creek by the river. The muddy fringe and the mangrove creek: a narrow area of water 

where the sea flows into the 
vegetation declared the gateway to the Bhitarkanika Wildlife land
Sanctuary in Odisha. The steamer could not negotiate these 
creeks at low tide, so a similar motorboat was hired to ferry 
us to the Dangmal forest rest-house in the heart of the 
mangrove forest. From the motorboat we had a good look at 
a large crocodile basking in the sun.

The boat moved on, taking us deeper into the forest. 
Here we felt as though we had stepped into a time warp. In plumage: the feathers 
this awesome and mysterious place, birds of extraordinary covering a bird’s body

plumage appeared before us. For the moment we revelled 
in the magnificence of nature which had us completely in 
its thrall. Among the birds, the kingfishers were the stars of 
the show. Crocodiles, large and small, slid into the water at 
our approach. Through the foliage we could see chital deer 
delicately browsing on fresh outcrops of leaves.

A herd of wild boar was spotted searching for succulent 
brooding silence: mysterious 

roots. High above us, open-billed storks stood sentry-like silence
following our progress through their remarkable kingdom. 
The evening sun was beginning to paint the tree-lined horizon 
crimson and gold and a brooding silence enveloped us all.

Interview with a Detective
His appearance was clean, cool and deliberately ambiguous. 
Under the sanctuary of his aviators, his eyes silently scanned 
the room. He is a Manhattan-based, third-generation private 
detective who’s been in the business for more than three 
decades — specialising in surveillance and being an overall 
mystery-tinged badass. We asked him everything we’ve ever 
wanted to know about the profession.

Interviewer	 :	 So, what exactly do you do? Notes
Detective	 :	 I do a lot of surveillance. Basically, 

someone who wonders, “What is this 
other person up to?” If it’s insurance 
company (surveying someone on 
workers’ compensation), they’ll ask, “Is 
he back working?” Things like that.

		  Another very common request is 
locating people, and it could be for a lot surveillance: close 

observation, especially of a 
of reasons. I had a case recently, a man suspected spy or criminal
hadn’t been in touch with his mother for 
20 years and I helped him find her.

Interviewer	 :	 What kind of skills make for a good PI 
(Private Investigator)?

Detective	 :	 Patience — Number one. You have to 
pay attention. You have to be the kind 
of person, if you sit in front of a door 
watching it for six hours, and you haven’t 
seen your guy.

		  You have to plan accordingly, and be 
willing to make sacrifices in order to stay 
out there. It’s not a job for people who 
want to slack off.

Interviewer	 :	 If you needed to locate someone, what’s 
the ideal information you need to start?

Detective	 :	 Usually, this is what I tell people, “If you 
want to find someone, I need the name 
with the exact spelling, the DOB if you 
know it, the social security number, DOB: Date of Birth

and a last known, official address where 
they’ve lived within the past 15 years.” 
Because that means they’ll be in our 
database.

Interviewer	 :	 Do most private investigators have a 
relationship with local police? 

Detective	 :	 I would say that’s kind of a myth. Most 
cops wouldn’t even do it in the first 
place, because they know how serious a 
violation it is.

Interviewer	 :	 Do most private eyes carry guns?
Detective	 :	 I don’t think so. We don’t kill people but 

help them.

Listen to the story of Shibi Rana and answer the questions 
that follow.
There are many stories in our mythology when gods have 
disguised themselves in the forms of human beings, birds, 
etc. This is done either to test the efficiency and ability of 
the kings or to see if people are happy and contented on 
earth. This is another aspect of changing the identity. Let us 
listen to story of King Shibi.

There was a great king, Shibi Rana who had immense 
power then, even gods in heavens were amazed. They feared 
that Shibi might take away their kingdoms. They devised a 
plan to test his sense of justice. So they decided to reach 
Shibi’s kingdom in disguise.

One day, Shibi Rana was sitting on his throne. His 
courtroom was surrounded by majestic gardens. There 
came a scared dove flying to him and it was followed 
by a fierce looking eagle. The king gave shelter to the 
dove and saved her. The eagle argued that the king has 
taken away his food — the dove. It would starve. The king 

magnanimous: generous or 
forgiving, especially towards assured the eagle that he would give equal quantity of
