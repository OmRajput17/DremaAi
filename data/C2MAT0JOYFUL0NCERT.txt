different animal shadows on
the wall with their fingers.
You can also try to make the
shadows.

puppetry art form practised in Karnataka. The puppets are used
to depict scenes from Indian epics. Let children also share their
experiences of watching a puppet show.

train in India. The train is
designed in India only and
is also India's first train to
have an integrated engine
and not a separate engine

Let us Play - Knowing Direction
Ask a child to volunteer from the class. Blindfold him or her.
Give directions to the blindfolded child to move from one spot to
another (for example, move from the last bench to the blackboard).
For directions use these words only-right, left, or straight.
The game will go on for 5-7 rounds with different children
volunteering themselves. Ask the children to decide a safe
word like 'danger' when one is about to get hit by objects in the
classroom.
(To increase the difficulty level, you may change the setting of
the classroom or keep harmless hurdles on the way).
