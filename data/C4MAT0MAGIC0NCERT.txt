Shapes Around Us

Diksha wanted to go to a big city
during her summer holidays.
Her father took her to Delhi
and they visited many old and
new interesting monuments like
the India Gate, Qutub Minar,
Safdarjung Tomb, Akshardham,
the National Museum, Jantar
Mantar and Sansad Bhawan.
Now she is trying to make a model
of India Gate using her wooden
blocks.
Try to make a model of the buildings
shown here using blocks.
1. What parts of the building have you shown in your model
(for example, roof, pillars, base, etc.)?
2. Why did you select these parts?
3. What shapes will model these parts well?______________
4. How is your model similar to the picture of the real building?
__________________
5. How is it different from the real building? ______________
Discussion: What would happen if you removed one piece of your model?
• Would the model still look like the original building?
• In what ways could you make the model even better?

Project Work
Encourage learners to observe a
street carefully and make a model
showing the main buildings on
the street.

I have made something. Look
at my Qutub Minar.
Do you think it looks like the Qutub Minar?...................
What shape would you use if you made a model of the Qutub
Minar? Why?...............…………………………….
How many such shapes will you use? ............................
Do you know: The Qutub Minar is
a World Heritage site and the tallest
building made up of bricks. It has 5
storeys and 379 stairs.
Earlier, people made buildings with clay bricks, stone blocks
or wood. Today we also use concrete blocks, hollow blocks, etc.
What is common to all of these bricks? ………..

Note for Teachers: Ask learners to collect different boxes, bottles, cans, coconut
shells, etc., to model the given buildings.

1. Make a sphere-like shape with paper strips.
Diksha has folded open and
flattened a box to see what an
open box looks like. This is
called the net of the box. If you
fold along the dotted lines, you
will get the box back.

When Lines Meet
Isha made different corners with straws. We can
say that the two straws are like two lines
that meet at a point.
When two lines meet they create an
angle.
We see many angles in yoga postures.

There are 7 angles in this house
drawing.

How many angles are there in this
boat drawing?

Shapes with Straws
Make a triangle with straws
of different sizes and clay/
plasticine.
Does the shape of the triangle
change if we gently push one of
its sides?
Yes/No
Trace the triangles you made with
the straws in your notebook.
What kinds of angles does a triangle have?
Make a rectangular shape with straws and clay.
What kinds of angles do you see in the
rectangle?..................
Does the shape of the rectangle change if we gently push one of its
sides?
Yes/No

What has happened to the angles of the new shape?
Are they still right angles? What types of angles have been formed?
Similarly, push one side of a square.
Are they still right angles? What types of angles have been formed?
How are the angles of triangles and rectangles similar or different?

Note for Teachers: Help children to understand the rigidity of different
shapes. The triangle is the most rigid shape, as it does not change its shape
when pushed.

As we have learnt in Grade 3, the Indian system of writing numbers,
which we have been learning and practising in school to write and add
and subtract numbers, was discovered in India around 2000 years
ago, and is now used around the world. This system was designed so
that we can write all numbers, no matter how large they are, using
just the ten symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
Till now, we have learnt how to write all numbers from 1 to 999. Now
let us explore how to write numbers one thousand and larger in the
Indian number system!
You remember that Gulnaz and Jaspreet had kept track of the people
who came for the community lunch.
Let us see how they did it.

1000s AROUND US

The Thousand Pillars Temple, or
Saavira Kambada Basadi, is the most
famous among the 18 Jain temples
in Moodubidiri town, Karnataka.
Built in the 1500s by the local
ruler Devaraya Wadiyar, each of its
thousand pillars is decorated with
unique rock carvings.
Did you know?
In the early 1900s, the population of the Indian rhinoceros was
driven to near extinction, with only around 200 rhinoceros
left. With recent conservation efforts, there are around 4000
(four thousand) rhinoceroses.
It weighs between 1800 kg (one
thousand eight hundred and 2700
kg (two thousand seven hundred),
is around 2 m high/tall and
more than 3 m long. The Indian
rhinoceros is the state animal
of Assam.
My country
India is a country with a rich cultural heritage. It has 788
districts. These districts are divided into about six lakh villages,
each with its own unique traditions and practices. India has over
7500 kilometres (Seven thousand five hundred) of coastline on
three sides. Our country’s history goes back over 5000 years (Five
thousand), and we celebrate more than 1000 festivals.

Note for Teachers: Give learners the experience of grouping and regrouping in 1s,
10s, and 100s. The following pages have some examples of tasks to engage learners.
Zoltán Pál Dienes was a Hungarian mathematician and educator who developed
Dienes blocks. These blocks represent different numerical values, and help students
understand the idea of the Indian base-10 place value system of writing numbers
and carrying out arithmetic operations on them.

writing all numbers, however large. Also, draw their attention to the order in which
we read and write—first Thousand, then Hundred, then Tens, and finally Ones.
(2A&2B). This exercise is to check that students understand the importance of units.
2 Hundreds is always more than 2 Tens or 2 Hundreds is more than 9 Tens.

Sharing and
Measuring

PARTS AND WHOLES
Ikra and her little sister, Samina, decide to make a drawing, but they
are left with a single drawing sheet. Ikra wants to share the paper by
dividing it in half, but Samina insists on having a bigger part of the
paper. Ikra thought for a moment and proposed a solution.
Would you like half of the paper to
draw, or two quarters of the paper?
One half paper seems smaller, but two quarters
sounds like a bigger part. I want two quarters!

One Quarter
One Half
One Quarter

Let Us Discuss
1. Which part of the paper you would have chosen—one half or two
quarters? Why?
2. Do you think Ikra shared the paper equally? Why? Try with a paper.
3. How do you know that the paper has been divided equally?
4. Why do you think Samina chose two quarters of the paper?

Chapter 5.indd 62

3/25/2025 11:56:05 AM

Let Us Do
1. Samina has divided some figures into two parts. Colour the figures
that are divided into halves correctly. How did you get the answer?

2. Divide the shapes into halves by drawing a line.

When an object is divided into two
equal parts, then each part is called
a half. We write half as 1 .
2

63

Chapter 5.indd 63

3/25/2025 11:56:08 AM

3. Divide these shapes into 4 equal parts/quarters.
When an object is
divided into four
equal parts, then
each part is called
a quarter.
We write quarter
as 1 .
4

Think: How would we write the fraction for each part if
we divided an object into 5 equal parts?

Many Ways to Make Halves and Quarters
Let Us Try
1. In how many different ways can you fold/cut a rectangular paper in
two equal parts? Try it with a rectangular paper.

Note for Teachers: Guide students to write fractions using symbols. Begin
1
with examples like 1
2 and 4 . Provide numerous opportunities for practice
with other fractions by paper folding and drawing images.

Measuring Length

Let Us Observe

1. Look at the picture. What are the students measuring? Put a tick
mark () if you find it being measured.
a) Length

c) Weight

e) Breadth

b) Height

d) Depth

f) Temperature

2. What is being used to measure the height? What other tools can be
used to measure height?
3. Recall in Grade 3 you studied that lengths are measured in
metres. Check and fill in the blanks whether the following are
correct/incorrect for your classroom.
a) The height of most of the students in my grade is more than a
metre. _______________
b) The length of my arm is less than a metre. _______________
c) The height of the door of the grade is less than a metre. __________
d) The breadth of the blackboard is more than a metre.___________
Note for Teachers: The words tall, wide, short and long are used in daily life. Discuss
with students that height, width, depth, breadth all refer to length measurement.
These words are used depending on different situations and orientation. At this point
students only need to understand that all these words denote length.

Let Us Do
Use your ropes to carry out the following activities. You can use a
combination of ropes, if needed.
1. Walk, Jump, and Crawl on 1, 5 and 10 m line
Draw lines of 1 m, 5 m, and 10 m on the floor of the classroom or outside
in the playground.
How will you make these lines? Think and share with your friends.
Walk, jump, and crawl on the lines.
Note for Teachers: Making the lines by repeatedly using metre rope and walking,
jumping and crawling on the lines will help students develop an estimate of how big
5 m and 10 m is. They will be able to use this experience to estimate and compare
other lengths in their surroundings.

Measuring Small Things
Can you think how to measure a small thing
like an eraser or a rice grain?
1 cm

We need a smaller unit to measure such small items. Observe a standard
metre scale. You can see the scale is divided into 100 equal parts.
The length of each one of these parts has a special name called
Centimetre (cm).

Let Us Observe
Chutki wants to keep track of the increase
in height of her plant.
Compare the metre rope with the measuring tape
used by a tailor. Is the length of both the same or
different?
Observe the measuring tape carefully. What do you notice?

is 1 cm.

The red bar is repeated 10 times to make 10 cm. When we repeat the
length of the red bar 100 times, we will get 1 metre scale/tape.
1 metre (m) = 100 centimetre (cm)
1 m = _____ cm,

3. Take three toy cars and find out how far each one can
go. You can use a small wooden ramp, or you might
like to make a ramp using any material that you have.
Measure the distance each of your cars travels using measuring tape
and write the answers in cm.
Car

Note for Teachers: Get a one metre measuring scale or measuring tape for the
students to observe. Make students observe the marks and the numbers written
on the tape. Discuss what 100 denotes on the tape. Students often assume it is the
number of marks on the tape. Highlight that the distance between two marks is
one centimetre (1 cm) and one metre is divided into 100 such 1 cm distances. After
students have made such observations, children can use the measuring tape/scale
to measure small lengths.

Bhola is making a boundary with bricks for his
vegetable garden. Colour the bricks on the boundary.
How many bricks will he need to make the boundary?

The length of the
boundary of an object
or shape is called
perimeter.

Note for Teachers: Help children understand that perimeter is the length of the
boundary of a closed figure that can be measured using various non-formal units,
such as footsteps, thumbprints, and block printing. Such measures are generally
approximate but measuring using formal units with a scale or measuring tape would
be more accurate.

Note for Teachers: Learners can use the concrete materials first before doing the
algorithm. You should communicate that while computing using an algorithm we
start from the ones place and then move to tens, hundreds and so on. When there
are not enough ones to take away, then we need to regroup the 1 Ten to 10 Ones.

Note for Teachers: Division problems are of 2 types—share and measure. In
share problems, the number of equal groups is given (i.e the multiplier) leading to
opportunities to share objects equally. The example above is a share problem. In
measure problems, the size of each group is given (i.e, the multiplicand), like when
we ask how many ants are there if the number of legs is 60. Including both kinds
of problems is helpful for children.

Fun with
Symmetry

In previous grades, we have explored symmetry in rangolis, masks, bead
strings and in buildings.
Let us explore more about symmetry.

Let Us Do
1. Ink Design
Step 1: Take a sheet of paper and fold it in half.

Step 2: Open it and sprinkle some drops of water
colours in the centre of the fold.

Step 3: Press it to spread the colour evenly.

Step 4: Look what you made!

Is it a symmetrical pattern?
Where would you draw the line that divides this design
into two equal halves?
Isn’t this line called the line of
symmetry? I made it while making
masks and rangolis in Grade 3 too.

b) How many lines of symmetry can you see in Fig. 8?
c) Where will you place a mirror to see the reflection of the right half
side of Fig. 8? Will it look the same as the left half side?
d) Fly the plane.
e) Will the plane fly if there is no line of symmetry?
f) Try to make an asymmetrical plane.
g) Fly both the planes and see which plane flies for a
longer time.
h) Share your observations with your friends.

Mini has made this design by folding and cutting paper.

Now it’s your turn! Take a square sheet of paper.
Do as instructed below.
Let us see what Rani is making. Rani takes a
piece of paper and folds it twice.

She makes a straight cut at the corner and cuts out two
squares on two sides as shown in the picture.

Challenge 1: Where would the hole and cut appear when
you open the paper?
Challenge 2: Fold a piece of paper once; put two
cuts in the middle as shown. How many sides will
this shape have when you open the folded paper?

Challenge 3: Fold a paper twice. Where would you cut to
make a square hole in the center of the paper? How many
cuts are required?

Chapter 11.indd 169

3/26/2025 3:52:44 PM

5. Observe the shapes. How many sides does each shape have?
How many lines of symmetry does each shape have? You may trace
these shapes and check the lines of symmetry by folding the shapes.

Tiling the Tiles
Here are some patterns with tiles. Identify the repeating unit (tile) and
continue the patterns.

Note for Teachers: Let the students realise that just by changing the position and
colour, different tiles can be created. Here, students may identify different repeating
units as tiles. Let the students use terms, such as sliding, flipping, rotating, standing,
sleeping, etc. Students may also see a group of 8 rectangles as a repeating unit.

Bablu Chacha makes beautiful tiles of the kinds shown below. Design
creative tiles of your own in the spaces given below. You may use a
rangometry kit or shape cutouts.

1. Which shapes have you used to make the tiles?
2. Which of the tiles are symmetrical? Draw the lines of symmetry (if
any).
3. Make more tiles by joining two or more shapes. Trace them in your
notebook to create paths with no gaps or overlaps.

What do you notice? Discuss.

Let Us Do
1. Make floor patterns with your tile. Mini has made
a floor pattern as shown below.
Remember there should be no overlaps and no
gaps.

Note for Teachers: Encourage students to ask questions about the two designs. For
example, how many shapes have been used? Would the design look the same if only
one colour is used? Encourage children to create different designs using the same
shapes with different colours.

Let us go on a nature walk (Project time)

Wow! Look at these leaves,
they too look symmetrical.
Look! That butterfly is so
symmetrical.

Go for a nature walk to a nearby park or around your school with your
teacher or your parents. Observe the patterns, designs, or symmetry
around you carefully. Collect leaves, petals, and flowers that have fallen
on the ground.
In your project file:
• Categorise the leaves into symmetrical and non-symmetrical.
• Make different designs and patterns with leaves and flowers.
• Make a greeting card using imprints of leaves or dry flowers.
• Create animals or designs using leaves and flowers.

14 × 300 = _______

23 × 200 = _______

7 × 800 = _______

Note for Teachers: Encourage students to understand the multiplication of a number
times-100 by splitting the number of groups in suitable ways. For example, 18 × 100
= 18 Hundreds = 10 Hundreds and 8 Hundreds, that is, 1800. Also, children should
be encouraged to see relationships in the answers to two different multiplication
problems like the ones above, for example, changing the group size from 100 to 200
or changing the number of groups from 11 to 22.

Amala is fascinated to read this information in the aeroplane section of
the transport museum.
“During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian Government undertook
a massive evacuation of Indians living outside the country, under a
mission called Vande Bharat. In the first week, 64 f lights carried 152
people each.”
Note for Teachers: Encourage students to understand the patterns in the above
problems. Relationships between doubles and halves and multiplication by 10s and
100s should be pointed out.

Note for Teachers
Box diagrams help students decode word problems as well as find
strategies to solve them. The following examples are typical of all word
problems in addition and subtraction. The operation that needs to
be carried out can be decided depending on which boxes are filled in
any problem. The three types of problems are combine, compare and
change. Each problem can be represented using a slightly different
box diagram so that one can capture the problem fully.
Example 1: Combine: Involves two different sets/collections. For
example, there are 343 children in the Preparatory Stage and 532 in
the Middle Stage in a school. How many total children are there in
these two stages?
343 + 532 = ?

?
343

532

Example 2: Change: Involves change in an existing set/quantity. For
example, I have 445 in my piggy bank. After three months, I ended
up with 800 in the bank. How much has the amount in my bank
increased in three months?
445 + ? = 800
800 – 445 = ?

445

?

800

Example 3: Change: There are some potatoes in Sohan’s shop. He
bought 150 kg more and now has 500 kg of fresh and old potatoes.
How many kg of potatoes did he have initially?
? + 150 = 500
500 – 150 = ?

?

+150

500

Example 4: Compare: Involves comparing two quantities. For example,
Anu is 6 years older than her sister Mini. Anu is 8 years old now. How
old is Mini?
8=?+6

Anu: 8 yrs old
Mini ?
