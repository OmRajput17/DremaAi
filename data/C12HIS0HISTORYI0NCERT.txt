FOREWORD

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on
the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They
also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures
will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred
system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).

The success of this effort depends on the steps that school
principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on
their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.
We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children
generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on
to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis
of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and
sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is
possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning,
not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and
mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary
as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The
methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how
effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a
happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus
designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by
restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with
greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for
teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving
higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and
wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-
on experience.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training
(NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development
committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson
of the advisory group in Social Sciences Professor Hari Vasudevan
and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor Neeladri Bhattacharya,
Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi
for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed
to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals
for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and

organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their

members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the
Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human
Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal

and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOKS

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce
content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020,
also emphasises reducing the content load and providing
opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In
this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to
rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes
already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken
into consideration in this exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the
following:

• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject
areas in the same class

• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the
same subject

• Difficulty level

• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children
through self-learning or peer-learning

• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying
out the changes given above.

DEFINING THE FOCUS OF STUDY

What defines the focus of this book? What does it seek to do? How
is it linked to what has been studied in earlier classes?

In Classes VI to VIII we looked at Indian history from early
beginnings to modern times, with a focus on one chronological
period in each year. Then in the books for Classes IX and X, the
frame of reference changed. We looked at a shorter period of time,
focusing specifically on a close study of the contemporary world.
We moved beyond territorial boundaries, beyond the limits of nation
states, to see how different people in different places have played
their part in the making of the modern world. The history of India
became connected to a wider inter-linked history. Subsequently in
Class XI we studied Themes in World History, expanding our
chronological focus, looking at the vast span of years from the
beginning of human life to the present, but selecting only a set of
themes for serious exploration. This year we will study Themes in
Indian History.

The book begins with Harappa and ends with the framing of the
Indian constitution. What it offers is not a general survey of five
millennia, but a close study of select themes. The history books in
earlier years have already acquainted you with Indian history. It is
time we explore some themes in greater detail.

In choosing the themes we have tried to ensure that we learn
about developments in different spheres – economic, cultural, social,
political, and religious – even as we attempt to break the boundaries
between them. Some themes in the book will introduce you to the
politics of the time and the nature of authority and power; others
explore the way societies are organised, and the way they function
and change; still others tell us about religious life and ritual
practices, about the working of economies, and the changes within
rural and urban societies.

Each of these themes will also allow you to have a closer look at
the historians’ craft. To retrieve the past, historians have to find
sources that make the past accessible. But sources do not just reveal
the past; historians have to grapple with sources, interpret them,
and make them speak. This is what makes history exciting. The
same sources can tell us new things if we ask new questions, and
engage with them in new ways. So we need to see how historians
read sources, and how they discover new things in old sources.

But historians do not only re-examine old records. They discover
new ones. Sometimes these could be chance discoveries.
Archaeologists may unexpectedly come across seals and mounds
that provide clues to the existence of a site of an ancient civilisation.
Rummaging through the dusty records of a district collectorate a
historian may trip over a bundle of records that contain legal cases
of local disputes, and these may open up a new world of village life
several centuries back. Yet are such discoveries only accidents? You
may bump into a bundle of old records in an archive, open it up
and see it, without discovering the significance of the source. The

Reprint 2025-26



viii

source may mean nothing to you unless you have relevant questions
in mind. You have to track the source, read the text, follow the clues,
and make the inter-connections before you can reconstruct the past.
The physical discovery of a record does not simply open up the
past. When Alexander Cunningham first saw a Harappan seal, he
could make no sense of it. Only much later was the significance of
the seals discovered.

In fact when historians begin to ask new questions, explore new
themes, they have to often search for new types of sources. If we
wish to know about revolutionaries and rebels, official sources can
reveal only a partial picture, one that will be shaped by official
censure and prejudice. We need to look for other sources – diaries
of rebels, their personal letters, their writings and pronouncements.
And these are not always easy to come by. If we have to understand
experiences of people, then oral sources might reveal more than
written sources.

As the vision of history broadens, historians begin tracking new
sources, searching for new clues to understand the past. And when
that happens, the conception of what constitutes a source itself
changes. There was a time when only written records were
acknowledged as authentic. What was written could be verified,
cited, and cross checked. Oral evidence was never considered a valid
source: who was to guarantee its authenticity and verifiability? This
mistrust of oral sources has not yet disappeared, but oral evidence
has been innovatively used to uncover experiences that no other
record could reveal.

Through the book this year, you will enter the world of historians,
accompany them in their search for new clues, and see how they
carry on their dialogues with the past. You will witness the way
they tease out meaning out of records, read inscriptions, excavate
archaeological sites, make sense of beads and bones, interpret the
epics, look at the stupas and buildings, examine paintings and
photographs, interpret police reports and revenue records, and
listen  to the voices of the past. Each theme will explore the
peculiarities and possibilities of one particular type of source. It
will discuss what a source can tell and what it cannot.

follow.

ONE The Harappan Civilisation

The Harappan seal (Fig.1.1) is possibly the most
distinctive artefact of the Harappan or Indus valley
civilisation. Made of a stone called steatite, seals
like this one often contain animal motifs and signs
from a script that remains undeciphered. Yet we
know a great deal about the lives of the people who
lived in the region from what they left behind –
their houses, pots, ornaments, tools and seals – in
other words, from archaeological evidence. Let us
see what we know about the Harappan civilisation,
and how we know about it. We will explore how
archaeological material is interpreted and how
interpretations sometimes change. Of course, there Fig. 1.1

are some aspects of the civilisation that are as yet A Harappan seal

unknown and may even remain so.

Terminologies, Places and Time
“The Harappan Civilisation” is also known as the Indus Valley

Civilisation. The term Harappa is derived from the place where
the civilization was identified. The total time span of the
civilisation ranges from 6000 BCE  to 1300 BCE. The early phase,
termed as Early Harappan (6000 BCE-2600 BCE) is a formative
phase of the civilisation. The urban phase of the civilisation,
termed as Mature Harappan (2600 BCE-1900 BCE) is the most
prosperous phase. The decline of the civilisation starts around
1900 BCE. This decadent phase (1900 BCE-1300 BCE) is termed
as Late Harappan.

The distinctive Harappan pottery, bricks (baked and unbaked)
seals, weights, beads, copper and bronze articles, belonging to the
Harappan civilisation have been found in the region, as apart as
Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Sind and Punjab provinces of Pakistan
and the Indian States of Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana,
Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra (Map 1).

4. Tracking Social Differences

4.1 Burials
Archaeologists generally use certain strategies to
find out whether there were social or economic
differences amongst people living within a particular
culture. These include studying burials. You are
probably familiar with the massive pyramids of
Egypt, some of which were contemporaneous with
the Harappan civilisation. Many of these pyramids
were royal burials, where enormous quantities of
wealth was buried.

At burials in Harappan sites the dead were
generally laid in pits. Sometimes, there were
differences in the way the burial pit was made – in
some instances, the hollowed-out spaces were lined
with bricks. Could these variations be an indication
of social differences? We are not sure.

Some graves contain pottery and ornaments,
perhaps indicating a belief that these could be used
in the afterlife. Jewellery has been found in burials
of both men and women. In fact, in the excavations
at the cemetery in Harappa in the mid-1980s, an
ornament consisting of three shell rings, a jasper Fig. 1.11
(a kind of semi-precious stone) bead and hundreds A copper mirror
of micro beads was found near the skull of a male.
In some instances the dead were buried with copper
mirrors. But on the whole, it appears that the
Harappans did not believe in burying precious things
with the dead.

4.2 Looking for “luxuries”
Another strategy to identify social differences is to
study artefacts, which archaeologists broadly Fig. 1.12

classify as utilitarian and luxuries. The first category A faience pot

includes objects of daily use made fairly easily out
of ordinary materials such as stone or clay. These
include querns, pottery, needles, flesh-rubbers (body
scrubbers), etc., and are usually found distributed
throughout settlements. Archaeologists assume
objects were luxuries if they are rare or made from
costly, non-local materials or with complicated
technologies. Thus, little pots of faience (a material
made of ground sand or silica mixed with colour
and a gum and then fired) were probably considered
precious because they were difficult to make.

Techniques for making beads differed according
to the material. Steatite, a very soft stone, was easily
worked. Some beads were moulded out of a paste
made with steatite powder. This permitted making a
variety of shapes, unlike the geometrical forms made
out of harder stones. How the steatite micro bead
was made remains a puzzle for archaeologists
studying ancient technology.

Archaeologists’ experiments have revealed that the
red colour of carnelian was obtained by firing the
yellowish raw material and beads at various stages
of production. Nodules were chipped into rough
shapes, and then finely flaked into the final form.
Grinding, polishing and drilling completed the
process. Specialised drills have been found at
Chanhudaro, Lothal and more recently at Dholavira.

12  THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY

Sometimes, larger waste pieces were used up to
make smaller objects, but minuscule bits were
usually left in the work area. These traces suggest
that apart from small, specialised centres, craft
production was also undertaken in large cities such
as Mohenjodaro and Harappa.

6. Strategies for Procuring
Materials

As is obvious, a variety of materials was used for
craft production. While some such as clay were
locally available, many such as stone, timber and
metal had to be procured from outside the alluvial
plain. Terracotta toy models of bullock carts suggest
that this was one important means of transporting
goods and people across land routes. Riverine routes
along the Indus and its tributaries, as well as coastal
routes were also probably used.

6.1 Materials from the subcontinent and beyond

The Harappans procured materials for craft
production in various ways. For instance, they
established settlements such as Nageshwar and
Balakot in areas where shell was available. Other

Fig.1.16
such sites were Shortughai, in far-off Afghanistan,

near the best source of lapis lazuli, a blue stone
that was apparently very highly valued, and Lothal
which was near sources of carnelian (from Bharuch
in Gujarat), steatite (from south Rajasthan and north
Gujarat) and metal (from Rajasthan).

Another strategy for procuring raw materials may
have been to send expeditions to areas such as the
Khetri region of Rajasthan (for copper) and south
India (for gold). These expeditions established
communication with local communities. Occasional
finds of Harappan artefacts such as steatite micro
beads in these areas are indications of such contact.
There is evidence in the Khetri area for what
archaeologists call the Ganeshwar-Jodhpura culture,
with its distinctive non-Harappan pottery and
an unusual wealth of copper objects. It is possible
that the inhabitants of this region supplied copper
to the Harappans.

Seals and sealings were used to facilitate long-

clay on which one or more seals were pressed,
leaving an impression. If the bag reached with

lower denominations of weights were binary (1, 2, 4,
8, 16, 32), while the higher denominations followed
the decimal system (160, 200, 320, 640). The
smaller weights were probably used for weighing
jewellery and beads. Metal scale-pans have also
been found.

8. Ancient Authority
There are indications of complex decisions being
taken and implemented in Harappan society. Take
for instance, the extraordinary uniformity of
Harappan artefacts as evident in pottery (Fig. 1.14),
seals, weights and bricks. Notably, bricks, though
obviously not produced in any single centre, were of
a uniform ratio throughout the region, from Jammu
to Gujarat. We have also seen that settlements were
strategically set up in specific locations for various
reasons. Besides, labour was mobilised for making
bricks and for the construction of massive walls
and platforms.

Who organised these activities?

8.1 Palaces and kings

If we look for a centre of power or for depictions of
people in power, archaeological records provide no
immediate answers. A large building found at
Mohenjodaro was labelled as a palace by
archaeologists but no spectacular finds were
associated with it. A stone statue was labelled and

Fig. 1.23
A “priest-king” continues to be known as the “priest-king”. This is

because archaeologists were familiar with
Mesopotamian history and its “priest-kings” and have
found parallels in the Indus region. But as we will
see (p.23), the ritual practices of the Harappan
civilisation are not well understood yet nor are there
any means of knowing whether those who performed
them also held political power.

Some archaeologists are of the opinion that
Harappan society had no rulers, and that everybody
enjoyed equal status. Others feel there was no single
ruler but several, that Mohenjodaro had a separate
ruler, Harappa another, and so forth. Yet others
argue that there was a single state, given the

material. It is likely that the Harappans practiced
some sort of democratic system. Some of the
structures with their given features were created
apparently for utilitarian purposes.

the Harappan state, came to an end. This is

FROM JOHN MARSHALL, Mohenjodaro and the Indus Civilisation, 1931.

Sixteen skeletons of people with the ornaments that they were wearing when they died were found from the
same part of Mohenjodaro in 1925.

Much later, in 1947, R.E.M. Wheeler, then Director-General of the ASI, tried to correlate this archaeological
evidence with that of the Rigveda, the earliest known text in the subcontinent. He wrote:
The Rigveda mentions pur, meaning rampart, fort or stronghold. Indra, the Aryan war-god is called puramdara,
the fort-destroyer.

Where are – or were – these citadels? It has in the past been supposed that they were mythical … The recent
excavation of Harappa may be thought to have changed the picture. Here we have a highly evolved civilisation
of essentially non-Aryan type, now known to have employed massive fortifications … What destroyed this
firmly settled civilisation? Climatic, economic or political deterioration may have weakened it, but its ultimate
extinction is more likely to have been completed by deliberate and large-scale destruction. It may be no mere
chance that at a late period of Mohenjodaro men, women, and children, appear to have been massacred there.
On circumstantial evidence, Indra stands accused.
FROM R.E.M. WHEELER, “Harappa 1946”, Ancient India, 1947.

In the 1960s, the evidence of a massacre in Mohenjodaro was questioned by an archaeologist named George
Dales. He demonstrated that the skeletons found at the site did not belong to the same period:
Whereas a couple of them definitely seem to indicate a slaughter, … the bulk of the bones were found in
contexts suggesting burials of the sloppiest and most irreverent nature. There is no destruction level covering
the latest period of the city, no sign of extensive burning, no bodies of warriors clad in armour and surrounded
by the weapons of war. The citadel, the only fortified part of the city, yielded no evidence of a final defence.
FROM G.F. DALES, “The Mythical Massacre at Mohenjodaro”, Expediton, 1964.

As you can see, a careful re-examination of the data can sometimes lead to a reversal of earlier interpretations.
In this respect, it is necessary to mention the recent archaeogenetic research carried out at the site of
Rakhigarhi. The site, located in Hisar district of Haryana, is the biggest Harappan city, spread over an area of
550 Hectare. In order to study the genetic history of the Harappans, DNA was extracted from the skeletal
remains excavated at Rakhigarhi. This research was carried out by The
Deccan College Deemed University, Pune in collaboration with Centre
for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad and The Harvard Medical
College. The analysis of the data indicates that the Harappans are the
indigenous people of this region.

The genetic roots of the Harappans go back to 10,000 BCE. The DNA
of the Harappans has continued till today and a majority of the South
Asian population appears to be their descendents. Due to trade and
cultural contacts of the Harappans with distant regions there is a mixture
of genes in small quantity. The continuity without any break in genetic
history as well as cultural history rules out large scale immigration of the

Harappan skeletal remains from
so-called Aryans. This research also indicates that the people coming

society. At no stage, the genetic history of the Indians was either
discontinued or broken. As the Harappans started moving towards Iran
and Central Asia, their genes also gradually spread in these regions.

The same team of researchers reconstructed 3D features of the
Harappan people. The reconstructed facial features of the Harappans,
male and female, show remarkable similarity with the modern population
of Haryana. Thus, this study has indicated unbroken continuity for
5000 years in this region.

did not know what to make of the strange artefacts
that occasionally surfaced, washed by floods or
exposed by soil erosion, or turned up while ploughing
a field, or digging for treasure.

10.1 Cunningham’s confusion
When Cunningham, the first Director-General of the
ASI, began archaeological excavations in the mid-
nineteenth century, archaeologists preferred to use
the written word (texts and inscriptions) as a guide
to investigations. In fact, Cunningham’s main
interest was in the archaeology of the Early Historic
(c. sixth century BCE-fourth century CE) and later
periods. He used the accounts left by Chinese
Buddhist pilgrims who had visited the subcontinent
between the fourth and seventh centuries CE to locate
early settlements. Cunningham also collected,
documented and translated inscriptions found
during his surveys. When he excavated sites he
tended to recover artefacts that he thought had
cultural value.

A site like Harappa, which was not part of the
itinerary of the Chinese pilgrims and was not known

as an Early Historic city, did not fit very neatly within Cunningham’s sketch of the first-
his framework of investigation. So, although known seal from Harappa
Harappan artefacts were found fairly often during
the nineteenth century and some of these reached
Cunningham, he did not realise how old these were.

A Harappan seal was given to Cunningham by an
Englishman. He noted the object, but unsuccessfully
tried to place it within the time-frame with which
he was familiar. This was because he, like many
others, thought that Indian history began with the
first cities in the Ganga valley (see Chapter 2). Given
his specific focus, it is not surprising that he missed
the significance of Harappa.

11. Problems of Piecing Together
the Past

As we have seen, it is not the Harappan script that
helps in understanding the ancient civilisation. Rather,
it is material evidence that allows archaeologists to
better reconstruct Harappan life. This material could
be pottery, tools, ornaments, household objects, etc.
Organic materials such as cloth, leather, wood and
reeds generally decompose, especially in tropical
regions. What survive are stone, burnt clay (or
terracotta), metal, etc.

It is also important to remember that only broken
or useless objects would have been thrown away.
Other things would probably have been recycled.
Consequently, valuable artefacts that are found
intact were either lost in the past or hoarded and
never retrieved. In other words, such finds are
accidental rather than typical.

11.1 Classifying finds
Recovering artefacts is just the beginning of the
archaeological enterprise. Archaeologists then
classify their finds. One simple principle of
classification is in terms of material, such as stone,
clay, metal, bone, ivory, etc. The second, and more
complicated, is in terms of function: archaeologists
have to decide whether, for instance, an artefact is
a tool or an ornament, or both, or something meant
for ritual use.

An understanding of the function of an artefact is
often shaped by its resemblance with present-day
things – beads, querns, stone blades and pots are
obvious examples. Archaeologists also try to identify
the function of an artefact by investigating the
context in which it was found: was it found in a
house, in a drain, in a grave, in a kiln?

Sometimes, archaeologists have to take recourse
to indirect evidence. For instance, though there are
traces of cotton at some Harappan sites, to find out
about clothing we have to depend on indirect
evidence including depictions in sculpture.

Archaeologists have to develop frames of reference.
We have seen that the first Harappan seal that was
found could not be understood till archaeologists had
a context in which to place it – both in terms of the
cultural sequence in which it was found, and in
terms of a comparison with finds in Mesopotamia.

BRICKS, BEADS AND BONES 23

11.2 Problems of interpretation
The problems of archaeological interpretation are
perhaps most evident in attempts to reconstruct
religious practices. Early archaeologists thought that
certain objects which seemed unusual or unfamiliar
may have had a religious significance. These included
terracotta figurines of women, heavily jewelled, some
with elaborate head-dresses. These were regarded
as mother goddesses. Rare stone statuary of men in
an almost standardised posture, seated with one
hand on the knee – such as the “priest-king” – was
also similarly classified. In other instances,
structures have been assigned ritual significance.
These include the Great Bath and fire altars found
at Kalibangan and Lothal.

 Attempts have also been made to reconstruct
religious beliefs and practices by examining seals,
some of which seem to depict ritual scenes. Others,
with plant motifs, are thought to indicate nature
worship. Some animals – such as the one-horned
animal, often called the “unicorn” – depicted on seals
seem to be mythical, composite creatures. In some
seals, a figure shown seated cross-legged in a “yogic”
posture, sometimes surrounded by animals, has
been regarded as a depiction of “proto-Shiva”, that
is, an early form of one of the major deities of
Hinduism. Besides, conical stone objects have been

Fig. 1.26
classified as lingas.

Was this a mother goddess?
Many reconstructions of Harappan religion are

made on the assumption that later traditions provide
parallels with earlier ones. This is because
archaeologists often move from the known to the
unknown, that is, from the present to the past. While
this is plausible in the case of stone querns and
pots, it becomes more speculative when we extend
it to “religious” symbols.

Let us look, for instance, at the “proto-Shiva” seals.
The earliest religious text, the Rigveda (compiled c.
1500-1000 BCE) mentions a god named Rudra, which
is a name used for Shiva in later Puranic traditions
(in the first millennium CE; see also Chapter 4). Fig. 1.27

However, unlike Shiva, Rudra in the Rigveda is A “proto-Shiva” seal

THEM Kings, Farmers and Towns
THEME TWO

TWO Early States and Economies

(c. 600 BCE-600 CE)

There were several developments in different parts of the
subcontinent during the long span of 1,500 years following
the end of the Harappan civilisation. This was also the
period during which the Rigveda was composed by people
living along the Indus and its tributaries. Agricultural

settlements emerged in many parts of the
subcontinent, including north India, the
Deccan Plateau, and parts of Karnataka.
Besides, there is evidence of pastoral
populations in the Deccan and further
south. New modes of disposal of the dead,
including the making of elaborate stone
structures known as megaliths, emerged in
central and south India from the first
millennium BCE. In many cases, the dead
were buried with a rich range of iron tools
and weapons.

(Madhya Pradesh), the most visible was the emergence of early states, empires

other changes, evident in the ways in which agricultural
production was organised. Simultaneously, new towns
appeared almost throughout the subcontinent.

Historians attempt to understand these developments
by drawing on a range of sources – inscriptions, texts,
coins and visual material. As we will see, this is a complex
process. You will also notice that these sources do not
tell the entire story.

Asoka was the first ruler who inscribed his

politically or economically significant was necessarily
recorded in inscriptions. For instance, routine
agricultural practices and the joys and sorrows of
daily existence find no mention in inscriptions, which
focus, more often than not, on grand, unique events.
Besides, the content of inscriptions almost invariably
projects the perspective of the person(s) who
commissioned them. As such, they need to be
juxtaposed with other perspectives so as to arrive at
a better understanding of the past.

Thus epigraphy alone does not provide a full
understanding of political and economic history. Also,
historians often question both old and new evidence.
Scholars in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries were primarily interested in the histories
of kings. From the mid-twentieth century onwards,
issues such as economic change, and the ways in
which different social groups emerged have assumed
far more importance. Recent decades have seen a
much greater preoccupation with histories of
marginalised groups. This will probably lead to fresh
investigations of old sources, and the development
of new strategies of analysis.

THEME TWO

THREE Early Societies

(C. 600 BCE-600 CE)

In the previous chapter we saw that there were several
changes in economic and political life between c. 600
BCE and 600 CE. Some of these changes influenced societies
as well. For instance, the extension of agriculture into
forested areas transformed the lives of forest dwellers;
craft specialists often emerged as distinct social groups;
the unequal distribution of wealth sharpened social
differences.

Historians often use textual
traditions to understand these
processes. Some texts lay down
norms of social behaviour; others
describe and occasionally comment
on a wide range of social situations
and practices. We can also catch a
glimpse of some social actors from
inscriptions. As we will see, each
text (and inscription) was written
from the perspective of specific
social categories. So we need to
keep in mind who composed what
and for whom. We also need to
consider the language used, and
the ways in which the text
circulated. Used carefully, texts allow us to piece together Fig. 3.1

two sets of warring cousins. The text also contains sections
laying down norms of behaviour for various social groups.
Occasionally (though not always), the principal characters
seem to follow these norms. What does conformity with
norms and deviations from them signify?

1. The Critical Edition of the
Mahabharata

One of the most ambitious projects of scholarship
began in 1919, under the leadership of a noted Indian
Sanskritist, V.S. Sukthankar. A team comprising
dozens of scholars initiated the task of preparing a
critical edition of the Mahabharata. What exactly did
this involve? Initially, it meant collecting Sanskrit
manuscripts of the text, written in a variety of
scripts, from different parts of the country.

The team worked out a method of comparing
verses from each manuscript. Ultimately, they
selected the verses that appeared common to most
versions and published these in several volumes,
running into over 13,000 pages. The project took 47
years to complete. Two things became apparent: there
were several common elements in the Sanskrit
versions of the story, evident in manuscripts found
all over the subcontinent, from Kashmir and Nepal
in the north to Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the south.
Also evident were enormous regional variations in
the ways in which the text had been transmitted
over the centuries. These variations were
documented in footnotes and appendices to the main
text. Taken together, more than half the 13,000 pages
are devoted to these variations.

 In a sense, these variations are reflective of the
complex processes that shaped early (and later)
social histories – through dialogues between
dominant traditions and resilient local ideas and
practices. These dialogues are characterised by
moments of conflict as well as consensus.

contained in normative Sanskrit texts were on the
whole recognised as authoritative: they were also
questioned and occasionally even rejected. It is
important to keep this in mind as we examine how
historians reconstruct social histories.

defined as relatives, or to use a more technical term,
kinfolk. While familial ties are often regarded as
“natural” and based on blood, they are defined in
many different ways. For instance, some societies
regard cousins as being blood relations, whereas
others do not.

For early societies, historians can retrieve
information about elite families fairly easily; it is,
however, far more difficult to reconstruct the familial
relationships of ordinary people. Historians also
investigate and analyse attitudes towards family and
kinship. These are important, because they provide
an insight into people’s thinking; it is likely that
some of these ideas would have shaped their actions,
just as actions may have led to changes in attitudes.

janapadas (Chapter 2, Map 1). Ultimately, the
conflict ended in a battle, in which the Pandavas
emerged victorious. After that, patrilineal succession
was proclaimed. While patriliny had existed prior to
the composition of the epic, the central story of the
Mahabharata reinforced the idea that it was valuable.
Under patriliny, sons could claim the resources
(including the throne in the case of kings) of their
fathers when the latter died.

Most ruling dynasties (c. sixth century BCE onwards)
claimed to follow this system, although there were
variations in practice: sometimes there were no sons,

The concern with patriliny was not unique to ruling
families. It is evident in mantras in ritual texts such
as the Rigveda. It is possible that these attitudes
were shared by wealthy men and those who claimed
high status, including Brahmanas.

Producing fine sons

Here is an excerpt of a mantra from the Rigveda, which was probably inserted
in the text c. 1000 BCE, to be chanted by the priest while conducting the marriage
ritual. It is used in many Hindu weddings even today:

I free her from here, but not from there. I have bound her firmly there, so
that through the grace of Indra she will have fine sons and be fortunate in
her husbands love.

Why kinfolk quarrelled

This is an excerpt from the Adi Parvan (literally, the first
section) of the Sanskrit Mahabharata, describing why
conflicts arose amongst the Kauravas and Pandavas:

The Kauravas were the  sons of Dhritarashtra, and
the Pandavas  were their cousins. Since Dhritarashtra
was blind, his younger brother Pandu ascended the

but they give us an idea about what those who wrote the
text thought. Sometimes, as in this case, they contain
conflicting ideas.

3. Social Differences:
Within and Beyond the Framework

of Caste
You are probably familiar with the term caste, which
refers to a set of hierarchically ordered social
categories. The ideal order was laid down in the
Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras. Brahmanas
claimed that this order, in which they were ranked
first, was divinely ordained, while placing groups
classified as Shudras and “untouchables” at the very
bottom of the social order. Positions within the order
were supposedly determined by birth.

3.1 The “right” occupation
The Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras also
contained rules about the ideal “occupations” of the
four categories or varnas. Brahmanas were supposed
to study and teach the Vedas, perform sacrifices and
get sacrifices performed, and give and receive gifts.
Kshatriyas were to engage in warfare, protect people
and administer justice, study the Vedas, get
sacrifices performed, and make gifts. The last three Source 6

Proper social roles

Here is a story from the Adi Parvan of the Mahabharata:

Once Drona, a Brahmana who taught archery to the
Kuru princes, was approached by Ekalavya, a forest-
dwelling nishada (a hunting community). When Drona,
who knew the dharma, refused to have him as his pupil,
Ekalavya returned to the forest, prepared an image of
Drona out of clay, and treating it as his teacher, began
to practise on his own. In due course, he acquired
great skill in archery. One day, the Kuru princes went
hunting and their dog, wandering in the woods, came
upon Ekalavya. When the dog smelt the dark nishada
wrapped in black deer skin, his body caked with dirt,
it began to bark. Annoyed, Ekalavya shot seven arrows
into its mouth. When the dog returned to the Pandavas,
they were amazed at this superb display of archery.
They tracked down Ekalavya, who introduced himself
as a pupil of Drona.

Ü What message do you think Drona had once told his favourite student Arjuna,

3.2 Non-Kshatriya kings
According to the Shastras, only Kshatriyas could be
kings. However, several important ruling lineages
probably had different origins. The social background
of the Mauryas, who ruled over a large empire, has
been hotly debated. While later Buddhist texts
suggested they were Kshatriyas, Brahmanical texts
described them as being of “low” origin. The Shungas
and Kanvas, the immediate successors of the
Mauryas, were Brahmanas. In fact, political power
was effectively open to anyone who could muster
support and resources, and rarely depended on birth
as a Kshatriya.

Other rulers, such as the Shakas who came
from Central Asia, were regarded as mlechchhas,

Reprint 2025-26



KINSHIP, CASTE AND CLASS 63

barbarians or outsiders by the Brahmanas. However,
one of the earliest inscriptions in Sanskrit describes
how Rudradaman, the best-known Shaka ruler
(c. second century CE), rebuilt Sudarshana lake
(Chapter 2). This suggests that powerful mlechchhas
were familiar with Sanskritic traditions.

It is also interesting that the best-known ruler of
the Satavahana dynasty, Gotami-puta Siri-Satakani,
claimed to be both a unique Brahmana (eka
bamhana) and a destroyer of the pride of Kshatriyas.
He also claimed to have ensured that there was no
intermarriage amongst members of the four varnas.
At the same time, he entered into a marriage alliance
with the kin of Rudradaman.

As you can see from this example, integration
within the framework of caste was often a
complicated process. The Satavahanas claimed to
be Brahmanas, whereas according to the
Brahmanas, kings ought to have been Kshatriyas.
They claimed to uphold the fourfold varna order, but
entered into marriage alliances with people who were
supposed to be excluded from the system. And, as
we have seen, they practised endogamy instead of
the exogamous system recommended in the
Brahmanical texts.

3.3 Jatis and social mobility
These complexities are reflected in another term used
in texts to refer to social categories – jati. In
Brahmanical theory, jati, like varna, was based on
birth. However, while the number of varnas was fixed
at four, there was no restriction on the number of
jatis. In fact, whenever Brahmanical authorities
encountered new groups – for instance, people living
in forests such as the nishadas – or wanted to assign
a name to occupational categories such as the
goldsmith or suvarnakara, which did not easily fit Fig. 3.5
into the fourfold varna system, they classified them Silver coin depicting a Shaka ruler,
as a jati.  Jatis which shared a common occupation c. fourth century CE

or profession were sometimes organised into shrenis
or guilds.

We seldom come across documents that record
the histories of these groups. But there are
exceptions.  One interesting stone inscription (c. fifth
century CE), found in Mandasor (Madhya Pradesh),
records the history of a guild of silk weavers who

A tiger-like husband

This is a summary of a story from the Adi Parvan of the
Mahabharata:

The Pandavas had fled into the forest. They were tired
and fell asleep; only Bhima, the second Pandava,
renowned for his prowess, was keeping watch. A
man-eating rakshasa caught the scent of the Pandavas
and sent his sister Hidimba to capture them. She fell in
love with Bhima, transformed herself into a lovely
maiden and proposed to him. He refused. Meanwhile,
the rakshasa arrived and challenged Bhima to a
wrestling match. Bhima accepted the challenge and
killed him. The others woke up hearing the noise.
Hidimba introduced herself, and declared her love for
Bhima. She told Kunti: I have forsaken my friends,
my dharma and my kin; and good lady, chosen your
tiger-like son for my man  whether you think me a
fool, or your devoted servant, let me join you, great
lady, with your son as my husband.

Ultimately, Yudhisthira agreed to the marriage on
condition that they would spend the day together but
that Bhima would return every night. The couple
roamed all over the world during the day. In due course

categories as “untouchable”. This rested on a notion

extension “pure”. Those who considered themselves
pure avoided taking food from those they designated
as “untouchable”. In sharp contrast to the purity
aspect, some activities were regarded as
particularly “polluting”. These included handling
corpses and dead animals. Those who performed
such tasks, designated as chandalas, were placed
at the very bottom of the hierarchy. Their touch
and, in some cases, even seeing them was regarded
as “polluting” by those who claimed to be at the top
of the social order.

The Manusmriti laid down the “duties” of the

A Story of Bodhisattva from the Matanga Jataka

Did chandalas resist the attempts to push them to the
bottom of the social order? Read this story, which is part
of the Matanga Jataka, a Pali text, where the Bodhisattva
(the Buddha in a previous birth) is identified as a chandala.

Once, the Bodhisattva was born outside the city of
Banaras as a chandala’s son and named Matanga. One
day, when he had gone to the city on some work, he
encountered Dittha Mangalika, the daughter of a
merchant. When she saw him, she exclaimed “I have
seen something inauspicious” and washed her eyes.
The angry hangers-on then beat him up. In protest, he
went and lay down at the door of her father’s house.
On the seventh day they brought out the girl and gave
her to him. She carried the starving Matanga back to
the chandala settlement. Once he returned home, he
decided to renounce the world. After attaining spiritual
powers, he returned to Banaras and married her. A
son named Mandavya Kumara was born to them. He
learnt the three Vedas as he grew up and began to
provide food to 16,000 Brahmanas every day.

One day, Matanga, dressed in rags, with a clay alms
bowl in his hand, arrived at his son’s doorstep and
begged for food. Mandavya replied that he looked like
an outcaste and was unworthy of alms; the food was
meant for the Brahmanas. Matanga said: “Those who
are proud of their birth and are ignorant do not deserve
gifts. On the contrary, those who are free from vices
are worthy of offerings.” Mandavya lost his temper and
asked his servants to throw the man out. Matanga rose
in the air and disappeared. When Dittha Mangalika
learnt about the incident, she followed Matanga and
begged his forgiveness. He asked her to take a bit of
the leftover from his bowl and give it to Mandavya
and the Brahmanas …

How could men and women
acquire wealth?

For men, the Manusmriti declares, there are seven means
of acquiring wealth: inheritance, finding, purchase,
conquest, investment, work, and acceptance of gifts from
good people.

For women, there are six means of acquiring wealth:

from her brother, mother or father. She could also acquire Ü Compare and contrast the

4.2 Varna and access to property
According to the Brahmanical texts, another
criterion (apart from gender) for regulating access
to wealth was varna. As we saw earlier, the only
“occupation” prescribed for Shudras was servitude,
while a variety of occupations were listed for men of
the first three varnas. If these provisions were
actually implemented, the wealthiest men would
have been the Brahmanas and the Kshatriyas. That
this corresponded to some extent with social realities
is evident from descriptions of priests and kings in
other textual traditions. Kings are almost invariably
depicted as wealthy; priests are also generally shown
to be rich, though there are occasional depictions of
the poor Brahmana.

At another level, even as the Brahmanical view of
society was codified in the Dharmasutras and
Dharmashastras, other traditions developed
critiques of the varna order. Some of the best-known
of these were developed within early Buddhism
(c. sixth century BCE onwards; see also Chapter 4).
The Buddhists recognised that there were differences
in society, but did not regard these as natural or
inflexible. They also rejected the idea of claims to
status on the basis of birth.

Buddhist attitudes towards varna.

Avantiputta asked Kachchana what he thought about
Brahmanas who held that they were the best caste
and that all other castes were low; that Brahmanas
were a fair caste while all other castes were dark; that
only Brahmanas were pure, not non-Brahmanas; that
Brahmanas were sons of Brahma, born of his mouth,

4.3 An alternative social scenario:
Sharing wealth

So far we have been examining situations where
people either claimed or were assigned status on
the basis of their wealth. However, there were other
possibilities as well; situations where men who were
generous were respected, while those who were
miserly or simply accumulated wealth for themselves
were despised. One area where these values were
cherished was ancient Tamilakam, where, as we saw
earlier (Chapter 2), there were several chiefdoms
around 2,000 years ago. Amongst other things, the
chiefs were patrons of bards and poets who sang
their praise. Poems included in the Tamil Sangam
anthologies often illuminate social and economic

5. Explaining Social Differences:
A Social Contract

The Buddhists also developed an alternative
understanding of social inequalities, and of the
institutions required to regulate social conflict. In a
myth found in a text known as the Sutta Pitaka they
suggested that originally human beings did not have
fully evolved bodily forms, nor was the world of plants
fully developed. All beings lived in an idyllic state of
peace, taking from nature only what they needed for
each meal.

However, there was a gradual deterioration of
this state as human beings became increasingly
greedy, vindictive and deceitful. This led them to
wonder: “What if we were to select a certain being
who should be wrathful when indignation is right,
who should censure that which should rightly be
censured and should banish him who deserves to
be banished? We will give him in return a proportion
of the rice …  chosen by the whole people, he will be
known as mahasammata, the great elect.”

This suggests that the institution of kingship
was based on human choice, with taxes as a form
of payment for services rendered by the king. At
the same time, it reveals recognition of human
agency in creating and institutionalising economic
and social relations. There are other implications
as well. For instance, if human beings were
responsible for the creation of the system, they could
also change it in future.

6. Handling Texts
Historians and the Mahabharata

If you look through the sources cited in this chapter
once more you will notice that historians consider
several elements when they analyse texts. They
examine whether texts were written in Prakrit, Pali
or Tamil, languages that were probably used by
ordinary people, or in Sanskrit, a language meant
almost exclusively for priests and elites. They also
consider the kinds of text. Were these mantras, learnt
and chanted by ritual specialists, or stories that
people could have read, or heard, and then retold if
they found them interesting? Besides, they try to
find out about the author(s) whose perspectives and
ideas shaped the text, as well as the intended

audience, as, very often, authors keep the interests
of their audience in mind while composing their
work. And they try and ascertain the possible date
of the composition or compilation of the texts as well
as the place where they may have been composed. It
is only after making these assessments that they
draw on the content of texts to arrive at an
understanding of their historical significance. As you
can imagine, this is a particularly difficult task for
a text as complex as the Mahabharata.

6.1 Language and content
Let us look at the language of the text. The version
of the Mahabharata we have been considering is in
Sanskrit (although there are versions in other
languages as well). However, the Sanskrit used in
the Mahabharata is far simpler than that of the Vedas,
or of the prashastis discussed in Chapter 2. As such,
it was probably widely understood.

Historians usually classify the contents of the
present text under two broad heads – sections that

norms, designated as didactic. This division is by no
means watertight – the didactic sections include
stories, and the narrative often contains a social
message. However, generally historians agree that
the Mahabharata was meant to be a dramatic, moving
story, and that the didactic portions were probably
added later.

 Interestingly, the text is described as an itihasa
within early Sanskrit tradition. The literal meaning
of the term is “thus it was”, which is why it is
generally translated as “history”. Was there a real
war that was remembered in the epic? We are not
sure. Some historians think that the memory of an
actual conflict amongst kinfolk was preserved in the
narrative; others point out that there is no other
corroborative evidence of the battle.

6.2 Author(s) and dates
Who wrote the text? This is a question to which
there are several answers. The original story was
probably composed by charioteer-bards known as
sutas who generally accompanied Kshatriya warriors

Panchalas, around whom the story of the epic
revolves, were gradually becoming kingdoms. Did the
new kings want their itihasa to be recorded and
preserved more systematically? It is also possible
that the upheavals that often accompanied the
establishment of these states, where old social values
were often replaced by new norms, are reflected in
some parts of the story.

We notice another phase in the composition of
the text between c. 200 BCE and 200 CE. This was the
period when the worship of Vishnu was growing in
importance, and Krishna, one of the important
figures of the epic, was coming to be identified with
Vishnu. Subsequently, between c. 200 and 400 CE,
large didactic sections resembling the Manusmriti
were added. With these additions, a text which
initially perhaps had less than 10,000 verses grew
to comprise about 100,000 verses. This enormous
composition is traditionally attributed to a sage
named Vyasa.

6.3 The search for convergence
The Mahabharata, like any major epic, contains vivid
descriptions of battles, forests, palaces and
settlements. In 1951-52, the archaeologist B.B. Lal
excavated at a village named Hastinapura in Meerut
(Uttar Pradesh). Was this the Hastinapura of the
epic? While the similarity in names could be
coincidental, the location of the site in the Upper
Ganga doab, where the Kuru kingdom was situated,
suggests that it may have been the capital of the
Kurus mentioned in the text.

Lal found evidence of five occupational levels, of
which the second and third are of interest to us.
This is what Lal noted about the houses in the second
phase (c. twelfth-seventh centuries BCE): “Within the
limited area excavated, no definite plans of houses
were obtained, but walls of mud and mud-bricks
were duly encountered. The discovery of mud-plaster
with prominent reed-marks suggested that some of
the houses had reed walls plastered over with mud.”
For the third phase (c. sixth-third centuries BCE), he
noted: “Houses of this period were built of mud-brick
as well as burnt bricks. Soakage jars and brick
drains were used for draining out refuse water, while
terracotta ring-wells may have been used both as
wells and drainage pits.”

Present-day historians suggest that the fact that
the author(s) describe a polyandrous union indicates
that polyandry may have been prevalent amongst
ruling elites at some point of time. At the same time,
the fact that so many different explanations are
offered for the episode (Source 16) suggests that
polyandry gradually fell into disfavour amongst the
Brahmanas, who reworked and developed the text
through the centuries.

Some historians note that while the practice of
polyandry may have seemed unusual or even
undesirable from the Brahmanical point of view, it
was (and is) prevalent in the Himalayan region.
Others suggest that there may have been a shortage
of women during times of warfare, and this led to
polyandry. In other words, it was attributed to a
situation of crisis.

Some early sources suggest that polyandry was
not the only or even the most prevalent form of
marriage. Why then did the author(s) choose to
associate this practice with the central characters
of the Mahabharata? We need to remember that
creative literature often has its own narrative
requirements and does not always literally reflect
social realities.

The growth of the Mahabharata did not stop with
the Sanskrit version. Over the centuries, versions
of the epic were written in a variety of languages

peoples, communities, and those who wrote the

Most retellings or re-enactments of the epic draw on
the main narrative in creative ways. Let us look at one
example, an episode from the Mahabharata that has
been transformed by Mahashweta Devi, a contemporary
Bengali writer known for raising her voice against all
forms of exploitation and oppression. In this particular
instance, she works out alternative possibilities from
the main story of the Mahabharata and draws attention
to questions on which the Sanskrit text is silent.

 The Sanskrit text describes how Duryodhana plotted
to kill the Pandavas by inviting them to stay in a
specially prepared house of lac, which he planned to
set on fire. Forewarned, the Pandavas dug a tunnel to
ensure their escape. Then Kunti arranged for a feast.
While most of the invitees were Brahmanas, a nishada
woman came with her five sons. When they were
satiated with drink and fell off to sleep, the Pandavas
escaped, setting fire to the house. When the bodies of
the woman and her sons were discovered, people
thought that the Pandavas were dead.

In her short story titled “Kunti O Nishadi”,
Mahashweta Devi takes up the narrative from where
the Mahabharata ends it. She sets the story in a forest,
where Kunti retires after the war. Kunti now has time
to reflect on her past, and often confesses to what she
regards as her failings, talking with the earth, the
symbol of nature. Every day she sees the nishadas who
come to collect wood, honey, tubers and roots. One
nishadi (a nishada woman) often listens to Kunti when
she talks with the earth.

One day, there was something in the air; the animals
were fleeing the forest. Kunti noticed that the nishadi
was watching her, and was startled when she spoke to
her and asked if she remembered the house of lac. Yes,
Kunti said, she did. Did she remember a certain elderly
nishadi and her five young sons? And that she had
served them wine till they were senseless, while she
escaped with her own sons? That nishadi … “Not you!”
Kunti exclaimed. The nishadi replied that the woman
who was killed had been her mother-in-law. She added
that while Kunti had been reflecting on her past, not
once did she remember the six innocent lives that were
lost because she had wanted to save herself and her
sons. As they spoke, the flames drew nearer. The nishadi
escaped to safety, but Kunti remained where she was.

(c. 600 BCE - 600 CE)

In this chapter we shall go on a long journey across a
thousand years to read about philosophers and their
attempts to understand the world they inhabited. We will
also see how their ideas were compiled as oral and written
texts as well as expressed in architecture and sculpture.
These are indicative of the enduring influence these
thinkers had on people. While we will be focusing on
Buddhism, it is important to remember that this tradition
did not develop in isolation – there were several other
traditions, each engaged in debates and dialogues with
the others.

The sources that historians use to reconstruct this
exciting world of ideas and beliefs include Buddhist, Jaina

Nineteenth-century Europeans were very interested
in the stupa at Sanchi.  In fact, the French sought
Shahjehan Begum’s permission to take away the
eastern gateway, which was the best preserved, to
be displayed in a museum in France. For a while
some Englishmen also wanted to do the same, but
fortunately both the French and the English were
satisfied with carefully prepared plaster-cast copies
and the original remained at the site, part of the
Bhopal state.

The rulers of Bhopal, Shahjehan Begum and her
successor Sultan Jehan Begum, provided money for
the preservation of the ancient site. No wonder then

and rebirth.  Was rebirth due to past actions?  Such
issues were hotly debated. Thinkers were concerned
with understanding and expressing the nature of
the ultimate reality. And others, outside the Vedic
tradition, asked whether or not there even was a
single ultimate reality. People also began speculating
on the significance of the sacrificial tradition.

2.3 Debates and discussions
We get a glimpse of lively discussions and debates
from Buddhist texts, which mention as many as 64
sects or schools of thought. Teachers travelled from
place to place, trying to convince one another as
well as laypersons, about the validity of their
philosophy or the way they understood the world.
Debates took place in the kutagarashala – literally,
a hut with a pointed roof – or in groves where
travelling mendicants halted. If a philosopher
succeeded in convincing one of his rivals, the
followers of the latter also became his disciples. So
support for any particular sect could grow and shrink
over time.

Many of these teachers, including Mahavira and
the Buddha, questioned the authority of the Vedas.
They also emphasised individual agency – suggesting
that men and women could strive to attain liberation
from the trials and tribulations of worldly existence.
This was in marked contrast to the Brahmanical
position, wherein, as we have seen, an individual’s
existence was thought to be determined by his or
her birth in a specific caste or gender.

Verses from the Upanishads

Here are two verses from the Chhandogya Upanishad, a text composed
in Sanskrit c. sixth century BCE:

The nature of the self
This self of mine within the heart, is smaller than paddy or barley or
mustard or millet or the kernel of a seed of millet. This self of mine
within the heart is greater than the earth, greater than the intermediate
space, greater than heaven, greater than these worlds.

86  THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY

How Buddhist texts were
prepared and preserved

The Buddha (and other teachers) taught orally  through discussion and
debate. Men and women (perhaps children as well) attended these discourses
and discussed what they heard. None of the Buddhas speeches were written
down during his lifetime. After his death (c. fifth-fourth century BCE) his
teachings were compiled by his disciples at a council of elders or senior
monks at Vesali (Pali for Vaishali in present-day Bihar). These compilations
were known as Tipitaka  literally, three baskets to hold different types of
texts. They were first transmitted orally and then written and classified
according to length as well as subject matter.

The Vinaya Pitaka included rules and regulations for those who joined the
sangha or monastic order; the Buddhas teachings were included in the Sutta
Pitaka;  and the Abhidhamma Pitaka dealt with philosophical matters.  Each
pitaka comprised a number of individual texts. Later, commentaries were
written on these texts by Buddhist scholars.

As Buddhism travelled to new regions such as Sri Lanka, other texts such
as the Dipavamsa (literally, the chronicle of the island) and Mahavamsa (the
great chronicle) were written, containing regional histories of Buddhism.
Many of these works contained biographies of the Buddha. Some of the
oldest texts are in Pali, while later compositions are in Sanskrit.

When Buddhism spread to East Asia, pilgrims such as Fa Xian and Xuan
Zang travelled all the way from China to India in search of texts. These they
took back to their own country, where they were translated by scholars.
Indian Buddhist teachers also travelled to faraway places, carrying texts to
disseminate the teachings of the Buddha.

Buddhist texts were preserved in manuscripts for several centuries in
monasteries in different parts of Asia. Modern translations have been prepared
from Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan texts.

Fatalists and materialists?

Here is an excerpt from the Sutta Pitaka, describing a
conversation between king Ajatasattu, the ruler of
Magadha, and the Buddha:

On one occasion King Ajatasattu   visited the Buddha
and described what another teacher, named  Makkhali
Gosala,  had told him:

Though the wise should hope, by this virtue  by
this penance I will gain karma  and the fool should
by the same means hope to gradually rid himself of his
karma, neither of them can do it. Pleasure and pain,
measured out as it were, cannot be altered in the
course of samsara (transmigration). It can neither be
lessened or increased  just as a ball of string will when
thrown unwind to its full length, so fool and wise alike
will take their course and make an end of sorrow.

And this is what a philosopher named Ajita
Kesakambalin taught:

There is no such thing, O king, as alms or sacrifice,
or offerings  there is no such thing as this world or
the next 

A human being is made up of the four elements.
When he dies the earthy in him returns to the earth,
the fluid to water, the heat to fire, the windy to air,
and his senses pass into space 

The talk of gifts is a doctrine of fools, an empty lie 
fools and wise alike are cut off and perish. They do
not survive after death.

The first teacher belonged to the tradition of the Ajivikas.
They have often been described as fatalists: those who
believe that everything is predetermined. The second
teacher belonged to the tradition of the Lokayatas, usually
described as materialists.  Texts from these traditions have
not survived, so we know about them only from the works
of other traditions.

3.Beyond Worldly Pleasures
The Message of Mahavira

The basic philosophy of the Jainas was already in
existence in north India before the birth of
Vardhamana, who came to be known as Mahavira,
in the sixth century BCE. According to Jaina tradition,
Mahavira was preceded by 23 other teachers or
tirthankaras – literally, those who guide men and
women across the river of existence.

The most important idea in Jainism is that the
entire world is animated:  even stones, rocks and
water have life. Non-injury to living beings, especially
to humans, animals, plants and insects, is central
to Jaina philosophy.  In fact the principle of ahimsa,
emphasised within Jainism, has left its mark on
Indian thinking as a whole. According to Jaina
teachings, the cycle of birth and rebirth is shaped
through karma.  Asceticism and penance are required
to free oneself from the cycle of karma. This can be
achieved only by renouncing the world; therefore,

celibacy; and to abstain from possessing property.
Source 4

The world beyond the palace

Just as the Buddhas teachings were compiled by his followers, the teachings of
Mahavira were also recorded by his disciples. These were often in the form of stories,
which could appeal to ordinary people. Here is one example, from a Prakrit text
known as the Uttaradhyayana Sutta, describing how a queen named Kamalavati
tried to persuade her husband to renounce the world:

If the whole world and all its treasures were yours, you would not be satisfied,
nor would all this be able to save you. When you die, O king and leave all things
behind, dhamma alone, and nothing else, will save you. As a bird dislikes the
cage, so do I dislike (the world). I shall live as a nun without offspring, without
desire, without the love of gain, and without hatred 

Those who have enjoyed pleasures and renounced them, move about like the
wind, and go wherever they please, unchecked like birds in their flight 

Leave your large kingdom  abandon what pleases the senses, be without
attachment and property, then practise severe penance, being firm of energy

5. The Teachings of the Buddha
The Buddha’s teachings have been reconstructed
from stories, found mainly in the Sutta Pitaka.
Although some stories describe his miraculous
powers, others suggest that the Buddha tried to
convince people through reason and persuasion
rather than through displays of supernatural power.
For instance, when a grief-stricken woman whose
child had died came to the Buddha, he gently
convinced her about the inevitability of death rather
than bring her son back to life. These stories were
narrated in the language spoken by ordinary people
so that these could be easily understood.

According to Buddhist philosophy, the world is
transient (anicca) and constantly changing; it is
also soulless (anatta )  as there is nothing
permanent or eternal in it. Within this transient
world, sorrow (dukkha) is intrinsic to human
existence. It is by following the path of moderation
between severe penance and self-indulgence
that human beings can rise above these worldly
troubles. In the earliest forms of Buddhism,
whether or not god existed was irrelevant.

Source 5

Buddhism in practice

This is an excerpt from the Sutta Pitaka, and contains the
advice given by the Buddha to a wealthy householder
named Sigala:

In five ways should a master look after his servants
and employees  by assigning them work according
to their strength, by supplying them with food and
wages, by tending them in sickness; by sharing
delicacies with them and by granting leave at times 

In five ways should the clansmen look after the needs
of samanas (those who have renounced the world)
and Brahmanas: by affection in act and speech and
mind, by keeping open house to them and supplying
their worldly needs.

behave with his parents, teacher and wife.

cycle of rebirth and attain self-realisation and
nibbana, literally the extinguishing of the ego and
desire – and thus end the cycle of suffering for those
who renounced the world. According to Buddhist
tradition, his last words to his followers were: “Be
lamps unto yourselves as all of you must work out
your own liberation.”

6. Followers of the Buddha
Soon there grew a body of disciples of the Buddha
and he founded a sangha, an organisation of monks
who too became teachers of dhamma. These monks
lived simply, possessing only the essential requisites
for survival, such as a bowl to receive food once a
day from the laity. As they lived on alms, they were
known as bhikkhus.

Initially, only men were allowed into the sangha,
but later women also came to be admitted. According
to Buddhist texts, this was made possible through
the mediation of Ananda, one of the Buddha’s dearest
disciples, who persuaded him to allow women
into the sangha. The Buddha’s foster mother,
Mahapajapati Gotami was the first woman to be
ordained as a bhikkhuni. Many women who entered
the sangha became teachers of dhamma and went
on to become theris, or respected women who had
attained liberation.

The Buddha’s followers came from many social
groups. They included kings, wealthy men and
gahapatis, and also humbler folk: workers, slaves
and craftspeople. Once within the sangha, all were
regarded as equal, having shed their earlier social
identities on becoming bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. The
internal functioning of the sangha was based on the
traditions of ganas and sanghas, where consensus
was arrived at through discussions. If that failed,
decisions were taken by a vote on the subject.

Rules for monks and nuns

These are some of the rules laid down in the Vinaya
Pitaka:

When a new felt (blanket/rug) has been made by a
bhikkhu, it is to be kept for (at least) six years. If after
less than six years he should have another new felt
(blanket/rug) made, regardless of whether or not he
has disposed of the first, then  unless he has been
authorised by the bhikkhus  it is to be forfeited and
confessed.

In case a bhikkhu arriving at a family residence is
presented with cakes or cooked grain-meal, he may
accept two or three bowlfuls if he so desires. If he
should accept more than that, it is to be confessed.
Having accepted the two or three bowlfuls and having
taken them from there, he is to share them among the
bhikkhus. This is the proper course here.

Should any bhikkhu, having set out bedding in a
lodging belonging to the sangha  or having had it set
out  and then on departing neither put it away nor
have it put away, or should he go without taking leave,
it is to be confessed.

Ü Can you explain why these rules were framed?

Buddhism grew rapidly both during the lifetime
of the Buddha and after his death, as it appealed to
many people dissatisfied with existing religious
practices and confused by the rapid social changes
taking place around them. The importance attached
to conduct and values rather than claims of
superiority based on birth, the emphasis placed on
metta (fellow feeling) and karuna (compassion),
especially for those who were younger and weaker
than oneself, were ideas that drew men and women
to Buddhist teachings.

he attained enlightenment (Bodh Gaya), where he

8. Discovering Stupas
The Fate of Amaravati and Sanchi

Each stupa has a history of its own – as we have
just seen, some of these are histories of how they
were built. But there are histories of discoveries as
well, and let us now turn to some of these. In 1796,
a local raja who wanted to build a temple stumbled
upon the ruins of the stupa at Amaravati. He
decided to use the stone, and thought there might
be some treasure buried in what seemed to be a
hill.  Some years later, a British official named Colin
Mackenzie (see also Chapter 7) visited the site.
Although he found several pieces of sculpture and

Fig. 4.11 made detailed drawings of them, these reports were
The eastern gateway, Sanchi never published.
Notice the vibrant sculpture. In 1854, Walter Elliot, the commissioner

of Guntur (Andhra Pradesh), visited
Amaravati and collected several
sculpture panels and took them away
to Madras. (These came to be called the
Elliot marbles after him.) He also
discovered the remains of the western
gateway and came to the conclusion that
the structure at Amaravati was one of
the largest and most magnificent
Buddhist stupas ever built. By the
1850s, some of the slabs from Amaravati
had begun to be taken to different
places: to the Asiatic Society of Bengal
at Calcutta, to the India Office in
Madras and some even to London. It was
not unusual to find these sculptures
adorning the gardens of British
administrators. In fact, any new official
in the area continued to remove
sculptures from the site on the grounds
that earlier officials had done the same.

One of the few men who had a different
point of view was an archaeologist
named H.H. Cole. He wrote: “It seems
to me a suicidal and indefensible policy
to allow the country to be looted of
original works of ancient art.” He
believed that museums should have
plaster-cast facsimiles of sculpture,
whereas the originals should remain

Why did Sanchi survive while Amaravati did not? Sanchi survived.
Perhaps Amaravati was discovered before scholars
understood the value of the finds and realised how
critical it was to preserve things where they had
been found instead of removing them from the site. In situ means on the spot.
When Sanchi was “discovered” in 1818, three of its
four gateways were still standing, the fourth was
lying on the spot where it had fallen and the mound
was in good condition. Even so, it was suggested
that the gateway be taken to either Paris or London;

9. Sculpture
We have just seen how sculptures were
removed from stupas and transported
all the way to Europe. This happened
partly because those who saw them
considered them to be beautiful and
valuable, and wanted to keep them for
themselves. Let us look at some of these
more closely.

9.1 Stories in stone
You may have seen wandering storytellers
carrying scrolls (charanachitras) of cloth
or paper with pictures on them and
pointing to the pictures as they tell
the story.

Look at Figure 4.13. At first sight
the sculpture seems to depict a rural
scene, with thatched huts and trees.
However, art historians who have
carefully studied the sculpture at
Sanchi identify it as a scene from
the Vessantara Jataka. This is a
story about a generous prince who
gave away everything to a
Brahmana, and went to live in
the forest with his wife and
children. As you can see in this

9.3 Popular traditions
Other sculptures at Sanchi were

perhaps not directly inspired by
Buddhist ideas. These include

beautiful women swinging from the
edge of the gateway, holding onto a

tree (Fig.4.17). Initially, scholars were
a bit intrigued about this image,

which seemed to have little to do with
renunciation. However, after examining other
literary traditions, they realised that it could be a
representation of what is described in Sanskrit as
a shalabhanjika. According to popular belief, this
was a woman whose touch caused trees to flower
and  bear fruit.  It is likely that this was regarded
as an auspicious symbol and integrated into the
decoration of the stupa. The shalabhanjika motif
suggests that many people who turned to Buddhism Fig. 4.18

An elephant at Sanchi
enriched it with their own pre-Buddhist and even
non-Buddhist beliefs, practices and ideas.
Some of the recurrent motifs in the
sculpture at Sanchi were evidently
derived from these traditions.

There are other images as well. For
instance, some of the finest depictions
of animals are found there. These
animals include elephants, horses,
monkeys and cattle. While the Jatakas
contain several animal stories that are
depicted at Sanchi, it is likely that many
of these animals were carved to create
lively scenes to draw viewers. Also,
animals were often used as symbols of
human attributes. Elephants, for example,
were depicted to signify strength and wisdom.

Paintings from the past
While stone sculpture survives the ravages of time and is
therefore most easily available to the historian, other visual
means of communication, including paintings, were also
used in the past. Those that have survived best are on
walls of caves, of which those from Ajanta (Maharashtra)
are the most famous.

The paintings at Ajanta depict stories from the Jatakas.
These include depictions of courtly life, processions, men
and women at work, and festivals. The artists used the
technique of shading to give a three-dimensional quality.
Some of the paintings are extremely naturalistic.

identify her with a popular goddess, Gajalakshmi –

earliest modern art historians, James Fergusson,
considered Sanchi to be a centre of tree and
serpent worship. He was not familiar with Buddhist
literature – most of which had not yet been
translated – and arrived at this conclusion by
studying only the images on their own.

10. New Religious Traditions
Fig. 4.22

10.1 The development of Mahayana An image of the Buddha from

Buddhism Mathura, c. first century CE

By the first century CE, there is evidence of
changes in Buddhist ideas and practices. Early
Buddhist teachings had given great importance
to self-effort in achieving nibbana. Besides, the
Buddha was regarded as a human being who
attained enlightenment and nibbana through
his own efforts. However, gradually the idea of
a saviour emerged. It was believed that he
was the one who could ensure salvation.
Simultaneously, the concept of the Bodhisatta
also developed. Bodhisattas were perceived as
deeply compassionate beings who accumulated
merit through their efforts but used this not to
attain nibbana and thereby abandon the world,
but to help others. The worship of images of the
Buddha and Bodhisattas became an important
part of this tradition.

This new way of thinking was called Mahayana
– literally, the “great vehicle”. Those who adopted
these beliefs described the older tradition as
Hinayana or the “lesser vehicle”.

Hinayana or Theravada?
Supporters of Mahayana regarded other Buddhists
as followers of Hinayana. However, followers of the
older tradition described themselves as theravadins,
that is, those who followed the path of old, respected
teachers, the theras.

10.2 The growth of Puranic Hinduism
The notion of a saviour was not unique to Buddhism.
We find similar ideas being developed in different
ways within traditions that we now consider part of
Hinduism. These included Vaishnavism (a form of

Ü What does the proportion devotee and the god was visualised as one of love
of the figures suggest? and devotion, or bhakti.

In the case of Vaishnavism,
cults developed around the
various avatars or incarnations
of the deity. Ten avatars were
recognised within the tradition.
These were forms that the deity
was believed to have assumed in
order to save the world whenever
it was threatened by disorder and
destruction because of the
dominance of evil forces. It is
likely that different avatars were
popular in different parts of the
country. Recognising each of
these local deities as a form of
Vishnu was one way of creating
a more unified religious tradition.

Some of these forms were
represented in sculptures, as were
other deities. Shiva, for instance,
was symbolised by the linga,
although he was occasionally
represented in human form too.
All such representations depicted
a complex set of ideas about the
deities and their attributes
through symbols such as head-
dresses, ornaments and ayudhas
– weapons or auspicious objects
the deities hold in their hands –
how they are seated, etc.

including women and Shudras, who did not have
access to Vedic learning.

Much of what is contained in the Puranas evolved
through interaction amongst people – priests,
merchants, and ordinary men and women who
travelled from place to place sharing ideas and
beliefs. We know for instance that Vasudeva-Krishna
was an important deity in the Mathura region. Over
centuries, his worship spread to other parts of the
country as well.

10.3 Building temples
Around the time that the stupas at sites such as
Sanchi were acquiring their present form, the first
temples to house images of gods and goddesses were
also being built. The early temple was a small square
room, called the garbhagriha, with a single doorway
for the worshipper to enter and offer worship to the
image. Gradually, a tall structure, known as the

of these were constructed in the third century BCE

on the orders of Asoka for renouncers who belonged
to the Ajivika sect.

This tradition evolved through various stages and
culminated much later – in the eighth century – in
the carving out of an entire temple, that of
Kailashnatha (a name of Shiva).

of the chief sculptor after he completed the temple
at Ellora: “Oh how did I make it!”

11. Can We See Everything?
By now you have had a glimpse of the rich visual
traditions that existed in the past – expressed in
brick and stone architecture, sculpture and
painting. We have seen that much has been
destroyed and lost over the centuries. Nevertheless,
what remains and has been preserved conveys a
sense of the vision of the artists, sculptors, masons
and architects who created these spectacular works.
Yet, do we always automatically understand what
they wanted to convey? Can we ever know what these
images meant to people who saw them and venerated
them about 2,000 years ago?

11.1  Grappling with the unfamiliar
It will be useful to recall that when nineteenth-
century European scholars first saw some of the
sculptures of gods and goddesses, they could not
understand what these were about. Sometimes, they
were horrified by what seemed to them grotesque

108  THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY

figures, with multiple arms and heads or with
combinations of human and animal forms.

These early scholars tried to make sense of what
appeared to be strange images by comparing

them with sculpture with which they were
familiar, that from ancient Greece. While they
often found early Indian sculpture inferior
to the works of Greek artists, they were very
excited when they discovered images of the
Buddha and Bodhisattas that were evidently
based on Greek models. These were, more
often than not, found in the northwest, in
cities such as Taxila and Peshawar, where
Indo-Greek rulers had established
kingdoms in the second century BCE. As
these images were closest to the Greek
statues these scholars were familiar
with, they were considered to be the
best examples of early Indian art. In
effect, these scholars adopted a strategy
we all frequently use – devising
yardsticks derived from the familiar to
make sense of the unfamiliar.

11.2 If text and image do not match …
Consider another problem. We have seen
that art historians often draw upon textual
traditions to understand the meaning of
sculptures. While this is certainly a far
more efficacious strategy than comparing
Indian images with Greek statues, it is not
always easy to use. One of the most
intriguing examples of this is a famous
sculpture along a huge rock surface in
Mahabalipuram (Tamil Nadu).

Clearly, Fig. 4.30 is a vivid depiction of
a story. But which story is it? Art historians
have searched through the Puranas to

identify it and are sharply divided in their
opinions. Some feel that this depicts the

descent of the river Ganga from heaven – the

natural cleft through the centre of the rock surface
might represent the river. The story itself is narrated
in the Puranas and the epics. Others feel that it
represents a story from the Mahabharata – Arjuna
doing penance on the river bank in order to acquire
arms – pointing to the central figure of an ascetic.

Finally, remember that many rituals, religious beliefs
and practices were not recorded in a permanent,
visible form – as monuments, or sculpture, or even
paintings. These included daily practices, as well as
those associated with special occasions. Many
