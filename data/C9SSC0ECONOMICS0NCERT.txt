The Story of Village Palampur
Chapter
Overview
The purpose of the story is to introduce
some basic concepts relating to production
and this we do through a story of a
hypothetical village called Palampur.*
Farming is the main activity in
Palampur, whereas several other
activities such as small scale
manufacturing, dairy, transport, etc. are
carried out on a limited scale. These
production activities need various types
of resources — natural resources, manmade items, human effort, money, etc. As
we read through the story of Palampur,
we will learn how various resources
combine to produce the desired goods and
services in the village.

Introduction
Palampur is well-connected with
neighbouring villages and towns. Raiganj,
a big village, is 3 kms from Palampur. An
all weather road connects the village to
Raiganj and further on to the nearest
small town of Shahpur. Many kinds of
transport are visible on this road starting
from bullock carts, tongas, bogeys (wooden
cart drawn by buffalos) loaded with jaggery
(gur) and other commodities to motor
vehicles like motorcycles, jeeps, tractors
and trucks.
This village has about 450 families
belonging to several different castes. The
80 upper caste families own the majority
of land in the village. Their houses, some
of them quite large, are made of brick with
cement plastering. The SCs (dalits)
comprise one third of the population and
live in one corner of the village and in
much smaller houses some of which are
of mud and straw. Most of the houses have

electric connections. Electricity powers all
the tubewells in the fields and is used in
various types of small business. Palampur
has two primary schools and one high
school. There is a primary health centre
run by the government and one private
dispensary where the sick are treated.
• The description above shows that
Palampur has fairly well-developed
system of roads, transport, electricity,
irrigation, schools and health centre.
Compare these facilities with those in
your nearby village.
The story of Palampur, an imaginary
village, will take us through the different
types of production activities in the
village. In villages across India, farming
is the main production activity. The other
production activities, referred to as nonfarm
activities
include
small
manufacturing, transport, shop-keeping,
etc. We shall take a look at both these
types of activities, after learning a few
general things about production.

* The narrative is partly based on a research study by Gilbert Etienne of a village in Bulandshahr district in Western
Uttar Pradesh.

Organisation of Production
The aim of production is to produce the
goods and services that we want. There
are four requirements for production of
goods and services.
The first requirement is land, and
other natural resources such as water,
forests, minerals.
The second requirement is labour, i.e.
people who will do the work. Some
production activities require highly
educated workers to perform the
necessary tasks. Other activities require
workers who can do manual work. Each
worker is providing the labour necessary
for production.
The third requirement is physical
capital, i.e. the variety of inputs required
at every stage during production. What
are the items that come under physical
capital?
(a) Tools, machines, buildings: Tools and
machines range from very simple tools
such as a farmer’s plough to
sophisticated machines such as
generators, turbines, computers, etc.
Tools, machines, buildings can be used
in production over many years, and
are called fixed capital.
(b) Raw materials and money in hand:
Production requires a variety of raw
materials such as the yarn used by
the weaver and the clay used by the
potter. A lso, some money is always
required during production to make
payments and buy other necessary
items. Raw materials and money in
hand are called working capital.
Unlike tools, machines and buildings,
these are used up in production.
There is a fourth requirement too. You
will need knowledge and enterprise to be
able to put together land, labour and
physical capital and produce an output
either to use yourself or to sell in the
market. This these days is called human
2
capital. We shall learn more about human
capital in the next chapter.
• In the picture, identify the land, labour
and fixed capital used in production.

Picture 1.2
A factory, with several labourers
and machines
Every production is organised by
combining land, labour, physical capital
and human capital, which are known as
factors of production. As we read
through the story of Palampur, we will
learn more about the first three factors
of production. For convenience, we will
refer to the physical capital as the capital
in this chapter.

Farming in Palampur
1. Land is fixed
Farming is the main production activity
in Palampur. 75 per cent of the people
who are working are dependent on
farming for their livelihood. They could
be farmers or farm labourers. The wellbeing of these people is closely related to
production on the farms.
But remember that there is a basic
constraint in raising farm production.
Land area under cultivation is practically
fixed. Since 1960 in Palampur, there has
been no expansion in land area under

cultivation. By then, some of the
wastelands in the village had been
converted to cultivable land. There exists
no further scope to increase farm
production by bringing new land under
cultivation.

larger areas of land more effectively. The
first few tubewells were installed by the
government. So on, however, farmers
started setting up private tubewells. As a
result, by mid-1970s the entire cultivated
area of 200 hectares (ha.) was irrigated.

The standard unit of measuring land
is hectare, though in the villages you
may find land area being discussed
in local units such as bigha, guintha
etc. One hectare equals the area of a
square with one side measuring 100
metres. Can you compare the area of
a 1 hectare field with the area of your
school ground?

Not all villages in India have such
high levels of irrigation. Apart from
the riverine plains, coastal regions in
our country are well-irrigated. In
contrast, plateau regions such as the
Deccan plateau have low levels of
irrigation. Of the total cultivated area
in the country a little less than 40
per cent is irrigated even today. In
the remaining areas, farming is
largely dependent on rainfall.

2. Is there a way one can grow more
from the same land?
In the kind of crops grown and facilities
available, Palampur would resemble a
village of the western part of the state of
Uttar Pradesh. All land is cultivated in
Palampur. No land is left idle. During the
rainy season (kharif) farmers grow jowar
and bajra. These plants are used as cattle
feed. It is followed by cultivation of potato
between October and December. In the
winter season (rabi), fields are sown with
wheat. From the wheat produced, farmers
keep enough wheat for the family’s
consumption and sell the surplus wheat
at the market at Raiganj. A part of the
land area is also devoted to sugarcane
which is harvested once every year.
Sugarcane, in its raw form, or as jaggery,
is sold to traders in Shahpur.
The main reason why farmers are able
to grow three different crops in a year in
Palampur is due to the well-developed
system of irrigation. Electricity came early
to Palampur. Its major impact was to
transform the system of irrigation.
Persian wheels were, till then, used by
farmers to draw water from the wells and
irrigate small fields. People saw that the
electric-run tubewells could irrigate much
To grow more than one crop on a piece of
land during the year is known as multiple
cropping. It is the most common way of
increasing production on a given piece of
land. All farmers in Palampur grow
atleast two main crops; many are growing
potato as the third crop in the past fifteen
to twenty years.

for higher yield. Yield is measured as
crop produced on a given piece of land
during a single season. Till the mid1960s, the seeds used in cultivation
were traditional ones with relatively low
yields. T raditional seeds needed less
irrigation. Farmers used cow-dung and
other natural manure as fertilizers. All
these were readily available with the
farmers who did not have to buy them.
The Green Revolution in the late 1960s
introduced the Indian farmer to
cultivation of wheat and rice using high
yielding varieties (HYVs) of seeds.
Compared to the traditional seeds, the
HYV seeds promised to produce much
greater amounts of grain on a single plant.
As a result, the same piece of land would
now produce far larger quantities of
foodgrains than was possible earlier. HYV
seeds, however, needed plenty of water
and also chemical fertilizers and
pesticides to produce best results.

Higher yields were possible only from a
combination of HYV seeds, irrigation,
chemical fertilisers, pesticides, etc.
Farmers of Punjab, Haryana and
Western Uttar Pradesh were the first to
try out the modern farming method in
India. The farmers in these regions set
up tubewells for irrigation, and made use
of HYV seeds, chemical fertilisers and
pesticides in farming. Some of them
bought farm machinery, like tractors and
threshers, which made ploughing and
harvesting faster. They were rewarded
with high yields of wheat.
In Palampur, the yield of wheat grown
from the traditional varieties was 1300 kg
per hectare. With HYV seeds, the yield
went up to 3200 kg per hectare. There
was a large increase in the production of
wheat. Farmers now had greater amounts
of surplus wheat to sell in the markets.

Modern farming methods require the
farmer to start with more cash than
before. Why?

Suggested Activity
•
During your field visit talk to some
farmers of your region. Find out:
1. What kind of farming methods —
modern or traditional or mixed — do
the farmers use? Write a note.
2. What are the sources of irrigation?
3. How much of the cultivated land is
irrigated? (very little/nearly half/
majority/all)
4. From where do farmers obtain the
inputs that they require?

3. Will the land sustain?
Land being a natural resource, it is
necessary to be careful in its use.
Scientific reports indicate that the modern
farming methods have overused the
natural resource base.
In many areas, Green Revolution is
associated with the loss of soil fertility
due to increased use of chemical
fertilisers. Also, continuous use of
groundwater for tubewell irrigation has
led to the depletion of the water-table.
Environmental resources, like soil fertility
and groundwater, are built up over years.
Once destroyed it is very difficult to
restore them. We must take care of the
environment
to
ensure
future
development of agriculture.

4. How is land distributed between
the farmers of Palampur?
You must have realised how important
land is for farming. Unfortunately, not all
the people engaged in agriculture have
sufficient land for cultivation. In Palampur,
about one third of the 450 families are
landless, i.e. 150 families, most of them
dalits, have no land for cultivation.
Of the remaining families who own
6
land, 240 families cultivate small plots
of land less than 2 hectares in size.
Cultivation of such plots doesn’t bring
adequate income to the farmer family.
In 1960, Gobind was a farmer with
2.25 hectares of largely unirrigated
land. With the help of his three sons
Gobind cultivated the land. Though
they didn’t live very comfortably, the
family managed to feed itself with a
little bit of extra income from one
buffalo that the family possessed.
Some years after Gobind’s death, this
land was divided among his three
sons. Each one now has a plot of land
that is only 0.75 hectare in size. Even
with improved irrigation and modern
farming method, Gobind’s sons are
not able to make a living from their
land. They have to look for additional
work during part of the year.
You can see the large number of small
plots scattered around the village in the
picture. These are cultivated by the small
farmers. On the other hand, more than
half the area of the village is covered by
plots that are quite large in size. In
Palampur, there are 60 families of medium
and large farmers who cultivate more
than 2 hectares of land. A few of the large
farmers have land extending over 10
hectares or more.

5. Who will provide the labour?
After land, labour is the next necessary
factor for production. Farming requires a
great deal of hard work. Small farmers
along with their families cultivate their
own fields. Thus, they provide the labour
required for farming themselves. Medium
and large farmers hire farm labourers to
work on their fields.

also. Wages vary widely from region to

activity to another (like sowing and
harvesting). There is also a wide variation
in the duration of employment. A farm

basis, or for one particular farm activity

Dala is a landless farm labourer who
works on daily wages in Palampur. This
means he must regularly look for work. The
minimum wages for a farm labourer set by
the government is Rs 300 per day (March
2019), but Dala gets only Rs 160. There is

farm labourers in Palampur, so people
agree to work for lower wages. Dala
complains about his situation to Ramkali,
who is another farm labourer.

poorest people in the village.

Why are farm labourers like Dala and
Ramkali poor?
Gosaipur and Majauli are two villages
in North Bihar. Out of a total of 850
households in the two villages, there
are more than 250 men who are
employed in rural Punjab and Haryana
or in Delhi, Mumbai, Surat, Hyderabad
or Nagpur. Such migration is common
in most villages across India. Why do
people migrate? Can you describe
(based on your imagination) the work
that the migrants of Gosaipur and
Majauli might do at the place of
destination?

6. The capital needed in farming
You have already seen that the modern
farming methods require a great deal of
capital, so that the farmer now needs
more money than before.
1. Most small farmers have to borrow
money to arrange for the capital. They
borrow from large farmers or the
village moneylenders or the traders
who supply various inputs for
cultivation. The rate of interest on
such loans is very high. They are put
to great distress to repay the loan.
Savita is a small farmer. She plans
to cultivate wheat on her 1 hectare of
land. Besides seeds, fertilizers and
pesticides, she needs cash to buy
water and repair her farm
instruments. She estimates that the
working capital itself would cost a
minimum of Rs 3,000. She doesn’t
have the money, so she decides to
borrow from Tejpal Singh, a large
farmer. Tejpal Singh agrees to give
Savita the loan at an interest rate of
24 per cent for four months, which is
a very high interest rate. Savita also
has to promise to work on his field as
a farm labourer during the harvest
season at Rs 100 per day. As you can
tell, this wage is quite low. Savita
knows that she will have to work very
hard to complete harvesting on her
own field, and then work as a farm
labourer for Tejpal Singh. The harvest
time is a very busy time. As a mother
of three children she has a lot of
household responsibilities. Savita
agrees to these tough conditions as
she knows getting a loan is difficult
for a small farmer.
2. In contrast to the small farmers, the
medium and large farmers have their
own savings from farming. They are
thus able to arrange for the capital
needed. How do these farmers have
their own savings? You shall find the
answer in the next section.

Let's discuss the story so far....
We have read about the three factors of
production—land, labour and capital—
and how they are used in farming. Let us
fill in the blanks given below.
Among the three factors of production,
we found that labour is the most
abundant factor of production. There are
many people who are willing to work as
farm labourers in the villages, whereas
the opportunities of work are limited. They
belong to either landless families or
. They are paid low wages,
and lead a difficult life.
In contrast to labour,

even the existing land is distributed

increase in production of crops.

great deal of

farmers usually need to borrow money to
arrange for the capital, and are put to
great distress to repay the loan. Therefore,
capital too is a scarce factor of production,
particularly for the small farmers.
Though both land and capital are

the two factors of production.
is a natural resource,
whereas
is man-made. It
is possible to increase capital, whereas
land is fixed. Therefore, it is very
important that we take good care of land
and other natural resources used in
farming.

7. Sale of Surplus Farm Products
Let us suppose that the farmers have
produced wheat on their lands using the
three factors of production. The wheat
is harvested and production is complete.
What do the farmers do with the wheat?
They retain a part of the wheat for the
family’s consumption and sell the
surplus wheat. Small farmers like
Savita and Gobind’s sons have little
surplus wheat because their total
production is small and from this a
substantial share is kept for their own
family needs. So it is the medium and
large farmers who supply wheat to the
market. In the Picture 1.1, you can see the
bullock cart streaming into the market
each carrying loads of wheat. The traders
at the market buy the wheat and sell it
further to shopkeepers in the towns and
cities.
10
Tejpal Singh, the large farmer, has a
surplus of 350 quintals of wheat from all
his lands! He sells the surplus wheat at
the Raiganj market and has good earnings.
What does Tejpal Singh do with his
earnings? Last year, Tejpal Singh had put
most of the money in his bank account.
Later he used the savings for lending to
farmers like Savita who were in need of a
loan. He also used the savings to arrange
for the working capital for farming in the
next season. This year Tejpal Singh plans
to use his earnings to buy another tractor.
Another tractor would increase his fixed
capital.
Like Tejpal Singh, other large and
medium farmers sell the surplus farm
products. A part of the earnings is saved
and kept for buying capital for the next
season. Thus, they are able to arrange
for the capital for farming from their own
savings. Some farmers might also use the
savings to buy cattle, trucks, or to set up
shops. As we shall see, these constitute
the capital for non-farm activities.

Non-Farm Activities in Palampur
We have learnt about farming as the main
production activity in Palampur. We shall
now take a look at some of the non-farm
production activities. Only 25 per cent
of the people working in Palampur are
engaged in activities other than
agriculture.

1. Dairy — the other common
activity
Dairy is a common activity in many families
of Palampur. People feed their buffalos on
various kinds of grass and the jowar and
bajra that grows during the rainy season.
The milk is sold in Raiganj, the nearby large
village. Two traders from Shahpur town
have set up collection cum chilling centres
at Raiganj from where the milk is
transported to far away towns and cities.

carried out mostly at home or in the fields
with the help of family labour. Rarely are
labourers hired.

High school students have started
attending them in good numbers.

People involved in trade (exchange of
goods) are not many in Palampur. The
traders of Palampur are shopkeepers who
buy various goods from wholesale
markets in the cities and sell them in
the village. You will see small general
stores in the village selling a wide range
of items like rice, wheat, sugar, tea, oil,
biscuits, soap, toothpaste, batteries,
candles, notebooks, pen, pencil, even
some cloth. A few of the families whose
houses are close to the bus stand have
used a part of the space to open small
shops. They sell eatables.

Rickshawallahs, tongawallahs, jeep,
tractor, truck drivers and people driving
the traditional bullock cart and bogey are
people in the transport services. They
ferry people and goods from one place to
another, and in return get paid for it. The
number of people involved in transport

Kishora is a farm labourer. Like other
such labourers, Kishora found it
difficult to meet his family’s needs from
the wages that he received. A few years
back Kishora took a loan from the
bank. This was under a government
programme which was giving cheap
loans to poor landless households.
Kishora bought a buffalo with this
money. He now sells the buffalo’s milk.

Further, he has attached a wooden cart
to his buffalo and uses it to transport
various items. Once a week, he goes to
the river Ganga to bring back clay for
the potter. Or sometimes he goes to
Shahpur with a load of jaggery or other
commodities. Every month he gets some
work in transport. As a result, Kishora
is able to earn more than what he used
to do some years back.

Summary
Farming is the main production activity in the village. Over the years there have
been many important changes in the way farming is practiced. These have allowed
the farmers to produce more crops from the same amount of land. This is an
important achievement, since land is fixed and scarce. But in raising production
a great deal of pressure has been put on land and other natural resources.
The new ways of farming need less land, but much more of capital. The medium
and large farmers are able to use their own savings from production to arrange
for capital during the next season. On the other hand, the small farmers who
constitute about 80 per cent of total farmers in India, find it difficult to obtain
capital. Because of the small size of their plots, their production is not enough.
The lack of surplus means that they are unable to obtain capital from their own
savings, and have to borrow. Besides the debt, many of the small farmers have
to do additional work as farm labourers to feed themselves and their families.
Labour being the most abundant factor of production, it would be ideal if
new ways of farming used much more labour. Unfortunately, such a thing has
not happened. The use of labour on farms is limited. The labour, looking for
opportunities is thus migrating to neighbouring villages, towns and cities. Some
labour has entered the non-farm sector in the village.
At present, the non-farm sector in the village is not very large. Out of every
100 workers in the rural areas in India, only 24 are engaged in non-farm activities.
Though there is a variety of non-farm activities in the villages (we have only
seen a few examples), the number of people employed in each is quite small.
In the future, one would like to see more non-farm production activities in the
village. Unlike farming, non-farm activities require little land. People with some
amount of capital can set up non-farm activities. How does one obtain this capital?
One can either use his own savings, but more often has to take a loan. It is
important that loan be available at low rate of interest so that even people without
savings can start some non-farm activity. Another thing which is essential for
expansion of non-farm activities is to have markets where the goods and services
produced can be sold. In Palampur, we saw the neighbouring villages, towns and
cities provide the markets for milk, jaggery, wheat, etc. As more villages get
connected to towns and cities through good roads, transport and telephone, it is
possible that the opportunities for non-farm activities in the village would increase
in the coming years.

People as Resource
Chapter
Overview
The chapter 'People as Resource' is an
effort to explain population as an asset
for the economy rather than a liability.
Population becomes human capital when
there is investment made in the form of
education, training and medical care.
In fact, human capital is the stock of
skill and productive knowledge embodied
in them.
'People as Resource' is a way of
referring to a country’s working people
in terms of their existing productive
skills and abilities. Looking at the
population from this productive aspect
emphasises its ability to contribute to
the creation of the Gross National
Product. Like other resources population
also is a resource — a 'human resource'.
This is the positive side of a large
population that is often overlooked when
we look only at the negative side,
considering only the problems of
providing the population with food,
education and access to health facilities.
When the existing 'human resource' is
further developed by becoming more
educated and healthy, we call it 'human
capital formation' that adds to the
productive power of the country just like
'physical capital formation'.
Investment in human capital
(through education, training, medical
care) yields a return just like investment
in physical capital. This can be seen
directly in the form of higher incomes
earned because of higher productivity
of the more educated or the better trained
persons, as well as the higher
productivity of healthier people.
16
India’s Green Revolution is a
dramatic example of how the input
of greater knowledge in the form of
improved production technologies can
rapidly increase the productivity of
scarce land resources. India’s IT
revolution is a striking instance of
how the importance of human capital
has come to acquire a higher position
than that of material, plant and
machinery.

population need not be a burden for the
economy. It can be turned into a
productive asset by investment in human
capital (for example, by spending
resources on education and health for all,
training of industrial and agricultural
workers in the use of modern technology,
useful scientific researches and so on).
The two following cases illustrate how
people can try to become a more productive
resource:

Looking at the photograph can you
explain how a doctor, teacher, engineer
and a tailor are an asset to the
economy?

Not only do the more educated and the
healthier people gain through higher
incomes, society also gains in other
indirect ways because the advantages of a
more educated or a healthier population
spreads to those also who themselves were
not directly educated or given health care.
In fact, human capital is in one way
superior to other resources like land and
physical capital: human resource can
make use of land and capital. Land and
capital cannot become useful on its own!
For many decades in India, a large
population has been considered a liability
rather than an asset. But a large
There were two friends Vilas and
Sakal living in the same village
Semapur. Sakal was a twelve-yearold boy. His mother Sheela looked
after domestic chores. His father Buta
Chaudhary worked in an agricultural
field. Sakal helped his mother in
domestic chores. He also looked after
his younger brother Jeetu and sister
Seetu. His uncle Shyam had passed
the matriculation examination, but,
was sitting idle in the house as he
had no job. Buta and Sheela were
eager to teach Sakal. They forced him
to join the village school which he
soon joined. He started studying and
completed his higher secondary
examination. His father persuaded
him to continue his studies. He raised
a loan for Sakal to study a vocational
course in computers. Sakal was
meritorious and interested in studies
from the beginning. With great vigour
and enthusiasm he completed his
course. After some time he got a job
in a private firm. He even designed a
new kind of software. This software
helped him increase the sale of the
firm. His boss acknowledged his
services and rewarded him with a
promotion.

Picture 2.2 Stories of Vilas and Sakal
Let’s Discuss
Story of Vilas
Vilas was an eleven-year old boy
residing in the same village as Sakal.
Vilas’s father Mahesh was a
fisherman. His father passed away
when he was only two years old. His
mother Geeta sold fish to earn money
to feed the family. She bought fish
from the landowner’s pond and sold
it in the nearby mandi. She could
earn only Rs 150 a day by selling fish.
Vilas became a patient of arthritis.
His mother could not afford to take
him to the doctor. He could not go to
school either. He was not interested
in studies. He helped his mother in
cooking and also looked after his
younger brother Mohan. After some
time his mother fell sick and there
was no one to look after her. There
was no one in the family to support
them. Vilas, too, was forced to sell
fish in the same village. He like his
mother earned only a meagre
income.

Do you notice any difference between
the two friends? What are those?
Activity
Visit a nearby village or a slum area
and write down a case study of a boy
or girl of your age facing the same
condition as Vilas or Sakal.

In the two case studies we saw Sakal
went to school and Vilas did not go. Sakal
was physically strong and healthy. There
was no need for him to visit the doctor
frequently. Vilas was a patient of
arthritis. He lacked the means to visit
the doctor. Sakal acquired a degree in
computer programming. Sakal found a
job in a private firm while Vilas
continued with the same work as his
mother. He earned a meagre income like
his mother to support a family.
In the case of Sakal, several years of
education added to the quality of labour.
This enhanced his total productivity.

individual through salary or in some other
form of his choice. In case of Vilas, there
could not be any education or health care
in the early part of his life. He spends
his life selling fish like his mother.
Henceforth, he draws the same salary of
unskilled labourer as his mother.
Investment in human resource (via
education and medical care) can give high
rates of return in future. This investment
on people is the same as investment in
land and capital.
A child, too, with investments made
on her education and health, can yield
a high return in future in the form of
higher
earnings
and
greater
contribution to the society. Educated
parents are found to invest more heavily
on the education of their child. This is
because they have realised the
importance of education for themselves.
They are also conscious of proper
nutrition and hygiene. They accordingly
look after their children’s needs for
education at school and good health. A
virtuous cycle is, thus, created in this
case. In contrast, a vicious cycle may
be created by disadvantaged parents,
who themselves uneducated and lacking
in hygiene, keep their children in a
similarly disadvantaged state.
Countries, like Japan, have invested
in human resource. They did not have any
natural resource. These countries are
developed/rich. They import the natural
resource needed in their country. How did
they become rich/developed? They have
invested on people, especially in the field
of education and health. These people
have made efficient use of other resources,
like land and capital. Efficiency and the
technology evolved by people have made
these countries rich/developed.

Economic Activities by Men and Women
Like Vilas and Sakal, people have been
engaged in various activities. We saw that
Vilas sold fish and Sakal got a job in the
firm. The various activities have been
classified into three main sectors i.e.,
primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary
sector includes agriculture, forestry,
animal husbandry, fishing, poultry
farming, mining and quarrying.
Manufacturing is included in the
secondary sector. Trade, transport,
communication, banking, education,
health, tourism, services, insurance, etc.
are included in the tertiary sector. The
activities in this sector result in the
production of goods and services. These
activities add value to the national
income. These activities are called
economic activities. Economic activities
have two parts — market activities and
non-market activities. Market activities
involve remuneration to anyone who
performs i.e., activity performed for pay
or profit. These include production of goods
or services, including government service.
Non-market activities are the production
for self-consumption. These can be

product and own account production of

Activity
Visit a village or colony located near
to your residential area and note
down
the
various
activities
undertaken by the people of that
village or colony.
If this is not possible, ask your
neighbour what is their profession?
In which of the three sectors will you
categorise their work?
Say whether these activities are
economic or non-economic activities:
Vilas sells fish in the village market.
Vilas cooks food for his family.
Sakal works in the private firm.
Sakal looks after his younger brother
and sister.
Due to historical and cultural reasons
there is a division of labour between men
and women in the family. Women
generally look after domestic chores and
men work in the fields. Sakal’s mother
Sheela cooks food, cleans utensils, washes
clothes, cleans the house and looks after
her children. Sakal’s father Buta
cultivates the field, sells the produce in
the market and earns money for the family.
Sheela is not paid for the services
delivered for upbringing of the family.
Buta earns money, which he spends on
rearing his family. Women are not paid
for their service delivered in the family.
The household work done by women is
not recognised in the National Income.
Geeta, mother of Vilas, earned an
income by selling fish. Thus women are
paid for their work when they enter the
labour market. Their earning like that of
their male counterpart is determined on
the basis of education and skill.
20
Education helps individual to make better
use of the economic opportunities
available before him. Education and skill
are the major determinants of the earning
of any individual in the market. A majority
of women have meagre education and low
skill formation. Women are paid low
compared to men. Most women work
where job security is not there. Various
activities relating to legal protection is
meagre. Employment in this sector is
characterised by irregular and low
income. In this sector there is an absence
of basic facilities like maternity leave,
childcare and other social security
systems. However, women with high
education and skill formation are paid at
par with the men. Among the organised
sector, teaching and medicine attract
them the most. Some women have entered
administrative and other services
including job, that need high levels of
scientific and technological competence.
Ask your sister or your classmate what
she would like to take up as a career?

Quality of Population
The quality of population depends upon
the literacy rate, health of a person
indicated by life expectancy and skill
formation acquired by the people of the
country. The quality of the poulation
ultimately decides the growth rate of the
country. Literate and healthy population
are an asset.

Education
Sakal’s education in the initial years of
his life bore him the fruits in the later
years in terms of a good job and salary.
We saw education was an important input
for the growth of Sakal. It opened new
horizon for him, provided new aspiration
and developed values of life. Not only for
Sakal, education contributes towards the
growth of society also. It enhances the

girls studying in the classroom. Study
the difference if any and explain for
reasons in the classroom.
as stated in the Budget Documents of
Union State Governments, Reserve Bank
of India, the expenditure on education as a
percentage of GDP has declined to 2.8% in
2020–21 (B.E.) The literacy rates have
increased from 18% in 1951 to 85% in 2018.
Literacy is not only a right, it is also needed
if the citizens are to perform their duties
and enjoy their rights properly. However, a
vast difference is noticed across different
sections of the population. Literacy among
males is nearly 16.1% higher than females
and it is about 14.2% higher in urban areas
as compared to rural areas. As per 2011
census, literacy rates varied from 94% in
Kerala to 62% in Bihar. The primary school
system (I–V) has expanded to over 7,78,842
lakh in 2019–20. Unfortunately, this huge
expansion of schools has been diluted by
the poor quality of schooling and high
dropout rates. Samagra Shiksha is a
significant step for the school education
sector extending from pre-school to Class
XII, with the broader goal of improving school
effectiveness measured in terms of equal
opportunities for schooling and equitable
learning outcomes. The scheme envisages
the ‘school’ as the continuum from
pre-school, primary, middle to secondary
levels and attempts to ensure inclusive and
equitable quality education from pre-school
to secondary stage in accordance with the
Sustainable Develompent Goals. Mid-day
meal scheme has been implemented to
encourage attendance and retention of
children and improve their nutritional
status. These policies could add to the
literate population of India.
The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in
higher education in the age group of 18 to
23 years is 27% in 2020–21, which
would be broadly in line with world
average. The strategy focuses on
increasing access, quality, adoption of
state-specific curriculum modification,
vocationalisation and networking on the
use of information technology. There is
also focus on distance education,
convergence of formal, non-formal,
distance and IT education institutions.

from 1951 to 2019–20.

1. Is the increase in the number of
colleges adequate to admit the
increasing number of students?
2. Do you think we should have more

4. What is your idea about future colleges
and universities?

Health
Firm maximise profit: Do you think any
firm would be induced to employ people
who might not work efficiently as healthy
workers because of ill health?
The health of a person helps him to
realise his/her potential and the ability
to fight illness. He/She will not be able
to maximise his/her output to the overall
growth of the organisation. Indeed; health
is an indispensable basis for realising one’s
well-being. Henceforth, improvement in
the health status of the population has
been the priority of the country. Our
national policy, too, aims at improving the
accessibility of healthcare, family welfare
and nutritional service with a special
focus on the underprivileged segment of
the population. Over the last five decades,
India has built a vast healt infrastructure
and has also developed the manpower
required at primary, secondary and
tertiary sector in government, as well as,
in the private sector.
These measures, which have been
adopted, have increased the life
expectancy to over 67.2 years in 2021.
*Infant mortality rate (IMR) has come
down from 147 in 1951 to 28 in 2020.
**Crude birth rates have dropped to
20.0 (2020) and ***death rates to 6
(2020) within the same duration of
time. Increase in life expectancy and
improvement in childcare are useful
in assessing the future progress of the
country. Increase in longevity of life is
an indicator of good quality of life
marked by self-confidence. Reduction
in infant mortality involves the
protection of children from infection,
ensuring the nutrition of both the
mother and the child, and childcare.

3. Do you think the increase in the
number of doctors and nurses is
adequate for India? If not, why?

How many doctors are there in the
hospital?
How many nurses work in that
hospital?
Besides, try to gather the following
additional information:
How many hospitals are there in your
locality?
How many dispensaries are there in
your locality?

4. What other facilities would you like to
provide in a hospital?
5. Discuss about the hospital you have
visited?
6. Can you draw a graph using this table.
There are many places in India which
do not have even these basic facilities.
There are only 542 medical colleges in the
country and 313 dental colleges. Just four
states, like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
Maharastra and Tamil Nadu have the
maximum number of medical colleges.

Unemployment
Sakal’s mother Sheela looked after the
domestic chores, children and helped her
husband Buta in the field. Sakal’s
brother, Jeetu, and sister, Seetu, spend
their time playing and roaming. Can you
call Sheela or Jeetu or Seetu
unemployed? If not, why?
Unemployment is said to exist when
people who are willing to work at the going
wages cannot find jobs. Sheela is not

domestic domain. Jeetu and Seetu are too
small to be counted in the work force
population. Neither Jeetu, Seetu or Sheela
can be counted as unemployed. The
workforce population includes people from
15 years to 59 years. Sakal’s brother and
sister do not fall within this age group so
they cannot be called unemployed. Sakal’s
mother Sheela works for the family. She
is not willing to work outside her domestic
domain for payment. She too cannot be
called unemployed. Sakal’s grandparents
(although not mentioned in the story)
cannot be called unemployed.
In case of India we have unemployment
in rural and urban areas. However, the
nature of unemployment differs in rural
and urban areas. In case of rural areas,
there is s e a s o n a l and d i s g u i s e d
unemployment. Urban areas have mostly
educated unemployment.
Seasonal unemployment happens
when people are not able to find jobs
during some months of the year. People
dependant upon agriculture usually face
such kind of problem. There are certain
busy seasons when sowing, harvesting,
weeding and threshing is done. Certain
months do not provide much work to the
people dependant on agriculture.
In case of disguised unemployment
people appear to be employed. They have
agricultural plot where they find work.
This usually happens among family
members engaged in agricultural activity.
The work requires the service of five
people but engages eight people. Three
people are extra. These three people also
work in the same plot as the others. The
contribution made by the three extra
people does not add to the contribution
made by the five people. If three people
are removed the productivity of the field
will not decline. The field requires the
service of five people and the three extra
people are disguised unemployed.
In case of urban areas educated
unemployment has become a common
phenomenon.
Many
youth
with
matriculation, graduation and post
graduation degrees are not able to find
job. A study showed that unemployment
of graduate and post-graduate has
increased
faster
than
among
matriculates. A paradoxical manpower
situation is witnessed as surplus of
manpower in certain categories coexist
with shortage of manpower in others.
There
is
unemployment
among
technically qualified person on one hand,
while there is a dearth of technical skills
required for economic growth.
Unemployment leads to wastage of
manpower resource. People who are an
asset for the economy turn into a liability.
There is a feeling of hopelessness and
despair among the youth. People do not
have enough money to support their
family. Inability of educated people who
are willing to work to find gainful
employment implies a great social waste.
Unemployment tends to increase
economic overload. The dependence of the
unemployed on the working population
increases. The quality of life of an
individual as well as of society is adversely
affected. When a family has to live on a
bare subsistence level there is a general
decline in its health status and rising
withdrawal from the school system.
Hence, unemployment has detrimental
impact on the overall growth of an
economy. Increase in unemployment is an
indicator of a depressed economy. It also
wastes the resource, which could have
been gainfully employed. If people cannot
be used as a resource they naturally
appear as a liability to the economy.
In case of India, statistically, the
unemployment rate is low. A large
number of people represented with low
income and productivity are counted as
employed. They appear to work
throughout the year but in terms of their
potential and income, it is not adequate
for them. The work that they are pursuing

seems forced upon them. They may
therefore want other work of their choice.
Poor people cannot afford to sit idle. They
tend to engage in any activity irrespective
of its earning potential. Their earning
keeps them on a bare subsistence level.

the secondary or the tertiary sector. In
the secondary sector, small scale
manufacturing is the most labourabsorbing. In case of the tertiary sector,
various new services are now appearing
like biotechnology, information technology
and so on.
Let us read a story to know how people
could become an asset for the economy of
a village.
Story of a Village
Picture 2.6 Can you remember how much did
you pay when you asked him to
mend your shoes or slippers?

Moreover, the employment structure
is characterised by self-employment in the
primary sector. The whole family
contributes in the field even though not
everybody is really needed. So there is
disguised unemployment in the
agriculture sector. But the entire family
shares what has been produced. This
concept of sharing of work in the field and
the produce raised reduces the hardship
of unemployment in the rural sector. But
this does not reduce the poverty of the
family, gradually surplus labour from
every household tends to migrate from the
village in search of jobs.
Let us discuss about the employment
scenario in the three sectors mentioned
earlier. Agriculture, is the most labour
absorbing sector of the economy. In recent
years, there has been a decline in the
dependence of population on agriculture
partly because of disguised unemployment
discussed earlier. Some of the surplus
labour in agriculture has moved to either
26

There was a village inhabited by
several families. Each family
produced enough to feed its members.
Each family met its needs by the
members making their own clothes
and teaching their own children. One
of the families decided to send one of
its sons to an agriculture college. The
boy got his admission in the nearby
college of agriculture. After some time
he became qualified in agroengineering and came back to the
village. He proved to be so creative
that he could design an improved
type of plough, which increased the
yield of wheat. Thus a new job of agroengineer was created and filled in the
village. The family in the village sold
the surplus in a nearby neighbouring
village. They earned good profit,
which
they
shared
among
themselves. Inspired by this success
all the families after some time held
a meeting in the village. They all
wanted to have a better future for
their children too. They requested the
panchayat to open a school in the
village. They assured the panchayat
that they would all send their
children to school. The panchayat,
with the help of government, opened
a school. A teacher was recruited
from a nearby town. All the children
of this village started going to school.
After sometime one of the families
gave training to his daughter in
tailoring. She started stitching
clothes for all the families of the
village for everyone now wanted to
buy and wear well-tailored clothes.
Thus another new job, that of a tailor
was created. This had another
positive effect. The time of the
farmers in going far for buying clothes
was saved. As the farmers spent
more time in the field, the yield of
the farms went up. This was the
beginning of prosperity. The farmers
had more than what they could
consume. Now they could sell what
they produced to others who came to
their village markets. Over time, this
village, which formally had no job
opportunities in the beginning, had
many like teacher, tailor, agro–
engineer and many more. This was
the story of a simple village where
the rising level of human capital
enabled it to evolve into a place rich
with complex and modern economic
activities.

Summary
You have seen how inputs like education and health helped in making people an
asset for the economy. The chapter also discusses about the economic activities
undertaken in the three sectors of the economy. We also study about the problem
associated with unemployment. Finally the chapter ends with the story of a village
which formally had no job but later had plenty.

Poverty as a Challenge
Chapter
Overview
This chapter deals with one of the
challenges faced by independent India—
poverty. After discussing this multidimensional problem through examples,
the chapter discusses the way poverty is
analysed by social scientists. Poverty
trends in India and the world are
illustrated through the concept of the
poverty line. Causes of poverty as well as
anti-poverty measures taken by the
government are also discussed. The
chapter ends with broadening the official
concept of poverty into human poverty.

Introduction
In our daily life, we come across many
people who we think are poor. They could
be landless labourers in villages or
people living in overcrowded jhuggis in
cities. NITI Aayog uses Multidimensional
Poverty Index to analyse the problem of
poverty faced by the country. The ratio
of multidimensional poverty has fallen from
approximately 55 per cent in 2005–06,
25 per cent in 2015–16 and to 15 per cent
in 2019–21. It is also expected that
multidimensional poverty will soon
reach single digit.

Two Typical Cases of Poverty
Urban Case
Thirty-three year old Ram Saran works
as a daily-wage labourer in a wheat flour
mill near Ranchi in Jharkhand. He
manages to earn around `3,500 a
month when he finds employment,
which is not often. The money is not
enough to sustain his family of six— his

wife and four children aged between 12
years to six months. He has to send
money home to his old parents who live
in a village near Ramgarh. His father,
a landless labourer, and his brother
who lives in Hazaribagh depend on Ram
Saran for sustenance. Ram Saran lives
in a one-room rented house in a
crowded basti in the outskirts of the
city. It is a temporary shack built of
bricks and clay tiles. His wife Santa
Devi, works as a part time maid in a
few houses and manages to earn
another `1500. They manage a meagre
meal of dal and rice twice a day, but
there is never enough for all of them.
His elder son works as a helper in a
tea shop to supplement the family’s
income and earns another `700 while
his 10-year old daughter goes to school
and takes care of the younger siblings.
They have only two pairs of hand-medown clothes each. New ones are
bought only when the old clothes
become unwearable. Shoes are a luxury.
The younger one relishes the dal-rice
served at school.

Rural case
Lakha Singh belongs to a small village
near Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. His
family does not own any land. So, they
do odd jobs for the big farmers. Work
is erratic and so is income. At times
they get paid `200 for a hard day’s
work. But often it is in kind like a few
kilograms of wheat or dal or even
vegetables for toiling in the farm
throughout the day. The family of six
are barely able to manage two square
meals a day. Lakha lives in a kuchha
hut on the outskirts of the village. The
women of the family spend the day
chopping fodder and collecting
firewood in the fields. His father, a
tuberculosis patient, passed away two
years ago due to lack of medication.
His mother now suffers from the same
disease and life is slowly ebbing away.
Although, the village has a primary
school, Lakha never went there but
he is happy to find his children going
to school. New clothes happen once
in a few years. Even soap and oil
are a luxury for the family.

Study the above cases of poverty
and discuss the following issues
related to poverty:

Helplessness
These two typical cases illustrate many
dimensions of poverty. They show that
poverty means hunger and lack of shelter.
This also speaks about a situation in which
parents are not able to give their children
nutritious food three times a day or a
situation where sick people cannot afford
treatment. Poverty also means lack of
clean water and sanitation facilities. It also
means lack of a regular job with decent
minimum wages. Above all, it means living
with a sense of helplessness. Poor people
are in a situation in which they are illtreated at almost every place, in farms,
factories, government offices, hospitals,
railway stations, etc. Obviously, nobody
would like to live in poverty.
One of the biggest challenges of
independent India has been to bring
millions of its people out of abject poverty.
Mahatama Gandhi said that India would
be truly independent only when the poorest
of its people become free of human
suffering.

Poverty as seen by social scientists
Since poverty has many facets, social
scientists look at it through a variety of
indicators. Usually the indicators are used
to relate with the levels of income and
consumption. In recent times, a variety of
other indicators have also been used to
recognise whether a person is poor or not.
For example, National Multidimensional
Poverty Index is calculated on the basis of
three broad indicators: health indicators
like nutrition, child and adolescent
mortality, maternal health. Education
indicators like years of schooling and school
attendance, and standard of living indicator
like cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water,
housing, electricity, assets, bank account.
Indicators such as social exclusion and
vulnerability are also used to understand
poverty (see box).

Social Exclusion
According to this concept, poverty
must be seen in terms of the poor
having to live only in a poor
surrounding with other poor people,
excluded from enjoying social
equality of better-off people in better
surroundings. Social exclusion can
be both a cause as well as a
consequence of poverty in the usual
sense. Broadly, it is a process through
which individuals or groups are
excluded from facilities, benefits and
opportunities that others (the
“better-offs”) enjoy. A typical
example is the working of the caste
system in India in which people
belonging to certain castes are
excluded from equal opportunities.
Social exclusion thus may lead to
or can cause more damage than
having a very low income.
Vulnerability
Vulnerability to poverty is a
measure, which describes the
greater probability of certain
communities (say, members of a
backward caste) or individuals (such
as a widow or a physically
handicapped person) of becoming or
remaining poor. Vulnerability is
determined by the options available
to different communities for finding
an alternative living in terms of
assets, education, health and job
opportunities. Further, it is analysed
on the basis of the greater risks these
groups face at the time of natural
disasters (earthquakes, tsunami).
Additional analysis is made of their
social and economic ability to handle
these risks. In fact, vulnerability
describes the greater probability of
being more adversely affected than
other people when bad time comes
for everybody, whether a flood or an
earthquake or simply a fall in the
availability of jobs!

Poverty Line
At the centre of the discussion on poverty
is the concept of the ‘poverty line’. A
common method used to measure poverty
is based on the income or consumption
levels. The term ‘consumption’ means the
amount spent on various items such as
food, clothing, etc., by a family. A person
is considered poor if his or her income or
consumption level falls below a given
‘minimum level’ necessary to fulfill the
basic needs. What is necessary to satisfy
basic needs is different at different times
and in different countries. Therefore,
poverty line may vary with time and place.
Each country uses an imaginary line that
is considered appropriate for its existing
level of development and its accepted
minimum social norms. For example, a
person not having a car in the United
States may be considered poor. In India,
owning a car is still considered a luxury.
While determining the poverty line in
India, till a few years ago, a minimum
level of food requirement, clothing,
footwear, fuel and electricity, educational
and medical needs, etc., were taken into
consideration. The physical quantities of
these needs were multiplied by their
prices in rupees. The formula for food
requirement while estimating the
poverty line was based on the desired
calorie requirement. Food items, such
as cereals, pulses, vegetables, milk, oil,
sugar, etc., together provided these
needed calories. The calorie needs vary
depending on age, sex and the type of
work that a person does. The accepted
average calorie requirement in India was
2400 calories per person per day in rural
areas and 2100 calories per person per
day in urban areas. Since people living
in rural areas engage themselves in more
physical work, calorie requirements in
rural areas were considered to be higher
than in urban areas. The bare monetary
expenditure per capita needed for
32
buying these calorie requirements in terms
of food grains, etc., and reported by
families has been considered as poverty
line. This amount was revised periodically,
taking into consideration the rise in prices.
Based on the global developments, the
Government of India has begun to
estimate the proportion of poor in India
using 12 developmental indicators, which
is popularly known as Multidimensional
Poverty Index (see box). This national
index complements the income or
consumption expenditure based poverty
measurement because it measures and
compares deprivations directly.

Let’s Discuss
Discuss the following:
•
What could be the difference between
consumption based expenditure
Poverty
Line
and
National
Multidimensional Poverty Index?

•
What do you think would be the
“minimum necessary level” in your
locality?

Poverty Estimates
Based on the methodology described in
the previous section, the number and
proportion of poor people in India, called
Head Count Ratio (HCR), is estimated.
Table 3.1 shows that during the 1990s,
the
proportion
of
‘consumption
expenditure based’ poor declined from
45 to 37 per cent. However, the number
of poor remained at about 40 crores.
During 2000–2011, both the proportion
and the number of poor declined. The
proportion of multidimensional poor
during 2015–2021 declined from 25 to
15 percent. As per the official record,
13.5 crore people have escaped
multidimensional poverty during this
period. Specifically deprivation against
various indicators have declined more
sharply in rural areas than in urban
areas.

Twelve Indicators of National Multidimensional Poverty Index
NITI Aayog, a Government of India organisation evolved the National Multidimensional
Poverty Index (NMPI) using the following 12 indicators. If an individual is found
deprived on these indicators, he or she is considered as multidimensional poor.
1. Nutrition: A household is considered deprived if any child between the ages
of 0 to 59 months, or woman between the ages of 15 to 49 years, or man
between the ages of 15 to 54 years is found to be undernourished.
2. Child-Adolescent Mortality: A household is deprived if any child or adolescent
under 18 years of age has died in the household in the five-year period
preceding the survey.
3. Maternal Health: A household is deprived if any woman in the household
who has given birth in the 5 years preceding the survey has not received
assistance from trained skilled medical personnel during the recent childbirth.
4. Years of Schooling: A household is deprived if not even one member of the
household aged 10 years or older has completed six years of schooling.
5. School attendance: A household is deprived if any school-aged child is not
attending school up to the age at which he/she would complete class.
6. Cooking Fuel: A household is deprived if a household cooks with dung,
agricultural crops, shrubs, wood, charcoal, or coal.
7. Sanitation: A household is deprived if the household has unimproved or no
sanitation facility or it is improved but shared with other households.
8. Drinking Water: A household is deprived if the household does not have access
to improved drinking water or safe drinking water is at least a 30-minute
walk from home (as a round trip).
9. Housing: A household is deprived if the household has inadequate housing: the floor
is made of natural materials, or the roof or wall are made of rudimentary materials.
10. Electricity: A household is deprived if the household has no electricity.
11. Assets: A household is deprived if the household does not own more than one
of these assets: radio, TV, telephone, computer, animal cart, bicycle, motorbike,
or refrigerator; and does not own a car or truck.
12. Bank Account: A household is deprived if no household member has a bank
account or a post office account.

Let’s Discuss
Study Table 3.1 and answer the following
questions:
• Even if poverty ratio declined between
1993–94 and 2004–05, why did the
number of poor remain at about 407
million?
• Are the dynamics of poverty reduction
the same in rural and urban India?

Study the Graph 3.1 and do the following:
• Identify the three states where the HCR
is the highest.
• Identify the three states where HCR
is the lowest.
• List the states which have HCR lower
or higher than HCR for all India.

Inter-State Disparities
Poverty in India also has another aspect
or dimension. The proportion of poor people
is not the same in every state (see graph
3.1). Although state level poverty has
witnessed a significant decline from the
levels of early seventies, the success rate of
reducing poverty varies from state to state.
It is pertinent to note that the states of
Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Punjab,
Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh,
Haryana and Maharashtra had an HCR
which was less than 10 per cent in 2019–
21. In the meantime, remarkable strides
have been made by States like Bihar, Uttar
Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.
Studies also show states following different
steps to reduce poverty. For example,
Kerala has focused more on human
34
resource development. In West Bengal,
land reform measures have helped in
reducing poverty. In Andhra Pradesh and
Tamil Nadu public distribution of food
grains have been responsible for the
improvement.

Vulnerable Groups
The proportion of people below poverty
line is also not same for all social groups
and economic categories in India. Social
groups, which are most vulnerable to
poverty are Scheduled Caste and
Scheduled Tribe households. Similarly,
among the economic groups, the most
vulnerable groups are the rural
agricultural-labour households and the
urban casual-labour households. Graph
3.2 shows the percentage of poor people
Economics
Reprint 2025-26
in all these groups. Although the average
of people below poverty line for all groups
in India is 22; however, 43 out of 100 (see
graph 3.2) people belonging to Scheduled
Tribes are not able to meet their basic
needs. Similarly, 34 per cent of casual
workers in urban areas are below poverty
line. About 34 per cent of casual farm
labour (in rural areas) and 29 per cent
of Scheduled Castes are also poor. The
double disadvantage of being a landless
casual wage labour household in the
socially disadvantaged social groups of
the scheduled caste or the scheduled
tribe
population
highlights
the
seriousness of the problem. Some recent
studies have shown that except for the
scheduled tribe households, all the other
three groups (i.e., Scheduled Castes,
rural agricultural labourers and the
urban casual labour households) have
seen a decline in poverty in the 1990s.
Apart from these social groups, there
is also inequality of incomes within a
family. In poor families all suffer, but
some suffer more than others. In some
cases, women, elderly people and female
infants are denied equal access to
resources available to the family.

Global Poverty Scenario
Is India the only country having poor
people? For making comparisons between
developing countries, many international
organisations like the World Bank use a
uniform standard for the poverty line:
minimum availability of the equivalent of
$2.15 per person per day. The proportion

extreme economic poverty— defined by the
World Bank as living on less than $2.15

in 2010 to 9.05 per cent in 2019. Why $

use rupee as a national currency, each
country has its own currency. American
dollar is used by international agencies to
compare data across countries.
Although there has been a substantial
reduction in global poverty, it is marked
with great regional differences. Poverty
declined substantially in China and
Southeast Asian countries as a result
of rapid economic growth and massive
investments in human resource
development (Read table 3.2 and graph

China has become 0.1 per cent in 2020.

Poverty and Sustainable
Development Goals
The new Sustainable Development Goals
of the United Nations (UN) propose ending
poverty of all types by 2030. It provides a
shared blueprint for peace and prosperity
for people and the planet, now and into
the future. At its centre point are the 17
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
This requires urgent action from the part
of both the developed and the developing
countries (see box).
Developed countries ought to support
the developing countries in the endeavour
of ending poverty, improve health and
education, reduce inequalities, tackling
climate change and promote sustainable
development.

The United Nations (UN) Organisation,
an international organisation works
with many countries to eradicate
poverty. In collaboration with
governments of member countries, UN
came out with 17 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) to be
achieved by 2030. They are given in
the form of infographics on the next
page. Each goal was split into various
targets to be achieved by the countries
who are members of UN. One of the
targets of SDG 1 is reducing the
proportion of men, women and children
in all ages living in poverty in all its
dimensions at least to half by 2030. The
decline in the proportion of poor reflects
India’s commitment to achieve the
target related to Goal 1: No Poverty (End
poverty in all its forms everywhere).

Causes of Poverty
There were number of causes for the
widespread poverty in India. One historical
reason is the low level of economic
development under the British colonial
administration. The policies of the colonial
government ruined traditional handicrafts
and discouraged development of industries
like textiles. The low rate of growth persisted
until the 1980s. This resulted in less job
opportunities and low growth rate of
incomes. This was accompanied by a high
growth of population.
With the spread of irrigation and the
Green Revolution, many job opportunities were
created in the agriculture sector. But the impact
was limited to some parts of India. The
industries, both in the public and the private
sector, did provide some jobs. But these were
not enough to absorb all the job seekers.
Unable to find jobs with better income in cities,
many people started working as rickshaw
pullers, vendors, construction workers,
domestic servants, etc. With irregular small
incomes, these people could not afford
reasonable shelter. They started living in slums
on the outskirts of the cities and the problems
38
of poverty, largely a rural phenomenon also
became a feature of urban India.
Another feature of high poverty rates
has been the huge income inequalities.
One of the major reasons for this is the
unequal distribution of land and other
resources. Despite many policies, we have
not been able to tackle the issue of
poverty. Major policy initiatives like land
reforms which aimed at redistribution of
assets in rural areas have not been
implemented effectively by most of the
state
governments.
Effective
implementation of policy could have
improved the life of millions of rural poor.
Many other socio-cultural and
economic factors are also responsible for
poverty. In order to fulfil social
obligations and observe religious
ceremonies, people in India, including
the very poor, spend a lot of money and
waste their hard earned income. Small
farmers need money to buy agricultural
inputs like seeds, fertilizer, pesticides,
etc. Since poor people hardly have any
savings, they borrow or accept loan at
higher risk. Unable to repay because of
poverty, they become victims of
indebtedness. So the high level of
indebtedness is both the cause and effect
of poverty.

Let’s Discuss
Observe some of the poor families
around you and try to find the following:
• Which social and economic group do
they belong to?
• Who are the earning members in the
family?
• What is the condition of the old people
in the family?
• Are all the children (both boys and girls)
attending schools?

Anti-Poverty Measures
Removal of poverty has been one of the
major objectives of Indian developmental
strategy. The current anti-poverty
strategy of the government is based
broadly on two factors — (i) promotion
of economic growth (ii) targeted antipoverty programmes.
Over a period of thirty years of
independent India, lasting up to the early
eighties, there were little per capita
income growth and not much reduction
in poverty. Official poverty estimates
which were about 45 per cent in the early
1950s remained the same even in the
early eighties. Since the eighties, India’s
economic growth has been one of the
fastest in the world. The growth rate
jumped from the average of about 3.5
per cent a year in the 1970s to about 6
per cent during the 1980s and 1990s.
The two decades of 21st century
(2000–2020) has also witnessed the rapid
economic development. The higher
growth rates have significantly helped in
the reduction of poverty. Therefore, it is
becoming clear that there is a strong link
between economic growth and poverty
reduction. Economic growth widens
opportunities and provides the resources
needed to invest in human development.
This also encourages people to send
their children, including the girl child, to
schools in the hope of getting better
economic returns by investing in
education. The poor may not be able to
take advantage from the opportunities
created by economic growth. However,
growth in the agriculture sector is much
below expectations. This has a direct
bearing on poverty. A large number of poor
people live in villages and are dependent
on agriculture.
In these circumstances, there is a clear
need
for
targeted
anti-poverty
programmes. Although there are many
schemes which are formulated to affect
poverty directly or indirectly. Some of them
are worth mentioning.
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural
Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 aims
to provide 100 days of wage employment
to every household to ensure livelihood
security in rural areas. It also aimed at
sustainable development to address the
cause of drought, deforestration and soil
erosion. One-third of the proposed jobs
have been reserved for women under this
act. The wage rate for unskilled manual
workers is revised regularly,
Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti
Abhiyan (PM Poshan) is a flagship
programme of Government of India. It
was initiated with twin purpose — (i) to
improve the nutritional requirement
especially calorie and the protein intake
of the child, (ii) improve the school
enrolment and eliminate the drop out
from the school. It targets students from
Classes I to VIII in Government,
Government aided schools and special
training centres under the Right to
Education Act.
This scheme is implemented with the
support of local governments and various
community organisations. This programme
encourages poor children, belonging to
disadvantaged sections, to attend school
more regularly and helps them concentrate
on classroom activities.
Poverty as a Challenge

Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva
Abhiyan was launched in 2016 with the aim
to reduce maternal and infant mortality by
providing quality antenatal care to the
pregnant women throughout the country.
The scheme works towards
safe
pregnancies, deliveries and addresses gaps
in the service of the maternal care, to ensure
constant and regular treatment to the
beneficiaries. Services are provided on the
ninth day of every month. This programme
follows a systematic approach for
engagement with private practitioners,
motivating them to volunteer in the scheme
at government health facilities.
Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY)
aims towards women empowerment in
rural areas. It encourages the use of
smoke-free kitchen, thereby, saving them
from chronic respiratory disorders and
poor eye sights. It was launched in 2016
with an aim to provide clean cooking fuel
(liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) to
economically poor households especially
in the rural areas, who cook using
traditional methods by using either coal,
wood or cow dungs. Its target beneficiaries
are Below Poverty Line (BPL) households,
Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes,
forest dwellers and marginalised group
households. To encourage the use of LPG,
the scheme provides a completely free
connection, including the first refill and
a stove.
Over the years there is an increase in
the LPG coverage throughout the country.
Connections are issued in the name of the
female member of the family. This scheme
also promotes environment sustainability
by reducing deforestation and carbon
emission generated from burning coal and
firewood. The use of clean cooking fuel,
i.e., LPG means less time and effort in
collecting firewood and encourages women
to participate in social and economic
activities.

The Challenges Ahead
Poverty has certainly declined in India. But
despite the progress, poverty reduction
remains India’s most compelling challenge.
Wide disparities in poverty are visible
between rural and urban areas and
among different States also. Certain social
and economic groups are more vulnerable
to poverty. Poverty reduction is expected
to make better India. This would be
possible mainly due to higher economic
growth, increasing focus on universal
education, declining population growth;
empowerment of the women and the
economically weaker sections of society
would also facilitate the same.
The income based definition of poverty
captures only a limited part of what
poverty really means to people. It is about
a ‘minimum’ subsistence level of living
rather than a ‘reasonable’ level of living.
Many scholars advocate that we must
broaden the concept into human poverty. A
large number of people may have been able
to feed themselves. But do they have
education? Or shelter? Or health care?
Or job security? Or self-confidence? Are
they free from caste and gender
discrimination? Is the practice of child
labour still common? Worldwide
experience shows that with development,
the definition of what constitutes poverty
also changes. In this chapter we have
looked at the different approaches to
measure
poverty.
The
National
Multidimensional Poverty Index put
forward by NITI Aayog reveals that the
number
and
proportion
of
multidimensionally poor has declined in
India. This may be due to the array of
Government interventions initiated in
recent years. What do you think?

Summary
In this chapter, we have looked at the different approaches of measuring poverty. The National
Multidimensional Poverty Index, put forward by NITI Aayog in collaboration with UNDP and Oxford
Policy and Human Development Initiative reveals that on the Headcount Ratio of multidimensionally
poor, there has been a considerable reduction. Even when some of the states like Kerala and Tamil
Nadu have reached less than 10 per cent on the HCR front, much is yet to be achieved by the other
states. However, it is also to be noted that due to the array of Government intervention policies
between 2005–06 and 2019–21 there has been significant decline in the number of MPI poor in the
states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

Food Security in India
Chapter
Overview
•
In the 1970s, food security was
understood as the “availability at all times
of adequate supply of basic foodstuffs”
(UN, 1975). Amartya Sen added a new
dimension to food security and
emphasised the “access” to food through
what he called ‘entitlements’ — a
combination of what one can produce,
exchange in the market alongwith state
or other socially provided supplies.
Accordingly, there has been a substantial
shift in the understanding of food security.
The 1995 World Food Summit declared,
“Food security at the individual,
household, regional, national and global
levels exists when all people, at all times,
have physical and economic access to
sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet
their dietary needs and food preferences
for an active and healthy life” (FAO, 1996,
p.3). The declaration further recognises
that “poverty eradication is essential to
improve access to food”.

Food security means availability,
accessibility and affordability of food to
all people at all times. The poor
households are more vulnerable to food
insecurity whenever there is a problem
of production or distribution of food
crops. Food security depends on the
Public Distribution System (PDS) and
government vigilance and action at
times, when this security is threatened.

What is food security?
Food is as essential for living as air is for
breathing. But food security means
something more than getting two square
meals. Food security has following
dimensions
(a) availability of food means food
production within the country, food
imports and the previous years stock
stored in government granaries.
(b) accessibility means food is within reach
of every person.
(c) affordability implies that an individual
has enough money to buy sufficient,
safe and nutritious food to meet one's
dietary needs.
Thus, food security is ensured in a
country only if (1) enough food is available
for all the persons (2) all persons have
the capacity to buy food of acceptable
quality and (3) there is no barrier on
access to food.
Why food security?
The poorest section of the society might
be food insecure most of the times while
persons above the poverty line might also
be food insecure when the country faces
42
a national disaster/calamity like
earthquake, drought, flood, tsunami,
widespread failure of crops causing
famine, etc. How is food security
affected during a calamity? Due to a
natural calamity, say drought, total
production of foodgrains decreases. It
creates a shortage of food in the affected
areas. Due to shortage of food, the prices
goes up. At the high prices, some people
cannot afford to buy food. If such calamity
happens in a very wide spread area or is
stretched over a longer time period, it
may cause a situation of starvation.
A massive starvation might take a turn
of famine.
A Famine is characterised by wide
spread deaths due to starvation and

epidemics caused by forced use of
contaminated water or decaying food and
loss of body resistance due to weakening
from starvation.
The most devastating famine that
occurred in India was the FAMINE OF
BENGAL in 1943. This famine killed thirty
lakh people in the province of Bengal.

Do you know who were affected the
most by the famine? The agricultural
labourers, fishermen, transport
workers and other casual labourers
were affected the most by dramatically
increasing price of rice. They were the
ones who died in this famine.

Nothing like Bengal famine has
happened in India again. It is, however,
disturbing to note that even today, famine
like conditions exist in many parts of the
country, leading to starvation deaths at
times. Natural calamities and pandemics
may also lead to food shortage. For
example Covid-19 pandemic had an
adverse impact upon the food security.
Restriction on movement of people and
goods and services impacted economic
activity. Therefore food security is needed
in a country to ensure food at all times,
including calamities and pandemics
Who are food-insecure?
Although a large section of people suffer
from food and nutrition insecurity in
India, the worst affected groups are
landless people with little or no land to
depend upon, traditional artisans,
providers of traditional services, petty selfemployed workers and destitutes
including beggars. In the urban areas, the
food insecure families are those whose
working members are generally employed
in ill-paid occupations and casual labour

Story of Ramu
Ramu works as a casual labourer
in agriculture in Raipur village. His
eldest son Somu who is 10 years old
also works as a pali to look after the
cattle of the Sarpanch of the village
Satpal Singh. Somu is employed for
the whole year by the Sarpanch and
is paid a sum of Rs 1,000 for this
work. Ramu has three more sons
and two daughters but they are too
young to work on the field. His wife
Sunhari is also (part time) working
as house cleaner for the livestock,
removing and managing cow dung.
She gets ½ litre milk and some
cooked food along with vegetables
for her daily work. Besides she also
works in the field along with her
husband in the busy season and
supplements
his
earnings.
Agriculture being a seasonal
activity employs Ramu only during
times of sowing, transplanting and
harvesting. He remains unemployed
for about 4 months during the
period of plant consolidation and
maturing in a year. He looks for
work in other activities. Some times
he gets employment in brick laying
or in construction activities in the
village. By all his efforts, Ramu is
able to earn enough either in cash
or kind for him to buy essentials for
two square meals for his family.
However, during the days when he
is unable to get some work, he and
his family really face difficulties and
sometimes his small kids have to
sleep without food. Milk and
vegetables are not a regular part of
meals in the family. Ramu is food
insecure during 4 months when he
remains unemployed because of the
seasonal nature of agriculture work.

Story of Ahmad
Ahmad is a rickshaw puller in
Bangalore. He has shifted from
Jhumri Taliah along with his 3
brothers, 2 sisters and old parents.
He stays in a jhuggi. The survival of
all members of his family depends on
his daily earnings from pulling
rickshaw. However, he does not have
a secured employment and his
earnings fluctuate every day. During
some days he gets enough earning for
him to save some amount after buying
all his day-to-day necessities. On
other days, he barely earns enough
to buy his daily necessities. However,
fortunately, Ahmad has a yellow card,
which is PDS Card for below poverty
line people. With this card, Ahmad
gets sufficient quantity of wheat, rice,
sugar and kerosene oil for his daily
use. He gets these essentials at half
of the market price. He purchases his
monthly stock during a particular day
when the ration shop is opened for
below poverty people. In this way,
Ahmad is able to eke out his survival
with less than sufficient earnings for
his big family where he is the only
earning member.

According to the National Health and
Family Survey (NHFS) 1998–99, the
number of such women and children is
approximately 11 crore.

run his family even with small
earnings from rickshaw-pulling?
The social composition along with the
inability to buy food also plays a role in
food insecurity. The SCs, STs and some
sections of the OBCs (lower castes among
them) who have either poor land-base or
very low land productivity are prone to
food insecurity. The people affected by
natural disasters, who have to migrate to
other areas in search of work, are also
among the most food insecure people. A
high incidence of malnutrition prevails
among women. This is a matter of serious
concern as it puts even the unborn baby
at the risk of malnutrition. A large
proportion of pregnant and nursing
mothers and children under the age of 5
years constitute an important segment of
the food insecure population.

Does Ahmad have a regular income
from rickshaw-pulling?
How does the yellow card help Ahmad
The food insecure people are
disproportionately large in some regions
of the country, such as economically
backward states with high incidence of
poverty, tribal and remote areas, regions
more prone to natural disasters etc. In
fact, the states of Uttar Pradesh (eastern
and south-eastern parts), Bihar,
J harkhand, O rissa, West B engal,
Chattisgarh, parts of Madhya Pradesh and
Maharasthra account for largest number
of food insecure people in the country.
Hunger is another aspect indicating
food insecurity. Hunger is not just an
expression of poverty, it brings about
poverty. The attainment of food security
therefore involves eliminating current
hunger and reducing the risks of future
hunger. Hunger has chronic and seasonal
dimensions. Chronic hunger is a
consequence of diets persistently
inadequate in terms of quantity and/or

hunger because of their very low income
and in turn inability to buy food even for
survival. Seasonal hunger is related to
cycles of food growing and harvesting. This
is prevalent in rural areas because of the
seasonal nature of agricultural activities
and in urban areas because of casual
labourers, e.g., there is less work for
casual construction labourers during the
rainy season. This type of hunger exists
when a person is unable to get work for
the entire year.

Food Security in India
Since the advent of the Green Revolution
in the early-1970s, the country has
avoided famine even during adverse
weather conditions.
India has become self-sufficient in
foodgrains during the last 30 years
because of a variety of crops grown all
over the country. The availability of
foodgrains (even in adverse weather
conditions or otherwise) at the country

announced price for their crops. This
price is called Minimum Support Price
(MSP). The MSP is declared by the
government every year before the sowing
season to provide incentives to farmers
for raising the production of these crops.
The purchased foodgrains are stored in
granaries. Do you know why this buffer
stock is created by the government? This
is done to distribute foodgrains in the
deficit areas and among the poorer
strata of the society at a price lower than
the market price also known as Issue
Price . This also helps resolve the
problem of shortage of food during
adverse weather conditions or during the
periods of calamity.

What is Buffer stock?
Buffer Stock is the stock of foodgrains,
namely wheat and rice, procured by the
government
through
the
Food
Corporation of India (FCI). The FCI
purchases wheat and rice from the
farmers in states where there is surplus
production. The farmers are paid a pre-
What is the Public Distribution
System?
The food procured by the FCI is distributed
through government regulated ration
shops among the poorer section of the
society. This is called the Public
Distribution System (PDS). Ration shops
are now present in most localities,

villages, towns and cities. There are
about 5.5 lakh ration shops all over the
country. Ration shops also, known as
Fair Price Shops, keep stock of
foodgrains, sugar, and kerosene for
cooking. These items are sold to people
at a price lower than the market price.
Any family with a ration card* can buy a
stipulated amount of these items (e.g. 35
kg of grains, 5 litres of kerosene, 5 kgs of
sugar etc.) every month from the nearby
ration shop.
*There are three kinds of ration cards: (a)
Antyodaya cards for the poorest of the poor;
(b) BPL cards for those below poverty line;
and (c) APL cards for all others.

Suggested Activity
Visit your area’s ration shop and get the
following details
1. When does the ration shop open?
2. What are the items sold at the ration
shop?
3. Compare the prices of rice and sugar
from the ration shop with the prices
at any other grocery shop? (for families
below poverty line)
4. Find out:
Do you have a ration card?
What has your family recently bought
with this card from the ration shop?

Are there any problems that they face?
Why are ration shops necessary?
The introduction of Rationing in India
dates back to the 1940s against the
backdrop of the Bengal famine. The
rationing system was revived in the wake
of an acute food shortage during the
1960s, prior to the Green Revolution. In
the wake of the high incidence of poverty
levels, as reported by the NSSO in the
mid-1970s, three important food
intervention
programmes
were
introduced: Public Distribution System
(PDS) for food grains (in existence earlier
but strengthened thereafter); Integrated
Child Development Services (ICDS)
(introduced in 1975 on an experimental
basis) and Food-for -Work** (FFW)
(introduced in 1977–78). Over the years,
several new programmes have been
launched and some have been
restructured with the growing experience
of administering the programmes. At
present, there are several Poverty
Alleviation Programmes (PAPs), mostly in
rural areas, which have an explicit food
component also. While some of the
programmes such as PDS, mid-day meals
etc. are exclusively food security
programmes, most of the PAPs also
enhance food security. Employment
programmes greatly contribute to food
security by increasing the income of
the poor.

**The National Food Security
Act, 2013
This Act provides for food and
nutritional security life at affordable
prices and enables people to live a life
with dignity. Under this act, 75% of
the rural population and 50% of the
urban population have been
categorised as eligible households for
food security.
Current Status of Public the
Distribution System
Public Distribution System (PDS) is the
most important step taken by the
Government of India (GoI) towards
ensuring food security. In the beginning,
the coverage of PDS was universal with
no discrimination between the poor and
the non-poor. Over the years, the policy
related to PDS has been revised to make
it more efficient and targeted. In 1992,
Revamped Public Distribution System
(RPDS) was introducted in 1,700 blocks
in the country. The target was to provide
the benefit s o f P D S t o r e m o t e a n d
backward areas. From June 1997, in a
renewed attempt, Targeted Public
Distribution System (TPDS) was
introducted to adopt the principle of
targeting the ‘poor in all areas’. It was
for the first time that a differential price
policy was adopted for poor and nonpoor. Further, in 2000, two special
schemes were launched viz., Antyodaya
Anna Yojana*** (AAY) and Annapurna
Scheme (APS) with special target groups

of ‘poorest of the poor’ and ‘indigent senior
citizens’, respectively. The functioning of
these two schemes was linked with the
existing network of the PDS.
Some important features of PDS are
summarised in Table 4.3.
The PDS has proved to be the most
effective instrument of government policy
over the years in stabilising prices and
making food available to consumers at
affordable prices. It has been
instrumental in averting widespread
hunger and famine by supplying food from
surplus regions of the country to the
deficit ones. In addition, the prices have
been under revision in favour of poor
households in general. The system,
including the minimum support price and
procurement has contributed to an
increase in foodgrain production and
provided income security to farmers in
certain regions.
However, FCI godowns are overflowing
with grains, with some rotting away and some
being eaten by rats. Graph 4.2 shows the
difference in foodgrain stocks in Central
pool and its stocking norms.
***Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY)
AAY was launched in December 2000.
Under this scheme one crore of the
poorest among the BPL families
covered under the targeted public
distribution system were identified.
Poor families were identified by the
respective state rural development
departments through a Below Poverty
Line (BPL) survey. Twenty-five
kilograms of foodgrains were made
available to each eligible family at a
highly subsidised rate of ` 2 per kg
for wheat and ` 3 per kg for rice. This
quantity has been enhanced from 25
to 35 kg with effect from April 2002.
The scheme has been further
expanded twice by additional 50 lakh
BPL families in June 2003 and in
August 2004. With this increase, 2
crore families have been covered
under the AAY.

Subsidy is a payment that a
government makes to a producer to
supplement the market price of a
commodity. Subsidies can keep
consumer prices low while maintaining
a higher income for domestic producers.

Let’s Discuss
Study the Graph 4.2 and answer the
following questions:
•
In which recent year foodgrain stock
with the government was maximum?

•
What is the minimum buffer stock
norm for the FCI?

•
Why were the FCI granaries
overflowing with foodgrains?

In 2022, the stock of wheat and rice
with Central pool is 159 LMT ( Lakh million
tonnes) of wheat and 104 LMT of rice
which was much more than the
minimum buffer norms. However, these
remained consistently higher than the
buffer norms. The situation improved
with the distribution of foodgrains under
different schemes launched by the
government. There is a general
consensus that high level of buffer
stocks of foodgrains is very undesirable
and can be wasteful. The storage of
massive food stocks has been
responsible for high carrying costs, in
addition to wastage and deterioration in
grain quality. Freezing of MSP for a few
years should be considered seriously.
The
increased

procurement at enhanced MSP # is the
result of the pressure exerted by

as Punjab, Haryana and Andhra
Pradesh. Moreover, as the procurement

increase in MSP has induced farmers,
particularly in surplus states, to divert
land from production of coarse grains,
which is the staple food of the poor, to
the production of rice and wheat. The
intensive utilisation of water in the
cultivation of rice has also led to
environmental degradation and fall in
the water level, threatening the
sustainability of the agricultural
development in these states.
#
The rising Minimum Support Prices
(MSP) have raised the maintenance
cost of procuring foodgrains by the
government. Rising transportation
and storage costs of the FCI are other
contributing factors in this increase.

As per the NSSO report No. 558 in rural
India, the per person per month
consumption of rice has declined from 6.38
Kg. in 2004-05 to 5.98 Kg in 2011-12. In
urban India, the per person per month
consumption of rice, too has declined from
4.71 Kg in 2004-05 to 4.49 Kg in 2011-12.
Per Capita consumption of PDS rice has
doubled in rural India and increased by
66% in urban India since 2004-05. The per
Capita consumption of PDS wheat has
doubled since 2004-05 in both rural and
urban India.
PDS dealers are sometimes found
resorting to malpractices like diverting
the grains to open market to get better
margin, selling poor quality grains at
ration shops, irregular opening of the
shops, etc. It is common to find that ration
shops regularly have unsold stocks of poor
quality grains left. This has proved to be
a big problem. When ration shops are
unable to sell, a massive stock of
foodgrains piles up with the FCI. In recent
years, there is another factor that has
led to the decline of the PDS. Earlier every
family, poor and non-poor had a ration
card with a fixed quota of items such as
rice, wheat, sugar etc. These were sold
at the same low price to every family. The
three types of cards and the range of
prices that you see today did not exist. A
large number of families could buy
foodgrains from the ration shops subject
to a fixed quota. These included low
income families whose incomes were
marginally higher than the below poverty
line families. Now, with TPDS of three
different prices, any family above the
poverty line gets very little discount at
the ration shop. The price for APL family
52
is almost as high as open market price,
so there is little incentive for them to buy
these items from the ration shop.

Role of cooperatives in food security
The cooperatives are also playing an
important role in food security in India
especially in the southern and western
parts of the country. The cooperative
societies set up shops to sell low priced
goods to poor people. For example, out
of all fair price shops running in Tamil
Nadu, around 94 per cent are being run
by the cooperatives. In Delhi, Mother
Dairy is making strides in provision of
milk and vegetables to the consumers
at
controlled
rate
decided
by
Government of Delhi. Amul is another
success story of cooperatives in milk
and milk products from Gujarat. It has
brought about the White Revolution in
the country. These are a few examples
of many more cooperatives running in
different parts of the country ensuring
food security of different sections
of society.
Similarly, in Maharashtra, Academy of
Development Science (ADS) has
facilitated a network of NGOs for setting
up grain banks in different regions. ADS
organises training and capacity building
programmes on food security for NGOs.
Grain Banks are now slowly taking shape
in different parts of Maharashtra. ADS
efforts to set up Grain Banks, to facilitate
replication through other NGOs and to
influence the Government’s policy on food
security are thus paying rich dividends.
The ADS Grain Bank programme is
acknowledged as a successful and
innovative food security intervention.

Summary
Food security of a nation is ensured if all of its citizens have enough nutritious food
available, all persons have the capacity to buy food of acceptable quality and there
is no barrier on access to food. The people living below the poverty line might be food
insecure all the time while better off people might also turn food insecure due to
calamity or disaster. Although a large section of people suffer from food and nutrition
insecurity in India, the worst affected groups are landless or land poor households
in rural areas and people employed in ill paid occupations and casual labourers
engaged in seasonal activities in the urban areas. The food insecure people are
disproportionately large in some regions of the country, such as economically
backward states with high incidence of poverty, tribal and remote areas, regions
more prone to natural disasters etc. To ensure availability of food to all sections of
the society the Indian government carefully designed food security system, which is
composed of two components: (a) buffer stock and (b) public distribution system. In
addition to PDS, various poverty alleviation programmes were also started which
comprised a component of food security. Some of these programmes are: Integrated
Child Development Services (ICDS); Food-for-Work (FFW); Mid-Day Meals; Antyodaya
A nna Yojana (A AY) etc. In addition to the role of the government in ensuring food
security, there are various cooperatives and NGOs also working intensively towards
this direction.
