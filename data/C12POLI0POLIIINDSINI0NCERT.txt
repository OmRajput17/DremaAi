FOREWORD

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 recommends that 
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. 
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning 
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the 
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed 
on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. 
They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance 
of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these 
measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a 
child-centred system of education outlined in the National policy on 
Education (1986).

The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals 
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own 
learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must 
recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate 
new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them 
by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of 
examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites 
of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible 
if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as 
receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of 
functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour 
in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of 
teaching days is actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for 
teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook 
proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather 
than a source of stress or boredom. syllabus designers have tried 
to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and 
reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration 
for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook 
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and 
space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion 
in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.

NCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development 
committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson 
of the Advisory Group on social science, professor Hari Vasudevan 
and the Chief Advisors for this book, shri Yogendra Yadav and 
professor suhas palshikar for guiding the  work of this committee. 
several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; 
we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are 
indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously 
permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. 
We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring

LETTER TO THE READERS 

As India completes sixty years as an independent and democratic 
country, it is time to look back and reflect on this period. so much 
of the trends and patterns of our politics as well as the strengths 
and weaknesses of our democracy have been shaped during these 
six decades. Yet it is surprising how little the younger citizens of our 
country know about this history. You would have a good idea of the 
freedom struggle because you study that in the History textbooks. 
You would also know something about our contemporary politics 
from the media. But very few young citizens know much about the 
period that connects the freedom movement to contemporary politics. 
This is the gap the present book seeks to fill. It tells you the story of 
the journey of our democracy during the last sixty years so that you 
can make sense of the political reality that surrounds all of us.

This book is not a chronicle of all or even main events during the past 
six decades. We have tried to weave the history of the last sixty years 
around some major issues and themes. The first eight chapters of the 
book cover a certain period of this history, but in a selective manner 
by focussing on one issue or theme that dominated those years. The 
final chapter offers an overview of various issues that have emerged 
in the most recent period. 

politics is often understood as a power game played by some big 
leaders. politics is, of course, about power. But politics is also about 
taking collective decisions, about sorting out differences, about 
reaching consensus. That is why we simply cannot run our collective 
affairs without politics. similarly, big leaders no doubt influence 
the course of politics. But politics is much more than a story of 
individual ambitions and frustrations. That is why you will not find 
much emphasis on personalities in this book. You will find some 
biographical sketches so as to give you a rich sense of those times. 
But we do not expect you to memorise these biographical details.

In order to give you a feel of the times, we have included many 
photographs, cartoons, maps and other images. As in other books, 
Unni and Munni are there to share their innocent yet irreverent 
questions and comments with you. By now you know that what Unni 
and Munni say is not the opinion of the textbook. You, and even 
the authors, may or may not agree with Unni and Munni.  But you 
should, like them, begin to question everything.   

This book refrains from passing judgement on events and personalities 
of this period. The objective of this book is to equip you with information 
and perspectives so that you can take more informed and well thought 
out positions on politics, either as students of political science or as 
citizens of the country. That is why we tell the story in an open-ended 
and non-partisan manner. This has not been easy, for there is no way

a book like this can side-step all the ‘controversial’ issues.  Many of 
the significant issues of this period were and continue to be subjects 
of deep political differences.

The Team that prepared this book decided to follow certain norms 
to ensure non-partisan treatment of the subject. Firstly, it presents 
more than one viewpoint when dealing with controversial subjects. 
secondly, wherever available, it uses authentic sources like the 
reports of various Commissions or court judgements, to reconstruct 
crucial details. Thirdly, it uses a variety of sources from scholarly 
writings to different newspapers and magazines, etc. to tell the story. 
Fourthly, the book avoids detailed discussion of the role of political 
leaders who are still active in politics.

Writing this textbook turned out to be particularly challenging for 
we do not have sufficient information on this period. Most of the 
archival material is still closed to the researchers. There are not many 
standard histories of this period that a textbook like this can draw 
upon. The Textbook Development Committee turned this challenge 
into an opportunity. We are grateful to the Team members who spared 
their valuable time for preparing the drafts of the various chapters. 
We would like to place on record our gratitude to professors Rekha 
Chowdhary and surinder Jodhka for contributing drafts for the 
sections on Jammu and Kashmir and punjab respectively. 

Given the significance and the sensitive nature of the book, it was 
decided to put the drafts through many rounds of scrutiny by a 
group of political scientists and historians. We decided to request 
three ‘readers’ – Dr. Ramchandra Guha, Professor Sunil Khilnani 
and Dr. Mahesh Rangarajan – to read an early draft of this text for 
accuracy and non-partisan treatment of the subject. We are very 
grateful that all of them accepted our request and took out time to 
read and comment on the drafts. Their remarks encouraged us; their 
suggestions saved us from many errors. We owe a special debt to 
Ramchandra Guha, since we have liberally drawn upon his book, 
India after Gandhi. Dr. philip Oldenberg also read parts of the book 
and made valuable comments. We were fortunate in having a group 
of eminent scholars, professors Mrinal Miri, G.p. Deshpande and 
Gopal Guru, who constituted a special sub-committee of the National 
Monitoring Committee and read the book at least thrice.  We wish 
to thank professor Krishna Kumar, Director NCERT and professor 
Hari Vasudevan, Chairperson, Advisory Committee for Textbooks,  for 
their support, advice and guidance at different stages of this delicate 
project. We are also thankful to professor Yash pal for his interest in 
and support to this book. 

We are thankful to Lokniti programme of the CsDs, Delhi which for 
the last one year provided a home and resource base for the work on 
this textbook. Various memebers of the CsDs family who went out 
of their way to support this work include sanjeer Alam, Avinash Jha,

Balaji Madiq and Himanshu Bhattacharya at Lokniti and Ravikant 
and Mohammad Qureshi at sarai. We would also like to thank the 
authorities of the philately Bureau, especially Kaveri Banerji and 
Niraj Kumar and sandhya R. Kanneganti of Indian postal service, for 
helping us to access and allowing us to reproduce a large number of 
postal stamps;  Milind Champanerkar for helping us in the selection of 
the films; Radhika Menon for critical inputs; Vipul Mudgal, Ritu and 
Dharamveer  for helping us to access the rich collection of Hindustan 
Times photo Library; Bhaanu Choube and Abhay Chhajalani for 
opening the archives of Nai Dunia; Rajendra Babu for helping us with 
clippings and images from The Hindu Library and authorities of the 
University of Michigan Library and Nehru Memorial Museum and 
Library, New Delhi.

Alex George, pankaj pushkar, K. K. Kailash, and M. Manisha formed 
the backbone of the team that worked on this book in various ways – 
doing archival research, hunting for visuals, checking facts. But for 
their multi-faceted support, and especially the untiring devotion of 
pankaj pushkar, this book would not have been what it is. We are 
thankful to Anupama Roy for her generous help with proof reading. 
The look and feel of the book is the product of the artistic skills 
of Irfaan Khan, the creator of Unni-Munni, graphics and maps by 
ARK Grafix, and the aesthetic sensibility of shweta Rao who designed 
the book. We thank them all for sharing the spirit of this project. We 
would like to place on record our gratitude to shveta Uppal, Chief 
Editor, NCERT, who went beyond the call of her duty in working with 
this book, for her exemplary patience and professionalism.

This book is a tribute to the maturity of Indian democracy and 
is intended as a small contribution to enriching the democratic 
deliberations in our country. We sincerely hope that this book will 
be received in this spirit and will be useful not only for students of 
political science but also to a wider group of young citizens of our 
country.

Rationalisation of Content  
in the Textbooks

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to 
reduce content load on students. The National Education 
Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and 
providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative 
mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken 
the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. 
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across 
classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view 
of the following:

•	 Overlapping with similar content included in other subject 
areas in the same class

•	 Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the 
same subject

•	 Difficulty	level
•	 Content, which is easily accessible to students without 

much interventions from teachers and can be learned by 
children through self-learning or peer-learning

•	 Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition is a reformatted version after carrying 
out the changes given above.

REQUEST FOR FEEDBACK

How did you like this textbook? What was your experience in reading 
or using this? What were the difficulties you faced? What changes 
would you like to see in the next version of this book?

Write to us on all these and any other matter related to the textbook. 
You could be a teacher, a parent, a student or just a general reader. 
We value any and every feedback.

chapter 1
challenges of 
nation Building
Challeng for the new nation-state
At the hour of midnight on 14-15 August 1947, India attained independence. 
Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of free India, addressed a special session of 
the Constituent Assembly that night. This was the famous ‘tryst with destiny’ speech 
that you are familiar with. 

This was the moment Indians had been waiting for.  You have read in your history 
textbooks that there were many voices in our national movement. But there were 
two goals almost everyone agreed upon: one, that after Independence, we shall run 
our country through democratic government; and two, that the government will be 
run for the good of all, particularly the poor and the socially disadvantaged groups. 
Now that the country was independent, the time had come to realise the promise of 
freedom.

This was not going to be easy. India was born as a nation-state in very difficult 
circumstances. perhaps no other country by then was born in a situation more 
difficult than that of India in 1947. Freedom came with the partition of the country. 
The year 1947 was a year of unprecedented violence and trauma of displacement. It 
was in this situation that independent India started on its journey to achieve several 
objectives. Yet the turmoil that accompanied independence did not make our leaders 
lose sight of the multiple challenges that faced the new nation.

Three Challenges 

Broadly, independent India faced three kinds of challenges. The first 
and the immediate challenge was to shape a nation that was united, 

 Tomoow we shall be yet accommodative of the diversity in our society. India was a land 
of continental size and diversity. Its people spoke different languages 

ee om the slavery  the 

“ and followed different cultures and religions. At that time it was 
British domination. But widely believed that a country full of such kinds of diversity could 
at midnight India will be not remain together for long. The partition of the country appeared to 
partitioned. Tomoow will prove everyone’s worst fears. There were serious questions about the 
thus be a day  rejoicing as future of India: Would India survive as a unified country? Would it do 

well as  mourning. so by emphasising national unity at the cost of every other objective? 
Would it mean rejecting all regional and sub-national identities? And 
there was an urgent question: How was integration of the territory of 
India to be achieved?

Mahatma Gandhi  The second challenge was to establish democracy. You have 
14 August 1947, already studied the Indian Constitution. You know that the 
Kolkata.

Constitution granted fundamental rights and extended the right to 
vote to every citizen. India adopted representative democracy based 
on the parliamentary form of government. These features ensure that 
the political competition would take place in a democratic framework.

A democratic constitution is necessary but not sufficient for 
establishing a democracy. The challenge was to develop democratic 
practices in accordance with the Constitution.

The third challenge was to ensure the development and well-
being of the entire society and not only of some sections. Here 
again the Constitution clearly laid down the principle of equality 
and special protection to socially disadvantaged groups and 
religious and cultural communities. The Constitution also set out 
in the Directive Principles of State Policy the welfare goals that 
democratic politics must achieve.  The real challenge now was to 
evolve effective policies for economic development and eradication 
of poverty.

look at how the three challenges mentioned above were faced in 
the early years after Independence.

In this chapter, we focus on the first challenge of nation-
building that occupied centre-stage in the years immediately after 
Independence.  We begin by looking at the events that formed the 
context of Independence.  This can help us understand why the 
issue of national unity and security became a primary challenge 
at the time of Independence. We shall then see how India chose to 
shape itself into a nation, united by a shared history and common 
destiny.  This unity had to reflect the aspirations of people across 
the different regions and deal with the disparities that existed 
among regions and different sections of people. In the next two 
chapters we shall turn to the challenge of establishing a democracy 
and achieving economic development with equality and justice.

Partition: displacement and rehabilitation
On 14-15 August 1947, not one but two nation-states came into 
existence – India and Pakistan.  This was a result of ‘partition’, 
the division of British India into India and Pakistan.  The drawing 
of the border demarcating the territory of each country marked the 
culmination of political developments that you have read about in 
the history textbooks. According to the ‘two-nation theory’ advanced 
by the Muslim League, India consisted of not one but two ‘people’, 
Hindus and Muslims. That is why it demanded Pakistan, a separate 
country for the Muslims. The Congress opposed this theory and the 
demand for Pakistan. But several political developments in 1940s, the 
political competition between the Congress and the Muslim League 
and the British role led to the decision for the creation of Pakistan. 

Process of Partition

Thus it was decided that what was till then known as ‘India’ 
would be divided into two countries, ‘India’ and ‘Pakistan’. Such a 
division was not only very painful, but also very difficult to decide 
and to implement. It was decided to follow the principle of religious 
majorities. This basically means that areas where the Muslims were in 
majority would make up the territory of Pakistan. The rest was to stay 
with India. 

The idea might appear simple, but it presented all kinds of 
difficulties. First of all, there was no single belt of Muslim majority 
areas in British India. There were two areas of concentration, one 
in the west and one in the east. There was no way these two parts 
could be joined. So it was decided that the new country, Pakistan, will 
comprise two territories, West and East Pakistan separated by a long 
expanse of Indian territory.  Secondly, not all Muslim majority areas 
wanted to be in Pakistan. Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, the undisputed 
leader of the North Western Frontier Province and known as ‘Frontier 
Gandhi’, was staunchly opposed to the two-nation theory. Eventually, 
his voice was simply ignored and the NWFP was made to merge 
with Pakistan. 

The third problem was that two of the Muslim majority provinces 
of British India, Punjab and Bengal, had very large areas where the 
non-Muslims were in majority. Eventually it was decided that these 
two provinces would be bifurcated according to the religious majority

sides of the border. Lakhs of Hindus and Sikhs in the areas that 
were now in Pakistan and an equally large number of Muslims on 
the Indian side of Punjab and Bengal (and to some extent Delhi and 
surrounding areas) found themselves trapped. They were to discover 
that they were undesirable aliens in their own home, in the land where 
they and their ancestors had lived for centuries. As soon as it became 
clear that the country was going to be partitioned, the violence started 
at an unprecedented level against communities who were lesser in 
number in their respective areas. No one had quite anticipated the 
scale of this problem. No one had any plans for handling this. Initially, 
the people and political leaders kept hoping that this violence was 
temporary and would be controlled soon. But very soon the violence 
went out of control. Such communities on both sides of the border 
were often compelled to leave their homes at a few hours’ notice. 

Consequences of partition

The year 1947 was the year of one of the largest, most abrupt, 
unplanned and tragic transfer of population that human history 
has known. There were killings and atrocities on both sides of the 
border. In the name of religion people of one community ruthlessly

Mahatma Gandhi’s sacrifice
On	 the	 15th	 August	 1947	 Mahatma	 Gandhi	 did	 not	
participate in any of the Independence Day celebrations. 
He was in Kolkata in the areas which were torn by 
gruesome riots between Hindus and Muslims. He was 
saddened by the communal violence and disheartened 
that the principles of ahimsa (non-violence) and 
satyagraha (active but non-violent resistance) that he 
had lived and worked for, had failed to bind the people 
in	 troubled	 times.	 Gandhiji	 went	 on	 to	 persuade	 the	
Hindus and Muslims to give up violence. His presence in 
Kolkata greatly improved the situation, and the coming 
of independence was celebrated in a spirit of communal 
harmony,	with	joyous	dancing	in	the	streets.	Gandhiji’s	
prayer meetings attracted large crowds. But this was 
short lived as riots between Hindus and Muslims erupted 
once	 again	 and	 Gandhiji	 had	 to	 resort	 to	 a	 fast	 to 	
bring peace. 

Next	month	Gandhiji	moved	to	Delhi	where	large	scale	
violence had erupted. He was deeply concerned about 
ensuring that Muslims should be allowed to stay in India 
with dignity, as equal citizens. He was also concerned 
about the relations between India and Pakistan. He was 
unhappy with what he saw as the Indian government’s 
decision not to honour its financial commitments to 
Pakistan. With all this in mind he undertook what turned 
out to be his last fast in January 1948. As in Kolkata, his 
fast had a dramatic effect in Delhi. Communal tension 
and violence reduced. Muslims of Delhi and surrounding 
areas could safely return to their homes. The Government 
of India agreed to give Pakistan its dues. 

Gandhiji’s	 actions	 were	 however	 not	 liked	 by	 all.	
Extremists in both the communities blamed him for their 
conditions. Despite this he continued to meet everyone 
during	his	prayer	meetings.	Finally,	on	30	January	1948,	
one	such	extremist,	Nathuram	Vinayak	Godse,	walked	
up	 to	Gandhiji	during	his	evening	 	prayer	 in	Delhi	and	
fired three bullets at him, killing him instantly. Thus 
ended a lifelong struggle for truth, non-violence, justice 
and tolerance.

equally and that India should not be a country that gave superior 
status to adherents of one faith and inferior to those who practiced 
another religion. All citizens would be equal irrespective of their 
religious affiliation.  Being religious or a believer would not be a test 
of citizenship. They cherished therefore the ideal of a secular nation. 
This ideal was enshrined in the Indian Constitution.

Shweta noticed that her Nana (maternal grandfather) would get very 
quiet whenever anyone mentioned Pakistan. One day she decided to 
ask him about it. Her Nana told her about how he moved from Lahore to 
Ludhiana during Partition. Both his parents were killed. Even he would 
not have survived, but a neighbouring Muslim family gave him shelter 
and kept him in hiding for several days. They helped him find some 
relatives and that is how he managed to cross the border and start 
a new life. Similarly, there are many examples of Hindu families and 
others who helped, sheltered, and saved the lives of Muslim families 
during the times of crisis and violence caused by Partition. It shows the 
importance of compassion and solidarity on religious grounds in both 
communities.
Have you heard a similar story? Ask your grandparents or anyone of 
that generation about their memories of Independence Day, about the 
celebration, about the trauma of Partition, about the expectations they 
had from independence.  

Write down at least two of these stories. 

Integration  Princely Stat
British India was divided into what were called the British Indian 
Provinces and the Princely States. The British Indian Provinces 
were directly under the control of the British government. On the 
other hand, several large and small states ruled by princes, called 
the Princely States, enjoyed some form of control over their internal 
affairs as long as they accepted British supremacy. This was called 
paramountcy or suzerainty of the British crown. Princely States 
covered one-third of the land area of the British Indian Empire and 
one out of four Indians lived under princely rule.  

The problem

Just before Independence it was announced by the British that with 
the end of their rule over India, paramountcy of the British crown 
over Princely States would also lapse. This meant that all these 
states, as many as 565 in all, would become legally independent. The 
British government took the view that all these states were free to 
join either India or Pakistan or remain independent if they so wished. 
This decision was left not to the people but to the princely rulers of 
these states. This was a very serious problem and could threaten the 
very existence of a united India.

The problems started very soon. First of all, the ruler of Travancore 
announced that the state had decided on Independence. The Nizam

of Hyderabad made a similar announcement the next day. Rulers like 
the Nawab of Bhopal were averse to joining the Constituent Assembly. 
This response of the rulers of the Princely States meant that after 
Independence there was a very real possibility that India would get 
further divided into a number of small countries. The prospects of 
democracy for the people in these states also looked bleak. This was a 
strange situation, since the Indian Independence was aimed at unity, 
self-determination as well as democracy. In most of these princely 
states, governments were run in a non-democratic manner and the 
rulers were unwilling to give democratic rights to their populations.

Reorganisation  Stat
The process of nation-building did not come to an end with Partition 
and integration of Princely States. Now the challenge was to draw the 
internal boundaries of the Indian states. This was not just a matter 
of administrative divisions.  The boundaries had to be drawn in a way 
so that the linguistic and cultural plurality of the country could be 
reflected without affecting the unity of the nation. 

During colonial rule, the state boundaries were drawn either on 
administrative convenience or simply coincided with the territories 
annexed by the British government or the territories ruled by the 
princely powers. 

Our national movement had rejected these divisions as artificial 
and had promised the linguistic principle as the basis of formation 
of states. In fact after the Nagpur session of Congress in 1920 the 
principle was recognised as the basis of the reorganisation of the 
Indian National Congress party itself.  Many Provincial Congress 
Committees were created by linguistic zones, which did not follow 
the administrative divisions of British India.  

Things changed after Independence and Partition. Our leaders

(as the movement for a separate Andhra was called) demanded that

province of which they were a part and be made into a separate Andhra January1948
province. Nearly all the political forces in the Andhra region were in 
favour of linguistic reorganisation of the then Madras province. 

The movement gathered momentum as a result of the Central 
government’s vacillation. Potti Sriramulu, a Congress leader and a 
veteran Gandhian, went on an indefinite fast that led to his death after 
56 days. This caused great unrest and resulted in violent outbursts in 
Andhra region. People in large numbers took to the streets. Many were 
injured or lost their lives in police firing.  In Madras, several legislators 
resigned their seats in protest. Finally, the Prime Minister announced 
the formation of a separate Andhra state in December 1952.

“Struggle for Survival” (26 July 1953) captures contemporary impression of the 
demand for linguistic states

The formation of Andhra spurred the struggle for 
making of other states on linguistic lines in other parts 
of the country. These struggles forced the Central 
Government into appointing a States reorganisation 
Commission in 1953 to look into the question of 
redrawing of the boundaries of states. The Commission 
in its report accepted that the boundaries of the state 
should reflect the boundaries of different languages.  On 
the basis of its report the States reorganisation Act was 
passed in 1956.  This led to the creation of 14 states and Potti Sriramulu  
six union territories. (1901-1952):		Gandhian

“Coaxing the Genie back” (5 February 1956) asked if the State reorganisation Commission could 
contain the genie of linguism.

One of the most important concerns in the early years 
was that demands for separate states would endanger 
the unity of the country. It was felt that linguistic 
states may foster separatism and create pressures on 
the newly founded nation. But the leadership, under 
popular pressure, finally made a choice in favour of 
linguistic states. It was hoped that if we accept the 
regional and linguistic claims of all regions, the threat of 
division and separatism would be reduced. Besides, the 
accommodation of regional demands and the formation 
of linguistic states were also seen as more democratic. 

Now it is more than fifty years since the formation of 
linguistic states. We can say that linguistic states and 
the movements for the formation of these states changed 
the nature of democratic politics and leadership in some 
basic ways. The path to politics and power was now 
open to people other than the small English speaking 
elite. Linguistic reorganisation also gave some uniform 
basis to the drawing of state boundaries. It did not lead

to disintegration of the country as many had feared earlier. On the 
contrary it strengthened national unity.  

Above all, the linguistic states underlined the acceptance of the 
principle of diversity. When we say that India adopted democracy, it 
does not simply mean that India embraced a democratic constitution, 
nor does it merely mean that India adopted the format of elections. The 
choice was larger than that. It was a choice in favour of recognising 
and accepting the existence of differences which could at times be 
oppositional.  Democracy, in other words, was associated with plurality 
of ideas and ways of life.  Much of the politics in the later period was 
to take place within this framework. 

Fast Forward   Creation of new states

The acceptance of the principle of linguistic states did not mean, however, that all states 
immediately became linguistic states. There was an experiment of ‘bilingual’ Bombay state, 
consisting	 of	 Gujarati-	 and	 Marathi-speaking	 people.	 After	 a	 popular	 agitation,	 the	 states	 of	
Maharashtra	and	Gujarat	were	created	in	1960.	
In Punjab also, there were two linguistic groups: Hindi-speaking and Punjabi-speaking. The 
Punjabi-speaking people demanded a separate state. But it was not granted with other states 
in 1956. Statehood for Punjab came ten years later, in 1966, when the territories of today’s 
Haryana and Himachal Pradesh were separated from the larger Punjab state.  

Another major reorganisation of states took place in the north-east in 1972. Meghalaya was 
carved out of Assam in 1972.  Manipur and Tripura too emerged as separate states in the same 
year. The states of Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh came into being in 1987. Nagaland had 
become a state much earlier in 1963. 

Language did not, however, remain the sole basis of organisation of states. In later years 
sub-regions raised demands for separate states on the basis of a separate regional culture or 
complaints of regional imbalance in development. Three such states, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand 
and	Jharkhand,	were	created	in	2000.	Telangana	has	emerged	as	a	new	state	on	2	June,	2014.	
The story of reorganisation has not come to an end. There are many regions in the country 
where there are movements demanding separate and smaller states. These include Vidarbha 
in Maharashtra, Harit Pradesh in the western region of Uttar Pradesh and the northern region 
of West Bengal.

But the Election Commission discovered that it was not going to 
be easy to hold a free and fair election in a country of India’s size. 
Holding an election required delimitation or drawing the boundaries 
of the electoral constituencies. It also required preparing the electoral 
rolls, or the list of all the citizens eligible to vote. Both these tasks took 
a lot of time. When the first draft of the rolls was published, it was 
discovered that the names of nearly 40 lakh women were not recorded 
in the list. They were simply listed as “wife of …” or “daughter of …”.

Changing methods of voting 

 
These days we use an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) to record voters’ 
preferences. But that is not how we started. In the first general election, it 
was decided to place inside each polling booth a box for each candidate 
with the election symbol of that candidate. Each voter was given a blank 
ballot paper which they had to drop into the box of the candidate they 
wanted to vote for. About 20 lakh steel boxes were used for this purpose. 
A presiding officer from Punjab described how he 
prepared the ballot boxes—“Each box had to have 
its candidate’s symbol, both inside and outside it, 
and outside on either side, had to be displayed the 
name of the candidate in Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi 
along with the number of the constituency, the

After the first two elections, this method was changed. Now the ballot paper

India’s general election of 1952 became a landmark in the

of the national movement. It was the only party then to have an 
organisation spread all over the country. And finally, in Jawaharlal 
Nehru, the party had the most popular and charismatic leader in 
Indian politics. He led the Congress campaign and toured through 
the country. When the final results were declared, the extent of the 
victory of the Congress did surprise many. The party won 364 of the

challenger. The Communist Party of India that came next in terms

Lok Sabha elections. The Congress scored 
big victory in those elections as well. It won 
a majority of seats in all the states except 
Travancore-Cochin (part of today’s Kerala), 
Madras and Orissa. Finally even in these 
states the Congress formed the government. 
So the party ruled all over the country at the 
national and the state level. As expected, 
Jawaharlal Nehru became the Prime Minister 
after the first general election. 

A look at the electoral map on the 
previous page would give you a sense of 
the dominance of the Congress during 
the period 1952-1962. In the second and 
the third general elections, held in 1957 
and 1962 respectively,  the Congress 
maintained the same position in the Lok 
Sabha by winning three-fourth of the 
seats. None of the opposition parties 
could win even one-tenth of the number 
of seats won by the Congress. In the state 

assembly elections, the Congress did not get 
majority in a few cases. The most significant 

of these cases was in Kerala in 1957 when a coalition led by the 
CPI formed the government. Apart from exceptions like this, the

The extent of the victory of the Congress was artificially 
boosted by our electoral system. The Congress won three out of

for example, the Congress obtained 45 per cent of the total votes.

Communist viory in Kerala
As early as in 1957, the Congress party had the bitter taste of defeat in Kerala. 
In the assembly elections held in March 1957, the Communist Party won the 
largest number of seats in the Kerala legislature. The party won 60 of the 
126 seats and had the support of five independents. The governor invited 
E. M. S. Namboodiripad, the leader of the Communist legislature party, to form 
the ministry.  For the first time in the world, a Communist party government 
had come to power through democratic elections. 

On losing power in the State, the Congress party began a ‘liberation struggle’ 
against the elected government. The CPI had come to power on the promise of 
carrying out radical and progressive policy measures. The Communists claimed 
that the agitation was led by vested interests and religious organisations. 
In 1959 the Congress government at 
the Centre dismissed the Communist 
government in Kerala under Article 356 of 
the Constitution. This decision proved very 
controversial and was widely cited as one 
of the prominent instances of the misuse 
of constitutional emergency powers.

Socialist Party (SP)
The origins of the Socialist Party can be traced 
back to the mass movement stage of the Indian 
National Congress in the pre-independence era. 
The Congress Socialist Party (CSP) was formed 
within the Congress in 1934 by a group of young 
leaders who wanted a more radical and egalitarian 
Congress. In 1948, the Congress amended its 
constitution to prevent its members from having a 
dual party membership. This forced the Socialists to 
form a separate Socialist Party in 1948. The Party’s 
electoral performance caused much disappointment 
to its supporters. Although the Party had presence in 
most of the states of India, it could achieve electoral 
success only in a few pockets.

The socialists believed in 
the ideology of democratic 
socialism which distinguished 
them both from the Congress as 
well as from the Communists. 
They criticised the Congress 
for favouring capitalists and 
landlords and for ignoring the 
workers and the peasants. But 
the socialists faced a dilemma 
when in 1955 the Congress declared its goal to be the 
socialist pattern of society. Thus it became difficult for the

were formed only around Independence or after that. Thus, 
the Congress had the ‘first off the blocks’ advantage.  By 
the time of Independence the party had not only spread 
across the length and breadth of the country as we had 
seen in the maps but also had an organisational network 
down to the local level. Most importantly, as the Congress 
was till recently a national movement, its nature was

The Communist Party  India (CPI)
In the early 1920s communist groups 
emerged in different parts of India taking 
inspiration from the Bolshevik revolution 
in Russia and advocating socialism as the 
solution to problems affecting the country. 
From 1935, the Communists worked mainly 
from within the fold of the Indian National 
Congress.  A parting of ways took place in 
December 1941, when the Communists 
decided to support the British in their war 
against Nazi Germany. Unlike other non-
Congress parties the CPI had a well-oiled 
party machinery and dedicated cadre 
at the time of Independence. However, 
Independence raised different voices in 
the party. The basic question that troubled 
the party was the nature 
of Indian independence. 
Was India really free or 
was freedom a sham?  

Soon after Independence, 
the party thought that the transfer of power in 1947 
was not  true independence and encouraged violent 
uprisings in Telangana. The Communists failed to 
generate popular support for their position and were 
crushed by the armed forces.  This forced them to 
rethink their position. In 1951 the Communist Party 
abandoned the path of violent revolution and decided

the Congress. Since there was room within the party for various 
factions to fight with each other, it meant that leaders representing 
different interests and ideologies remained within the Congress 
rather than go out and form a new party.  

Most of the state units of the Congress were made up of 
numerous factions. The factions took different ideological positions 
making the Congress appear as a grand centrist party. The other 
parties primarily attempted to influence these factions and thereby 
indirectly influenced policy and decision making from the “margins”. 
They were far removed from the actual exercise of authority. They 
were not alternatives to the ruling party; instead they constantly 
pressurised and criticised, censured and influenced the Congress. 
The system of factions functioned as balancing mechanism within 
the ruling party. Political competition therefore took place within the 
Congress. In that sense, in the first decade of electoral competition

As we have noted above, it is not that India did 
not have opposition parties during this period. 
While discussing the results of the elections, 
we have already come across the names of 
many parties other than the Congress. Even 
then India had a larger number of diverse and 
vibrant opposition parties than many other 
multi-party democracies. Some of these had 
come into being even before the first general 
election of 1952. Some of these parties played 
an important part in the politics of the country 
in the ’sixties and ’seventies. The roots of almost 
all the non-Congress parties of today can be 
traced to one or the other of the opposition 
parties of the 1950s.

All these opposition parties succeeded in 
gaining only a token representation in the

period. Yet their presence played a crucial role

As the global demand for steel increases, Orissa, which has one of 
the largest reserves of untapped iron ore in the country, is being 
seen as an important investment destination. The State government 
hopes to cash in on this unprecedented demand for iron ore and 
has signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with both 
international and domestic steel makers. The government believes 
that this would bring in necessary capital investment and proivde a 
lot of employment opportunities. The iron ore resources lie in some 
of the most underdeveloped and predominantly tribal districts of the 
state. The tribal population fears that the setting up of industries 
would mean displacement from their home and livelihood. The 
environmentalists fear that mining and industry would 
pollute the environment. The central government feels Orissa villagers protest

had political consequence. Most of these issues involved political 
judgement and required consultations among political parties and 
approval of the public. That is why we need to study the process of 
development as a part of the history of politics in India.    

Ideas of development

Very often this contestation involves the very idea of development. The 
example of Orissa shows us that it is not enough to say that everyone 
wants development. For ‘development’ has different meanings for 
different sections of the people. Development would mean different 
things for example, to an industrialist who is planning to set up a 
steel plant, to an urban consumer of steel and to the Adivasi who 
lives in that region.  Thus any discussion on development is bound to 
generate contradictions, conflicts and debates. 

The first decade after Independence witnessed a lot of debate 
around this question. It was common then, as it is even now, for people 
to refer to the ‘West’  as the standard for measuring development. 
‘Development’ was about becoming more ‘modern’ and modern was 
about becoming more like the industrialised countries of the West. This 
is how common people as well as the experts thought.  It was believed 
that every country would go through the process of modernisation 
as in the West, which involved the breakdown of traditional social 
structures and the rise of capitalism and liberalism. Modernisation 
was also associated with the ideas of growth, material progress 
and scientific rationality.  This kind of idea of development allowed

between the two super powers. There were many in India then who 
were deeply impressed by the Soviet model of development. These 
included not just the leaders of the Communist Party of India, but 
also those of the Socialist Party and leaders like Nehru within the 
Congress. There were very few supporters of the American style 
capitalist development. 

This reflected a broad consensus that had developed during 
the national movement.  The nationalist leaders were clear that the 
economic concerns of the government of free India would  have to 
be different from the narrowly defined commercial functions of the 
colonial government. It was clear, moreover, that the task of poverty 
alleviation and social and economic redistribution was being seen 
primarily as the responsibility of the government.    There were debates 
among them. For some, industrialisation seemed to be the preferred 
path.  For others, the development of agriculture and in particular 
alleviation of rural poverty was the priority. 

Planning

Despite the various differences, there was a consensus on one point: 
that development could not be left to private actors, that there was the 
need for the government to develop a design or plan for development.

In fact the idea of planning as a process of rebuilding economy earned 
a good deal of public support in the 1940s and 1950s all over the 
world. The experience of Great Depression in Europe, the inter-war 
reconstruction of Japan and Germany, and most of all the spectacular 
economic growth against heavy odds in the Soviet Union in the 1930s 
and 1940s contributed to this consensus.

Thus the Planning Commission was not a sudden invention. In fact, 
it has a very interesting history. We commonly assume that private 
investors, such as industrialists and big business entrepreneurs, 
are averse to ideas of planning: they seek an open economy without 
any state control in the flow of capital. That was not what happened 
here. Rather, a section of the big industrialists got together in 1944 
and drafted a joint proposal for setting up a planned economy in the 
country. It was called the Bombay Plan. The Bombay Plan wanted 
the state to take major initiatives in industrial and other economic 
investments. Thus, from left to right, planning for development was 
the most obvious choice for the country after Independence. Soon 
after India became independent, the Planning Commission came into 
being. The Prime Minister was its Chairperson. It became the most 
influential and central machinery for deciding what path and strategy 
India would adopt for its development. 


e Early  Initiativ	
As in the USSR, the Planning Commission of India opted for five year 
plans (FYP). The idea is very simple: the Government of India prepares 
a document that has a plan for all its income and expenditure for the 
next five years.  Accordingly the budget of the central and all the State 

governments is divided into two parts: ‘non-plan’ budget that is spent 
on routine items on a yearly basis and ‘plan’ budget that is spent on

a five year basis as per the priorities fixed by the plan.  A five year 
plan has the advantage of permitting the government to focus on 
the larger picture and make long-term intervention in the economy.

The draft of the First Five Year Plan and then the actual Plan 
Document, released in December 1951, generated a lot of excitement 
in the country. People from all walks of life – academics, journalists, 
government and private sector employees, industrialists, farmers, 
politicians etc. – discussed and debated the documents extensively. 
The excitement with planning reached its peak with the launching 
of the Second Five Year Plan in 1956 and continued somewhat 
till the Third Five Year Plan in 1961. The Fourth Plan was due to 
start in 1966. By this time, the novelty of planning had declined 
considerably, and moreover, India was facing acute economic 
crisis. The government decided to take a ‘plan holiday’. Though 
many criticisms emerged both about the process and the priorities 
of these plans, the foundation of India’s economic development was

The First Five Year Plan

The First Five Year Plan (1951–1956) sought to get the country’s 
economy out of the cycle of poverty. K.N. Raj, a young economist 
involved in drafting the plan, argued that India should ‘hasten 
slowly’ for the first two decades as a fast rate of development 
might endanger democracy. The First Five Year Plan addressed, 
mainly, the agrarian sector including investment in dams and 
irrigation. Agricultural sector was hit hardest by Partition and 
needed urgent attention. Huge allocations were made for large-
scale projects like the Bhakhra Nangal Dam. The Plan identified 
the pattern of land distribution in the country as the principal 
obstacle in the way of agricultural growth. It focused on land 
reforms as the key to the country’s development.

Tenth Five Year Plan 

One of the basic aims of the planners was to raise the level of document

national income, which could be possible only if the people saved 
more money than they spent. As the basic level of spending was 
very low in the 1950s, it could not be reduced any more. So the 
planners sought to push savings up. That too was difficult as 
the total capital stock in the country was rather low compared 
to the total number of employable people. Nevertheless, people’s 
savings did rise in the first phase of the planned process until 
the end of the Third Five Year Plan. But, the rise was not as 
spectacular as was expected at the beginning of the First Plan. 
Later, from the early 1960s till the early 1970s, the proportion of 
savings in the country actually dropped consistently. 

Rapid Industrialisation

The Second FYP stressed on heavy industries. It was drafted 
by a team of economists and planners under the leadership of 
P. C. Mahalanobis. If the first plan had preached patience, the

It, however, had its problems as well. India was technologically 
backward, so it had to spend precious foreign exchange to buy 
technology from the global market. That apart, as industry attracted 
more investment than agriculture, the possibility of food shortage 
loomed large. The Indian planners found balancing industry and 
agriculture really difficult. The Third Plan was not significantly 
different from the Second. Critics pointed out that the plan 
strategies from this time around displayed an unmistakable 
“urban bias”. Others thought that industry was wrongly given 
priority over agriculture. There were also those who wanted focus on 
agriculture-related industries rather than heavy ones.

India was born as an independent nation-state in a very trying 
and challenging international context. The world had witnessed a 
devastating war and was grappling with issues of reconstruction; yet 
another attempt to establish an international body was underway; 
many new countries were emerging as a result of the collapse of 
colonialism; and most new nations were trying to come to terms with 
the twin challenges of welfare and democracy. Free India’s foreign 
policy reflected all these concerns in the period immediately after 
Independence. Apart from these factors at the global level, India 
had its own share of concerns. The British government left behind 
the legacy of many international disputes; partition created its own

its foreign policy, the Cold war was just beginning and the world 
was getting divided into these two camps. Did India belong to any of 
these two camps in global politics of the fifties and the sixties? was 
it successful in conducting its foreign policy peacefully and avoiding 
international conflicts? 

e Policy  non-alignment
The Indian national movement was not an isolated process. It was a 
part of the worldwide struggle against colonialism and imperialism. 
It influenced the liberation movements of many Asian and African 
countries. prior to India’s Independence, there were contacts between 
the nationalist leaders of India and those of other colonies, united 
as they were in their common struggle against colonialism and 
imperialism. The creation of the Indian National Army (INA) by Netaji 
Subhash Chandra Bose during the Second world war was the clearest 
manifestation of the linkages established between India and overseas 
Indians during the freedom struggle.

The foreign policy of a nation reflects the interplay of domestic 
and external factors. Therefore, the noble ideals that inspired India’s 
struggle for freedom influenced the making of its foreign policy. But

China, and the beginning of decolonisation. So India’s leadership had 
to pursue its national interests within the prevailing international 
context.

Nehru’s role

The first prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru played a crucial role in 
setting the national agenda. He was his own foreign minister. Thus 
both as the prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, he exercised 
profound influence in the formulation and implementation of India’s 
foreign policy from 1946 to 1964. The three major objectives of 
Nehru’s foreign policy were to preserve the hard-earned sovereignty, 
protect territorial integrity, and promote rapid economic development. 
Nehru wished to achieve these objectives through the strategy of non-
alignment. There were, of course, parties and groups in the country 
that believed that India should be more friendly with the bloc led by 
the US because that bloc claimed to be pro-democracy. Among those                  Our general

Two developments strained this relationship. China annexed Tibet in 
1950 and thus removed a historical buffer between the two countries.

Aksai-chin area in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir and 
much of the state of Arunachal Pradesh in what was then called 
NEFA (North Eastern Frontier Agency). Between 1957 and 1959, 
the Chinese occupied the Aksai-chin area and built a strategic road 
there. Despite a very long correspondence and discussion among top 
leaders, these differences could not be resolved. Several small border 
skirmishes between the armies of the two countries took place.

 Around this time, while the entire world’s attention was on the 
Cuban Missile crisis involving the two superpowers, China launched 
a swift and massive invasion in October 1962 on both the disputed 
regions. The first attack lasted one week and Chinese forces captured 
some key areas in Arunachal Pradesh. The second wave of attack 
came next month. While the Indian forces could block the Chinese 
advances on the western front in Ladakh, in the east the Chinese

Wars and Peace with Pakistan
In the case of Pakistan, the conflict started just after Partition over 
the dispute on Jammu and Kashmir. You will read more about the 
dispute in Chapter 7. A proxy war broke out between the Indian and 
Pakistani armies in Jammu and Kashmir during 1947 itself. But this 
did not turn into a full war. The issue was then referred to the UN. 
Pakistan soon emerged as a critical factor in India’s relations with the 
US and subsequently with China. 

The Kashmir conflict did not prevent cooperation between the 
governments of India and Pakistan. Both the governments worked 
together to restore the women abducted during Partition to their 
original families. A long-term dispute about the sharing of river 
waters was resolved through mediation by the World Bank. The India-
Pakistan Indus Waters Treaty was signed by Nehru and General Ayub 
Khan in 1960. Despite all ups and downs in the Indo-Pak relations, 
this treaty has worked well. 

A more serious armed conflict between the two countries began 
in 1965. As you would read in the next chapter, by then Lal Bahadur 
Shastri had taken over as the Prime Minister. In April 1965 Pakistan 
launched armed attacks in the Rann of Kutch area of Gujarat. This 
was followed by a bigger offensive in Jammu and Kashmir in August-
September. Pakistani rulers were hoping to get support from the local 
population there, but it did not happen. In order to ease the pressure 
on the Kashmir front, Shastri ordered Indian troops to launch a 
counter-offensive on the Punjab border. In a fierce battle, the Indian 
army reached close to Lahore. 

The hostilities came to an end with the UN intervention. Later, 
Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistan’s General 
Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Agreement, brokered by the Soviet 
Union, in January 1966. Though India could inflict considerable 
military loss on Pakistan, the 1965 war added to India’s already

1971. In order to counter the US-Pakistan-China axis, India signed a 
20-year Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the Soviet Union in 
August 1971. This treaty assured India of Soviet support if the country 
faced any attack. 

After months of diplomatic tension and military build-up, a 
full-scale war between India and Pakistan broke out in December 
1971. Pakistani aircrafts attacked Punjab and Rajasthan, while the 
army moved on the Jammu and Kashmir front. India retaliated with 
an attack involving the air force, navy and the army on both the 
Western and the Eastern front. Welcomed and supported by the local 
population, the Indian army made rapid progress in East Pakistan. 
Within ten days the Indian army had surrounded Dhaka from three 
sides and the Pakistani army of about 90,000 had to surrender. With 
Bangladesh as a free country, India declared a unilateral ceasefire. 
Later, the signing of the Shimla Agreement between Indira Gandhi and 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on 3 July 1972 formalised the return of peace. 

A decisive victory in the war led to national jubiliation. Most people 
in India saw this as a moment of glory and a clear sign of India’s

further after the 1971 war. After the war, assembly elections in most 
States took place, bringing large majorities for the Congress party in 
many states.

India, with its limited resources, had initiated development 
planning. However, conflicts with neighbours derailed the five-year 
plans. The scarce resources were diverted to the defence sector especially 
after 1962, as India had to embark on a military modernisation drive. 
The Department of Defence Production was established in November 
1962 and the Department of Defence Supplies in November 1965. 
The Third Plan (1961-66) was affected and it was followed by three 
Annual Plans and the Fourth Plan could be initiated only in 1969. 
India’s defence expenditure increased enormously after the wars.

India’s nuclear policy
Another crucial development of this period was the first nuclear 
explosion undertaken by India in May 1974. Nehru had always put 
his faith in science and technology for rapidly building a modern 
India. A significant component of his industrialisation plans was the 
nuclear programme initiated in the late 1940s under the guidance of 
Homi J. Bhabha. India wanted to generate atomic energy for peaceful 
purposes. Nehru was against nuclear weapons. So he pleaded with 
the superpowers for comprehensive nuclear disarmament. However, 
the nuclear arsenal kept rising. When Communist China conducted 
nuclear tests in October 1964, the five nuclear weapon powers, the 
US, USSR, UK, France, and China (Taiwan then represented China)  – 
also the five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council – tried to 
impose the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 on the rest 
of the world. India always considered the NPT as discriminatory and 
had refused to sign it. When India conducted its first nuclear test, it 
was termed as peaceful explosion. India argued that it was committed 
to the policy of using nuclear power only for peaceful purposes. 

I am The period when the nuclear test was conducted was a difficult 
confused! Isn’t period in domestic politics. Following the Arab-Israel War of 1973, the 
it all about atom 

bombs? Why don’t entire world was affected by the Oil Shock due to the massive hike in

resulting in high inflation. As you will read in Chapter Six, many 
agitations were going on in the country around this time, including a 
nationwide railway strike. 

Although there are minor differences among political parties about 
how to conduct external relations, Indian politics is generally marked 
by a broad agreement among the parties on national integration, 
protection of international boundaries, and on questions of national 
interest. Therefore, we find that in the course of the decade of 
1962-1971, when India faced three wars, or even later, when different 
parties came to power from time to time, foreign policy has played 
only a limited role in party politics.

Fast Forward   India’s Nuclear Programme

India has opposed the international treaties aimed at non-proliferation since 
they were selectively applicable to the non-nuclear powers and legitimised 
the monopoly of the five nuclear weapons powers. Thus, India opposed 
the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 and also refused to sign the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). 

India conducted a series of nuclear tests in May 1998, demonstrating its 
capacity to use nuclear energy for military purposes. Pakistan soon followed, 
thereby increasing the vulnerability of the region to a nuclear exchange. The 
international community was extremely critical of the nuclear tests in the 
subcontinent and sanctions were imposed on both India and Pakistan, which 
were subsequently waived. India’s nuclear doctrine of credible minimum 
nuclear deterrence professes “no first use” and reiterates India’s commitment 
to global, verifiable and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament leading to a 
nuclear weapons free world.

Shifting alliances in world politics
As you will read in Chapter Six and also in Chapter Eight, many non-Congress governments 
came to power in the period starting 1977. This was also the time when world politics was 
changing dramatically. What did it mean for India’s external relations? 

The Janata Party government that came to power in 1977 announced that it would 
follow genuine non-alignment. This implied that the pro-Soviet tilt in the foreign policy 
will be corrected. Since then, all governments (Congress or non-Congress) have taken 
initiatives for restoring better relations with China and entering into close ties with US. In 
Indian politics and in popular mind, India’s foreign policy is always very closely linked to 
two questions. One is India’s stand vis-à-vis Pakistan and the other is Indo-US relations. 
In the post-1990 period the ruling parties have often been criticised for their pro-US 
foreign policy.  

Foreign policy is always dictated by ideas of national interest. In the period after 1990, 
Russia, though it continues to be an important friend of India, has lost its global pre-
eminence. Therefore, India’s foreign policy has shifted to a more pro-US strategy. Besides, 
the contemporary international situation is more influenced by economic interests than by 
military interests. This has also made an impact on India’s foreign policy choices. At the 
same time, Indo-Pakistan relations have witnessed many new developments during this 
period. While Kashmir continues to be the main issue between the two countries, there 
have been many efforts to restore normal relations. This means that cultural exchanges, 
movement of citizens and economic cooperation would be encouraged by both countries.

In Chapter Two we read about the emergence of the Congress 
system. This system was first challenged during the 1960s. As political 
competition became more intense, the Congress found it difficult to 
retain its dominance. It faced challenges from the opposition that was 
more powerful and less divided than before. The Congress also faced 
challenges from within, as the party could no longer accommodate all

Challenge  Political Succion 
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru passed away in May 1964. He 
had been unwell for more than a year. This had generated a lot of 
speculation about the usual question of succession: after Nehru, 
who? But in a newly independent country like India, this situation 
gave rise to a more serious question: after Nehru, what?

The second question arose from the serious doubts that many When 

outsiders had about whether India’s democratic experiment will France 

survive after Nehru. It was feared that like so many other newly or Canada have

It took some time before the new Prime Minister could settle down. 
While Indira Gandhi had been politically active for very long, she had 
served as a minister under Lal Bahadur Shastri only for a short period. 
The senior Congress leaders may have supported Indira Gandhi in the 
belief that her administrative and political inexperience would compel 
her to be dependent on them for support and guidance.  Within a 
year of becoming Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi had to lead the party 
in a Lok Sabha election. Around this time, the economic situation in 
the country had further deteriorated, adding to her problems. Faced 
with these difficulties, she set out to gain control over the party and 
to demonstrate her leadership skills.

Fourth General Eleions, 1967 
The year 1967 is considered a landmark year in India’s political and 
electoral history. In Chapter Two you read about how the Congress 
party was the dominant political force throughout the country from 
1952 onwards. This trend was to undergo significant changes with 
the 1967 elections. 

Context of the elections

In the years leading up to the fourth general elections, the country 
witnessed major changes. Two Prime Ministers had died in quick 
succession, and the new Prime Minister, who was being seen as a 
political novice, had been in office for less than a year.  You will recall 
from the discussion in Chapter Three and in the previous section of 
this chapter that the period was fraught with grave economic crisis 
resulting from successive failure of monsoons, widespread drought,

The dramatic nature of the political change would be more 
apparent to you at the State level. The Congress lost majority in as 
many as seven States.  In two other States defections prevented it 
from forming a government. These nine States where the Congress 
lost power were spread across the country – Punjab, Haryana, Uttar 
Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Orissa, Madras and 
Kerala. In Madras State (now called Tamil Nadu), a regional party — 
the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) – came to power by securing 
a clear majority.  The DMK won power after having led a massive 
anti-Hindi agitation by students against the centre on the issue of 
imposition of Hindi as the official language. This was the first time any 
non-Congress party had secured a majority of its own in any State. In 
the other eight States, coalition governments consisting of different 
non-Congress parties were formed. A popular saying was that one 
could take a train from Delhi to Howrah and not pass through a 
single Congress ruled State. It was a strange feeling for those who 
were used to seeing the Congress in power. So, was the domination 
of the Congress over?

were  ideologically incongruent. The SVD government in Bihar, for 
instance, included the two socialist parties – SSP and the PSP – along 
with the CPI on the left and Jana Sangh on the right. In Punjab it 
was called the ‘Popular United Front’ and comprised the two rival 
Akali parties at that time – Sant group and the Master group – with 
both the communist parties – the CPI and the CPI(M), the SSP, the 
Republican Party and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh.

Defection

Another important feature of the politics after the 1967 election was the 
role played by defections in  the making and unmaking of governments 
in the States. Defection means an elected representative leaves the 
party on whose symbol he/she was elected and joins another party. 
After the 1967 general election, the breakaway Congress legislators 
played an important role in installing non-Congress governments in 
three States - Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.  The 
constant realignments and shifting political loyalties in this period 
gave rise to the expression ‘Aya Ram, Gaya Ram’. 

 The story of ‘Aya Ram, Gaya Ram’

The	 expression	 ‘aya	 ram,	 gaya	 ram’	 became	
popular in the political vocabulary in India 
to describe the practice of frequent floor-
crossing by legislators.  Literally translated the 
terms meant, Ram came and Ram went.  The 
expression	 originated	 in	 an	 amazing	 feat	 of	
floor	 crossing	 achieved	 by	 Gaya	 Lal,	 an	 MLA	 in	
Haryana, in 1967. He  changed his party thrice in 
a fortnight, from Congress to United Front, back to 
Congress	and	then	within	nine	hours	to	United	Front	again!		It	is	said	that	when	Gaya	Lal	declared	
his intention to quit the United Front and join the Congress, the Congress leader, Rao Birendra 
Singh	brought	him	to	Chandigarh	press	and	declared	“Gaya	Ram	was	now	Aya	Ram”.	
Gaya	Lal’s	feat	was	immortalised	in	the	phrase	“Aya	Ram,	Gaya	Ram”	which	became	the	subject	
of numerous jokes and cartoons. Later, the Constitution was amended to prevent defections.

This grant was called the privy purse. At the time of accession, there was little criticism of these

The split in the Congress reduced Indira Gandhi Government to a 
minority. Yet her government continued in office with the issue-based 
support of a few other parties including the Communist Party of India 
and the DMK. During this period the government made conscious 
attempts to project its socialist credentials.  This was also a phase  when 
Indira Gandhi vigorously campaigned for implementing the existing 
land reform laws and  undertook  further land ceiling legislation.  In 
order to end her dependence on other political parties, strengthen 
her party’s position in the Parliament, and seek a popular mandate 
for her programmes, Indira Gandhi’s government recommended the 
dissolution of the Lok Sabha in December 1970. This was another 
surprising and bold move.  The fifth general election to Lok Sabha 
were held in February 1971.  

The contest

The electoral contest appeared to be loaded against Congress(R). 
After all, the new Congress was just one faction of an already weak 
party. Everyone believed that the real organisational strength of the 
Congress party was under the command of Congress(O). To make 
matters worse for Indira Gandhi, all the major non-communist, 
non-Congress opposition parties formed an electoral alliance known 
as the Grand Alliance. The Samyukta Socialist Party (SSP), Praja 
Socialist Party (PSP), Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), Swatantra 
Party (SWA) and the Bharatiya Kranti Dal (BKD) came together 
under this umbrella. The ruling party had an alliance with the 
Communist Party of India (CPI).

Yet the new Congress had something that its big opponents 
lacked – it had an issue, an agenda and a positive slogan. The Grand 

Almost four Alliance did not have a coherent political programme. Indira Gandhi

only an election (Remove Poverty). She focused on the growth of the public sector, 
gimmick? imposition of ceiling on rural land holdings and urban property, 

removal of disparities in income and opportunity, and abolition 
of princely privileges. Through garibi hatao Indira Gandhi tried to 
generate a support base among the disadvantaged, especially among 
the landless labourers, Dalits and Adivasis, minorities, women and 
the unemployed youth. The slogan of garibi hatao and the programmes 
that followed it were part of Indira Gandhi’s political strategy of 
building an independent nationwide political support base.

The outcome and after

The results of the Lok Sabha elections of 1971, were as dramatic 
as was the decision to hold these elections.  The Congress(R)-CPI 
alliance won more seats and votes than the Congress had ever won 
in the first four general elections. The combine won 375 seats in Lok 
Sabha and secured 48.4 per cent votes. Indira Gandhi’s Congress(R) 
won 352 seats with about 44 per cent of the popular votes on its own. 
Contrast this with the performance of the Congress(O): the party 
with so many stalwarts could get less than one-fourth of the votes 
secured by Indira Gandhi’s party and win merely 16 seats. With this 
the Congress party led by Indira Gandhi established its claim to being 
the ‘real’ Congress and restored to it the dominant position in Indian 
politics. The Grand Alliance of the opposition proved a grand failure. 
Their combined tally of seats was less than 60.

Soon after the 1971 Lok Sabha elections, 
a major political and military crisis broke 
out in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). As 
you have read in Chapter Four, the 1971 
elections were followed by the crisis in East 
Pakistan and the Indo-Pak war leading to the 
establishment of Bangladesh. These events 
added to the popularity of Indira Gandhi. 
Even the opposition leaders admired her 
statesmanship. Her party swept through all

the States.  It was also popular across different social sections. Within 
a span of four years, Indira Gandhi had warded off the challenge to 
her leadership and to the dominant position of the Congress  party.

We have seen in the last chapter that the Congress recovered after 
1971, but was not the same kind of party. The difference became 
clear in a series of events between 1973 and 1975 that brought new 
challenges to India’s democratic politics and the institutional balance 
sought by the Constitution. These developments led to the imposition of 
‘emergency’ in June 1975. Normally, we would associate ‘emergency’ 
with war and aggression or with natural disaster. But this ‘emergency’ 
was imposed because of the perceived threat of internal disturbance.

the crisis of 
Democratic orDer
Background to Emergency
We have already studied the changes that were taking place in Indian 
politics since 1967. Indira Gandhi had emerged as a towering leader 
with tremendous popularity. This was also the period when party 
competition became bitter and polarised. This period also witnessed 
tensions in the relationship between the government and the judiciary. 
The Supreme Court found many initiatives of the government to be 
violative of the Constitution. The Congress party took the position 
that this stand of the Court was against principles of democracy 
and parliamentary supremacy. The Congress also alleged that the 
Court was a conservative institution and it was becoming an obstacle 
in the way of implementing pro-poor welfare programmes. The 
parties opposed to the Congress felt that politics was becoming too 
personalised and that governmental authority was being converted 
into personal authority. The split in the Congress had sharpened the 
divisions between Indira Gandhi and her opponents. 

Economic context PM says

In the elections of 1971, Congress had given the slogan 
of garibi hatao (remove poverty). However, the social and 
economic condition in the country did not improve much 
after 1971-72. The Bangladesh crisis had put a heavy strain 
on India’s economy. About eight million people crossed 
over the East Pakistan border into India. This was followed 
by war with Pakistan.  After the war the U.S government 
stopped all aid to India. In the international market, oil 
prices increased manifold during this period.  This led to 
an all-round increase in prices of commodities.  Prices 
increased by 23 per cent in 1973 and 30 per cent in 1974. 
Such a high level of inflation caused much hardship to 
the people. 

Industrial growth was low and unemployment was 
very high, particularly in the rural areas.  In order to 
reduce expenditure the government froze the salaries 
of its employees.  This caused further dissatisfaction 
among government employees. Monsoons failed in 1972-
1973. This resulted in a sharp decline in agricultural 
productivity.  Food grain output declined by 8 per cent.

There was a general atmosphere of dissatisfaction with the prevailing 
economic situation all over the country. In such a context non-
Congress opposition parties were able to organise popular protests 
effectively.  Instances of students’ unrests that had persisted from 
the late 1960s became more pronounced in this period. There was 
also an increase in the activities of Marxist groups who did not 
believe in parliamentary politics.  These groups had taken to arms

Gujarat and Bihar movements

Students’ protests in Gujarat and Bihar, both of which were Congress 
ruled States, had far reaching impact on the politics of the two States 
and national politics.  In January 1974 students in Gujarat started 
an agitation against rising prices of food grains, cooking oil and 
other essential commodities, and against corruption in high places. 
The students’ protest was joined by major opposition parties and 
became widespread leading to the imposition of President’s rule in the 
state.  The opposition parties demanded fresh elections to the state 
legislature. Morarji Desai, a prominent leader of Congress (O), who 
was the main rival of Indira Gandhi when he was in the Congress, 
announced that he would go on an indefinite fast if fresh elections

parties were projecting JP as an alternative to Indira Gandhi. However, 
there were many criticisms about his ideas and about the politics of 
mass agitations that he was employing. Both the Gujarat and Bihar 
agitations were seen as anti-Congress and rather than opposing the 
State governments, they were seen as protests against the leadership 
of Indira Gandhi. She believed that the movement was motivated by 
personal opposition to her.

Railway Strike of 1974

What	 would	 happen	 when	 the	 railways	 stop	 running?	 Not	 for	 one	 or	
two	days,	but	for	more	than	a	week?	Of	course,	many	people	would	be	
inconvenienced; but more than that, the economy of the country would 
come to a halt because goods are transported from one part to another 
by trains. 

Do	you	know	that	such	a	thing	actually	happened	in	1974?	The	National	
Coordination Committee for Railwaymen’s Struggle led by George 
Fernandes gave a call for nationwide strike by all employees of the 
Railways for pressing their demands related to bonus and service 
conditions. The government was opposed to these demands. So, the 
employees of India’s largest public sector undertaking went on a strike in 
May 1974. The strike by the Railway employees added to the atmosphere 
of labour unrest. It also raised issues like rights of the workers and whether 
employees of essential services should adopt measures like strikes. 

The government declared the strike illegal. As the government refused 
to concede the demands of the striking workers, arrested many of their 
leaders and deployed the territorial army to protect railway tracks, the 
strike had to be called off after twenty days without any settlement.  

Conflict with Judiciary

This was also the period when the government and the ruling party 
had many differences with the judiciary. Do you remember the 
discussion about the long drawn conflict between the Parliament and 
the judiciary? You have studied this last year.  Three constitutional 
issues had emerged. Can the Parliament abridge Fundamental Rights?

that this crisis culminated in the famous Kesavananda Bharati Case. In 
this case, the Court gave a decision that there are some basic features 
of the Constitution and the Parliament cannot amend these features. 

Two developments further added to the tension between the 
judiciary and the executive. Immediately after the Supreme Court’s 
decision in 1973 in the Keshavananda Bharati case, a vacancy arose 
for the post of the Chief Justice of India. It had been a practice to 
appoint the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief 
Justice. But in 1973, the government set aside the seniority of 
three judges and appointed Justice A. N. Ray as the Chief Justice 
of India. The appointment became politically controversial because 
all the three judges who were superseded had given rulings against 
the stand of the government. Thus, constitutional interpretations 
and political ideologies were getting mixed up rapidly. People 
close to the Prime Minister started talking of the need for a 
judiciary and the bureaucracy ‘committed’ to the vision of the 
executive and the legislature. The climax of the confrontation was 
of course the ruling of the High Court declaring Indira Gandhi’s 
election invalid.

D laration  Emergency
On 12 June 1975, Justice Jagmohan Lal Sinha of the Allahabad High 
Court passed a judgment declaring Indira Gandhi’s election to the 
Lok Sabha invalid. This order came on an election petition filed by 
Raj Narain, a socialist leader and a candidate who had contested 
against her in 1971. The petition, challenged the election of Indira 
Gandhi on the ground that she had used the services of government 
servants in her election campaign. The judgment of the High Court 
meant that legally she was no more an MP and therefore, could not 
remain the Prime Minister unless she was once again elected as an 
MP within six months. On June 24, the Supreme Court granted her a 
partial stay on the High Court order – till her appeal was decided, she 
could remain an MP but could not take part in the proceedings of the 
Lok Sabha.

political parties led by Jayaprakash Narayan pressed for Indira

Delhi’s Ramlila grounds on 25 June 1975. Jayaprakash announced 
a nationwide satyagraha for her resignation and asked the army, the 
police and government employees not to obey “illegal and immoral 
orders”.  This too threatened to bring the activities of the government 
to a standstill. The political mood of the country had turned against 
the Congress, more than ever before.

The response of the government was to declare a state of emergency. 
On 25 June 1975, the government declared that there was a threat 
of internal disturbances and therefore, it invoked Article 352 of the 
Constitution. Under the provision of this article the government could 
declare a state of emergency on grounds of external threat or a threat 
of internal disturbances. The government decided that a grave crisis 
had arisen which made the proclamation of a state of emergency 
necessary. Technically speaking this was within the powers of the 
government, for our Constitution provides for some special powers to 
the government once an emergency is declared. 

Once an emergency is proclaimed, the federal distribution of powers 
remains practically suspended and all the powers are concentrated in 
the hands of the union government. Secondly, the government also 
gets the power to curtail or restrict all or any of the Fundamental 
Rights during the emergency. From the wording of the provisions 
of the Constitution, it is clear that an Emergency is seen as an

extraordinary condition in which normal democratic politics cannot 
function. Therefore, special powers are granted to the government. 

On the night of 25 June 1975, the Prime Minister recommended 
the imposition of Emergency to President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. He 
issued the proclamation immediately. After midnight, the electricity 
to all the major newspaper offices was disconnected. In the early 
morning, a large number of leaders and workers of the opposition 
parties were arrested. The Cabinet was informed about it at a special 
meeting at 6 a.m. on 26 June, after all this had taken place.

Emergency provisions, the government suspended the freedom of the recommendation from

Press. Newspapers were asked to get prior approval for all material 
to be published. This is known as press censorship. Apprehending 
social and communal disharmony, the government banned Rashtriya 
Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Jamait-e-Islami. Protests and strikes 
and public agitations were also disallowed.  Most importantly, under 
the provisions of Emergency, the various Fundamental Rights of 
citizens stood suspended, including the right of citizens to move the 
Court for restoring their Fundamental Rights.

could not challenge their arrest through habeas corpus petitions. 
Many cases were filed in the High Courts and the Supreme Court by 
and on behalf of arrested persons, but the government claimed that it 
was not even necessary to inform the arrested persons of the reasons 
and grounds of their arrest. Several High Courts gave judgments that 
even after the declaration of Emergency the courts could entertain a 
writ of habeas corpus filed by a person challenging his/her detention. 
In April 1976, the constitution bench of the Supreme Court over-ruled 
the High Courts and accepted the government’s plea. It meant that 
during Emergency the government could take away the citizen’s right 
to life and liberty. This judgment closed the doors of judiciary for the 
citizens and is regarded as one of the most controversial judgments 
of the Supreme Court.

There were many acts of dissent and resistance to the Emergency. 
Many political workers who were not arrested in the first wave, 
went ‘underground’ and organised protests against the government. 
Newspapers like the Indian Express and the Statesman protested 
against censorship by leaving blank spaces where news items had

chose to close down rather than submit to censorship. Many 
journalists were arrested for writing against the Emergency. Many 
underground newsletters and leaflets were published to bypass 
censorship. Kannada writer Shivarama Karanth, awarded with 
Padma Bhushan, and Hindi writer Fanishwarnath Renu, awarded

judiciary to protect civil liberties effectively during the emergency. 
Many civil liberties organisations came up after this experience.

However, the critical years of emergency brought many issues 
that have not been adequately grappled with. We have noted in 
this chapter that there is a tension between routine functioning of 
a democratic government and the continuous political protests by 
parties and groups. What is the correct balance between the two? 
Should the citizens have full freedom to engage in protest activity or 
should they have no such right at all? What are the limits to such a 
protest?

Secondly, the actual implementation of the Emergency rule took 
place through the police and the administration. These institutions 
could not function independently. They were turned into political 
instruments of the ruling party and according to the Shah Commission 
Report, the administration and the police became vulnerable to 
political pressures. This problem did not vanish after the Emergency. 

Politics aer Emergency
The most valuable and lasting lesson of the Emergency was learnt 
as soon as the Emergency was over and the Lok Sabha 
elections were announced. The 1977 elections turned 
into a referendum on the experience of the Emergency, at 
least in north India where the impact of the Emergency 
was felt most strongly. The opposition fought the election 
on the slogan of ‘save democracy’. The people’s verdict 
was decisively against the Emergency. The lesson 
was clear and has been reiterated in many state level 
elections thereafter– governments that are perceived to be 
anti-democratic are severely punished by the voters. In this 
sense the experience of 1975–77 ended up strengthening Morarji Desai

Some other Congress leaders also came out and formed a separate party 
under the leadership of Jagjivan Ram. This party named as Congress 
for Democracy, later merged with the Janata Party. 

The Janata Party made this election into a referendum on the 
Emergency. Its campaign was focused on the non-democratic character 
of the rule and on the various excesses that took place during this 
period. In the backdrop of arrests of thousands of persons and the 
censorship of the Press, the public opinion was against the Congress. 
Jayaprakash Narayan became the popular symbol of restoration of 
democracy. The formation of the Janata Party also ensured that non-
Congress votes would not be divided. It was evident that the going was 
tough for the Congress.

Yet the final results took everyone by surprise. For the first time 
since Independence, the Congress party was defeated in the Lok Sabha 
elections.  The Congress could win only 154 seats in the Lok Sabha. 
Its share of popular votes fell to less than 35 per cent.  The Janata 
Party and its allies won 330 out of the 542 seats in the Lok Sabha; 
Janata Party itself won 295 seats and thus enjoyed a clear majority. 
In north India, it was a massive electoral wave against the Congress. 
The Congress lost in every constituency in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, 
Haryana and the Punjab and could win only one seat each in Rajasthan 
and Madhya Pradesh. Indira Gandhi was defeated from Rae Bareli, as 
was her son Sanjay Gandhi from Amethi.

But if you look at the map showing the result of this election, you 
will notice that Congress did not lose elections all over the country. 
It retained many seats in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Orissa and 
virtually swept through the southern States. There are many reasons 
for this. To begin with, the impact of Emergency was not felt equally 
in all the States. The forced relocation and displacements, the forced 
sterilisations, were mostly concentrated in the northern States. 
But more importantly, north India had experienced some long term 
changes in the nature of political competition. The middle castes from 
north India were beginning to move away from the Congress and the 
Janata party became a platform for many of these sections to come 
together. In this sense, the elections of 1977 were not merely about 
the Emergency.  

Janata Government

The Janata Party government that came to power after the 1977 elections 
was far from cohesive. After the election, there was stiff competition 
among three leaders for the post of Prime Minister – Morarji Desai, who 
was the rival to Indira Gandhi ever since 1966-67; Charan Singh, leader 
of the Bharatiya Lok Dal and a farmers’ leader from UP; and Jagjivan 
Ram, who had vast experience as a senior minister in the Congress 
governments. Eventually Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister but 
that did not bring the power struggle within the party to an end.

The opposition to emergency could keep the Janata Party together 
only for a while. Its critics felt that the Janata Party  lacked direction, 
leadership, and a common programme. The Janata Party government 
could not bring about a fundamental change in policies from those 
pursued by the Congress. The Janata Party split and the government 
which was led by Morarji Desai lost its majority in less than 28 
months.  Another government headed by Charan Singh was formed on 
the assurance of the support of the Congress party.  But the Congress 
party later decided to withdraw its support with the result that the 
Charan Singh government could remain in power for just about 4 
months.  Fresh Lok Sabha elections were held in January 1980 in 
which the Janata Party suffered a comprehensive defeat, especially 
in north India where it had swept the polls in 1977.  Congress 
party led by Indira Gandhi nearly repeated its great victory in 1971. 
It won 353 seats and came back to power. The experience of 

1977–79 taught another lesson in democratic politics: 
governments that are seen to be unstable and quarrelsome are 
severely punished by the voters. 

Legacy

But was it only a case of return of Indira Gandhi? Between 
the elections of 1977 and 1980 the party system had changed 
dramatically.  Since 1969, the Congress party had starting 
shedding its character as an umbrella party which accommodated 
leaders and workers of different ideological dispensations and

In the first chapter of this book we studied the 
process of ‘nation-building’ in the first decade 
after Independence. But nation-building is 
not something that can be accomplished 
once and for all times to come. In the course 
of time new challenges came up. Some of the 
old problems had never been fully resolved. 
As democratic experiment unfolded, people 
from different regions began to express 
their aspirations for autonomy. Sometimes 
these aspirations were expressed outside 
the framework of the Indian union. These 
involved long struggles and often aggressive 
and armed assertions by the people. 
This new challenge came to the fore in the 
1980s, as the Janata experiment came to an 
end and there was some political stability at 
the centre. This decade will be remembered 
for some major conflicts and accords in the

regional 
aspirations

Region and the Nation
1980s may be seen as a period of rising regional aspirations for 
autonomy, often outside the framework of the Indian Union.  These 
movements frequently involved armed assertions by the people, 
their repression by the government, and a collapse of the political 
and electoral processes.  It is also not surprising that most of these 
struggles were long drawn and concluded in negotiated settlements 
or accords between the central government and the groups leading 
the movement for autonomy. The accords were reached after a 
process of dialogue that aimed to settle contentious issues within the 
constitutional framework.  Yet the journey to the accord was always 
tumultuous and often violent. 

Indian approach

In studying the Indian Constitution and the process of nation-building 
we have repeatedly come across one basic principle of the Indian 
approach to diversity  the Indian nation shall not deny the rights of 
different regions and linguistic groups to retain their own culture. We 
decided to live a united social life without losing the distinctiveness 
of the numerous cultures that constituted it.  Indian nationalism 
sought to balance the principles of unity and diversity. The nation 
would not mean the negation of the region. In this sense the Indian

Democracy allows the political expressions of regional aspirations all?
and does not look upon them as anti-national. 
Besides, democratic politics allows parties and groups 
to address the people on the basis of their regional 
identity, aspiration and specific regional problems. 
Thus, in the course of democratic politics, regional 
aspirations get strengthened. At the same time, 
democratic politics also means that regional issues 
and problems will receive adequate attention and 
accommodation in the policy making process.  

Such an arrangement may sometimes lead to 
tensions and problems. Sometimes, the concern for 
national unity may overshadow the regional needs

and aspirations.  At other times a concern for region alone may 
blind us to the larger needs of the nation. Therefore, political 
conflicts over issues of power of the regions, their rights and 
their separate existence are common to nations that want to 
respect diversity while trying to forge and retain unity. 

Areas of tension

In the first chapter you have seen how immediately after 
Independence our nation had to cope with many difficult issues 
like Partition, displacement, integration of Princely States, 
reorganisation of states and so on. Many observers, both within 
the country and from outside, had predicted that India as one 
unified country cannot last long. Soon after Independence, 
the issue of Jammu and Kashmir came up. It was not only a 
conflict between India and Pakistan. More than that, it was a 
question of the political aspirations of the people of Kashmir 
valley. Similarly, in some parts of the north-east, there was no 
consensus about being a part of India. First Nagaland and then 
Mizoram witnessed strong movements demanding separation 
from India. In the south, some groups from the Dravid movement 
briefly toyed with the idea of a separate country. 

These events were followed by mass agitations in many parts 
for the formation of linguistic States. Todays Andhra Pradesh, 
Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Gujarat were among the regions 
affected by these agitations. In some parts of southern India, 
particularly Tamil Nadu, there were protests against making 
Hindi the official national language of the country. In the 
north, there were strong pro-Hindi agitations demanding that 

Why does the 
Hindi be made the official language immediately. From the late

States? for a separate State for themselves. This demand was finally 
accepted and the States of Punjab and Haryana were created 
in 1966. Later, the States of Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and 
Jharkhand were created. Thus the challenge of diversity was 
met by redrawing the internal boundaries of the country.

Yet this did not lead to resolution of all problems and for 
all times. In some regions, like Kashmir and Nagaland, the 
challenge was so complex that it could not be resolved in the 
first phase of nation-building. Besides, new challenges came 
up in States like Punjab, Assam and Mizoram. Let us study 
these cases in some detail. In this process let us also go back 
to some of the earlier instances of difficulties of nation building. 
The successes and failures in these cases are instructive not 
merely for a study of our past, but also for an understanding 
of Indias future.

Jammu and Kashmir Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh

As you have studied in the 
previous year, Jammu and 
Kashmir had a special status 
under Article 370 of the Indian 
Constitution. However, in spite 
of it, Jammu and Kashmir 
experienced violence, cross 
border terrorism and political 
instability with internal 
and external ramifications. 
It also resulted in the loss of 
many lives including that of 
innocent civilians, security 
personnel and militants. 
Besides, there was also a 
large scale displacement of 
Kashmiri Pandits from the 
Kashmir valley.

Kashmir and Ladakh. The Jammu region is a mix of foothills and 
plains. It is predominantly inhabited by the Hindus.  Muslims, Sikhs 
and people of other denominations also reside in this region. The 
Kashmir region mainly comprises of the Kashmir valley. It is inhabited 
mostly by Kashmiri Muslims with the remaining being Hindus, Sikhs, 
Buddhists and others. The Ladakh region is mainly mountainous. 
It has very little population which is almost equally divided between 
Buddhists and Muslims.

Roots of the Problem

Before 1947, Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) was a Princely State. Its 
ruler, Maharaja Hari Singh did not want to merge either with India 
or Pakistan but to have an independent status for his state. The 
Pakistani leaders thought that Kashmir region belonged to Pakistan, 
since the majority population of the State was Muslim. But this is 
not how the people of the state themselves saw it they thought of 
themselves as Kashmiris above all. This issue of regional aspiration 
is known as Kashmiriyat. The popular movement in the State, led 
by Sheikh Abdullah of the National Conference, wanted to get rid 
of the Maharaja, but was against joining Pakistan. The National 
Conference was a secular organisation and had a long association 
with the Congress. Sheikh Abdullah was a personal friend of some of 
the leading nationalist leaders including Nehru.

DMK’s popularity.
Sustained political agitations brought the DMK to power in the Assembly 
elections of 1967. Since then, the Dravidian parties have dominated 
the politics of Tamil Nadu. Though  the DMK split after the death of 
its leader, C. Annadurai,  the influence of Dravidian parties in Tamil 
politics actually increased. After the split there were two parties – the 
DMK and the All India Anna DMK (AIADMK) – that claimed Dravidian 
legacy. Both these parties have dominated politics in Tamil Nadu for 
the last four decades. Since 1996, one of these parties has been a part 
of the ruling coalition at the Centre. In the 1990s, many other parties 
have emerged. These include Marumalarchchi Dravida Munnetra 
Kazhagam (MDMK), Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and Desiya Murpokku 
Dravidar Kazhagam (DMDK). All these parties have kept alive the issue 
of regional pride in the politics of Tamil Nadu. Initially seen as a threat 
to Indian nationalism, regional politics in Tamil Nadu is a good example 
of the compatibility of regionalism and nationalism.

External and internal disputes

Since then the politics of Jammu and Roja
Kashmir remained controversial and 
conflict-ridden both for external and 
internal reasons. Externally, Pakistan has 
always claimed that Kashmir valley should 
be part of Pakistan. As we noted above, 
Pakistan sponsored a tribal invasion of

Pakistani control. However, it is the Indian

Politics since 1948

After taking over as the Prime Minister, Sheikh Abdullah initiated 
major land reforms and other policies which benefitted ordinary 
people. But there was a growing difference between him and the 
central government about his position on Kashmir’s status. He was 
dismissed in 1953 and kept in detention for a number of years. 
The leadership that succeeded him did not enjoy as much popular 
support and was able to rule the State mainly due to the support of 
the Centre. There were serious allegations of malpractices and rigging 
in various elections.

During most of the period between 1953 and 1974, the Congress 
party exercised influence on the politics of the State. A truncated 
National Conference (minus Sheikh Abdullah) remained in power 
with the active support of Congress for some time but later it merged 
with the Congress. Thus, the Congress gained direct control over 
the government in the state and brought about the changes. In 
the meanwhile, there were several attempts to reach an agreement 
between Sheikh Abdullah and the Government of India. A change in 
the provision of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir was made in 
1965 by which the Prime Minister of the state was designated as Chief 
Minister of the state. Accordingly, Ghulam Mohammed Sadiq of the 
Indian National Congress became the first Chief Minister of the state.

In 1974 Indira Gandhi reached an agreement with Sheikh Abdullah 
and he became the Chief Minister of the State. He revived the National 
Conference which was elected with majority in the assembly elections 
held in 1977. Sheikh Abdullah died in 1982 and the leadership of the 
National Conference went to his son, Farooq Abdullah, who became 
the Chief Minister. But he soon was dismissed by the Governor and 
a breakaway faction of the National Conference came to power for a 
brief period.

The dismissal of Farooq Abdullahs government due to the 
intervention of the Centre generated a feeling of resentment in 
Kashmir. The confidence that Kashmiris had developed in the 
democratic processes after the accord between Indira Gandhi and 
Sheikh Abdullah, received a setback. The feeling that the Centre was 
intervening in politics of the State was further strengthened when the 
National Conference in 1986 agreed to have an electoral alliance with 
the Congress, the ruling party in the Centre.

Insurgency and After

It was in this environment that the 1987 Assembly election took 
place. The official results showed a massive victory of the National 
Conference Congress alliance and Farooq Abdullah returned as 
Chief Minister. But it was widely believed that the results did not 
reflect popular choice, and that the entire election process was 
rigged. A popular resentment had already been brewing in the State 
against the inefficient administration since early 1980s. This was 
now augmented by the commonly prevailing feeling that democratic 
processes were being undermined by the state at the behest of the 
Centre. This generated a political crisis in Kashmir which became 
severe with the rise of insurgency.

By 1989, the State had come in the grip of a militant movement 
mobilised around the cause of a separate Kashmiri nation. The 
insurgents got moral, material and military support from Pakistan. For 
a number of years the State was under Presidents rule and effectively 
under the control of the armed forces. Throughout the period from 
1990, Jammu and Kashmir experienced extraordinary violence at the 
hands of the insurgents and through army action. Assembly elections 
in the State were held only in 1996 in which the National Conference 
led by Farooq Abdullah came to power with a demand for regional 
autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir. At the end of its term, elections 
were held in the State in 2002. The National Conference failed to win 
a majority and was replaced by a coalition government of Peoples 
Democratic Party (PDP) and Congress.

It was in this context that during the 1970s a section of Akalis

e North-East
In the North-East, regional aspirations reached a turning point in 
1980s. This region now consists of eight States. Arunachal Pradesh, 
Assam, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram and Meghalaya, which 
earlier constituted the North-East region, are often called “the seven 
sisters”. Sikkim, which has been added to the list is – referred to as the 
‘Brother’ to those seven states. The region has only 4 per cent of the 
country’s population but about twice as much share of its area. A small 
corridor of about 22 kilometers connects the region to the rest of the 
country. Otherwise the region shares boundaries with China, Myanmar 
and Bangladesh and serves as India’s gateway to South East Asia. 

The region has witnessed a lot of change since 1947. Tripura, 
Manipur and Khasi Hills of Meghalaya were erstwhile Princely States 
which merged with India after Independence. The entire region of 
North-East has undergone considerable political reorganisation. 
Nagaland State was created in 1963; Manipur, Tripura and Meghalaya 
in 1972 while Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh became separate 
States only in 1987. The Partition of India in 1947 had reduced the

The isolation of the region, its complex social character and its 
backwardness compared to other parts of the country have all  resulted 

in the complicated set of demands from 
different states of the North-East. The 
vast international border and weak 
communication between the North-East 
and the rest of India have further added 
to the delicate nature of politics there. 
Three issues dominate the politics of 
North-East: demands for autonomy, 
movements for secession, and  opposition 
to  ‘outsiders’. Major initiatives on the 
first issue in the 1970s set the stage 
for some dramatic developments on the 
second and the third in the 1980s. 

Demands for autonomy

At independence the entire region except 
Manipur and Tripura comprised the 
State of Assam. Demands for political 
autonomy arose when the non-Assamese 
felt that the Assam government was 
imposing Assamese language on them.

were upgraded into States too.  

The reorganisation of the North-East was completed by 1972. But 
this was not the end of autonomy demands in this region. In Assam, 
for example, communities like the Bodos, Karbis and Dimasas wanted 
separate States. They worked for this demand by mobilising public 
opinion and popular movement as well as through insurgency. Often 
the same area was claimed by more than one community. It was not 
possible to go on making smaller and yet smaller States. Therefore, 
some other provisions of our federal set up were used to satisfy their 
autonomy demands while remaining in Assam. Karbis and Dimasas 
have been granted autonomy under District Councils while Bodos 
were recently granted Autonomous Council. 

Secessionist movements

Demands for autonomy were easier to respond to, for these involved 
using the various provisions in the Constitution for accommodation of 
diversities. It was much more difficult when some groups demanded 
a separate country, not in momentary anger but consistently as a Laldenga

Movements against outsiders

The large scale migration into the North-East gave rise to a special 
kind of problem that pitted the local communities against people 
who were seen as outsiders or migrants.  These latecomers, either 
from India or abroad are seen as encroachers on scarce resources Angami Zapu

Sikkim’s merger 

At the time of Independence, Sikkim was a ‘protectorate’ of 
India. It meant that while it was not a part of India, it was also 
not a fully sovereign country. Sikkim’s defence and foreign 
relations were looked after by India, while the power of internal 
administration was with the Chogyal, Sikkim’s monarch. This 
arrangement ran into difficulty as the Chogyal was unable to deal 
with the democratic aspirations of the people. An overwhelming Kazi Lhendup Dorji 
majority of Sikkim’s population was Nepali. But the Chogyal was Khangsarpa (1904):

supporters accused the Government of India of foul play and 
use of force. Yet the merger enjoyed popular support and did not 
become a divisive issue in Sikkim’s politics.

Accommodation and National Integration
These  cases  have shown us that even after 75 years of independence, 
some of the issues of national integration are not fully resolved. We 
have seen that regional aspirations ranging from demands of statehood 
and economic development to autonomy and separation keep coming 
up. The period since 1980 accentuated these tensions and tested the 
capacity of democratic politics to accommodate the demands of diverse 
sections of the society.  What lessons can we draw from these examples? 

First and the most elementary lesson is that regional aspirations 
are very much a part of democratic politics. Expression of regional 
issues is not an aberration or an abnormal phenomenon. Even 
in smaller countries like the United Kingdom there are regional 
aspirations in Scotland, Wales and Northern ireland. Spain faces 
secessionist movement from the Basques and so does Sri Lanka from 
the Tamils. A large and diverse democracy like india must deal with 
regional aspirations on a regular basis. Nation building is an ongoing 
process.

The second lesson is that the best way to respond to regional 
aspirations is through democratic negotiations rather than through 
suppression. Look at the situation in the eighties – militancy had 
erupted in Punjab; problems were persisting in the North-East; 
students in Assam were agitating; Kashmir valley was on the 
boil. Instead of treating these as simple law and order problems, 
the Government of India reached negotiated settlement with 
regional movements. This produced a reconciliation which 
reduced the tensions existing in many regions. The example of 
Mizoram shows how political settlement can resolve the problem 
of separatism effectively.

Schedule of the Constitution allows different tribes complete 
autonomy of preserving their practices and customary laws. 
These provisions proved crucial in resolving some very complex 
political problems in the North-East.

What distinguishes India from many other countries that face 
similar challenges is that the constitutional framework in India 
is much more flexible and accommodative. Therefore, regional 
aspirations are not encouraged to espouse separatism. Thus, 
politics in India has succeeded in accepting regionalism as part 
and parcel of democratic politics.

Goa’s liberation
Although the British empire in India came to an end in 1947, Portugal refused to withdraw from 
the territories of Goa, Diu and Daman which were under its colonial rule since the sixteenth 
century. During their long rule, the Portuguese suppressed the people of Goa, denied them 
civil rights, and carried out forced religious conversions. After India’s Independence, the Indian 
government tried very patiently to persuade the Portuguese government to withdraw. There 
was also a strong popular movement within Goa for freedom. They were strengthened by 
socialist satyagrahis from Maharashtra.  Finally, in December 1961, the Government of India 
sent the army which liberated these territories after barely two days of action. Goa, Diu and 
Daman became Union Territory. 
Another complication arose soon. Led by the Maharashtrawadi Gomanatak Party  (MGP) 
one section desired that Goa, as a Marathi speaking area should merge with Maharashtra. 
However, many Goans were keen to retain a separate Goan identity and culture, particularly 
the Konkani language. They were led by the United Goan Party (UGP). In January 1967, 
the Central Government held a special ‘opinion poll’ in Goa asking people to decide if they 
wanted to be part of Maharashtra or remain separate. A referendum-like procedure was used 
to ascertain people’s wishes on this issue. The majority voted in favour of remaining outside 
of Maharashtra. Thus, Goa continued as a Union Territory.  Finally, in 1987, Goa became a 
State of the Indian Union.

In this last chapter we take a synoptic view of the last two decades of 
politics in India. These developments are complex, for various kinds of 
factors came together to produce unanticipated outcomes in this period. 
The new era in politics was impossible to foresee; it is still very difficult to 
understand. These developments are also controversial, for these involve 
deep conflicts and we are still too close to the events. Yet we can ask 
some questions central to the political change in this period.

chapter 8
recent Developments 
in inDian politics
Cont  the 1990s
You have read in the last chapter that Rajiv Gandhi became the Prime 
Minister after the assassination of Indira Gandhi. He led the Congress 
to a massive victory in the Lok Sabha elections held immediately 
thereafter in 1984. As the decade of the eighties came to a close, the 
country witnessed five developments that were to make a long-lasting 
impact on our politics. 

irst the most crucial development of this period was the defeat 

Fof the Congress party in the elections held in 1989. The party 
that had won as many as 415 seats in the Lok Sabha in 1984 

was reduced to only 197 in this election. The Congress improved 
its performance and came back to power soon after the mid-term 
elections held in 1991. But the elections of 1989 marked the end of 
what political scientists have called the ‘Congress system’. To be sure, 
the Congress remained an important party and ruled the country 
more than any other party even in this period since 1989. But it lost 
the kind of centrality it earlier enjoyed in the party system.

I wish to find 
out if the Congress 

can still bounce back 
to its old glory. 

Congress leader Sitaram Kesri withdrew the crutches of support from Deve 
Gowda’s United Front Government. 

econd development was the rise of the ‘Mandal issue’ in national 

Spolitics. This followed the decision by the new National Front 
government in 1990, to implement the recommendation of 

the Mandal Commission that jobs in central government should be 
reserved for the Other Backward Classes. This led to violent ‘anti-
Mandal’ protests in different parts of the country. This dispute between 
the supporters and opponents of OBC reservations was known as the 
‘Mandal issue’ and was to play an important role in shaping politics 
since 1989.

ourth, the centuries old legal and political dispute over the 

FRam Janmabhoomi Temple in Ayodhya started influencing the 
politics of India which gave birth to various political changes. 

The Ram Janmabhoomi Temple Movement, becoming the central 
issue, transformed the direction of the discourse on secularism and 
democracy. These changes culminated in the construction of the Ram 
Temple at Ayodhya following the decision of the constitutional bench 
of the Supreme Court (which was announced on November 9, 2019).

Era  Coalitions
Elections in 1989 led to the defeat of the Congress party but did not 
result in a majority for any other party. Though the Congress was the 
largest party in the Lok Sabha, it did not have a clear majority and 
therefore, it decided to sit in the opposition. The National Front (which 
itself was an alliance of Janata Dal and some other regional parties) 
received support from two diametrically opposite political groups: the 
BJP and the Left Front. On this basis, the National Front formed a 
coalition government, but the BJP and the Left Front did not join in 
this government.

Decline of Congress

The defeat of the Congress party marked the end of Congress dominance 
over the Indian party system. Do you remember the discussion in 
Chapters about the restoration of the Congress system? Way back in 
the late sixties, the dominance of the Congress party was challenged; 
but the Congress under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, managed to 
re-establish its predominant position in politics. The nineties saw yet 
another challenge to the predominant position of the Congress. It did 
not, however, mean the emergence of any other single party to fill in 
its place.

Thus, began an era of multi-party system. To be sure, a large 
number of political parties always contested elections in our country. 
Our Parliament always had representatives from several political 
parties. What happened after 1989 was the emergence of several 
parties in such a way that one or two parties did not get most of 
the votes or seats. This also meant that no single party secured a 
clear majority of seats in any Lok Sabha election held since 1989 till 
2014. This development initiated an era of coalition governments at 
the Centre, in which regional parties played a crucial role in forming 
ruling alliances but in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha election, the BJP 
got clear majority on its own. 

Talk to your parents about their memories of the events happening 
since the 1990s. Ask them what they felt were the most significant 
events of the period.  Sit together in groups and draw a comprehensive 
list of the events reported by your parents, see which events get cited 
most, and compare them with what the chapter suggests were the 
most significant. You can also discuss why some events are more 
important for some and not for others.  

Alliance politics

The nineties also saw the emergence of powerful parties and movements 
that represented the Dalit and backward castes (Other Backward 
Classes or OBCs). Many of these parties represented powerful 
regional assertion as well. These parties played an important role in 
the United Front government that came to power in 1996. The United 
Front was similar to the National Front of 1989 for it included Janata 
Dal and several regional parties. This time the BJP did not support 
the government. The United Front government was supported by 
the Congress. This shows how unstable the political equations were. 
In 1989, both the Left and the BJP supported the National Front 
Government because they wanted to keep the Congress out of power. 
In 1996, the Left continued to support the non-Congress government 
but this time the Congress, supported it, as both the Congress and 
the Left wanted to keep the BJP out of power. 

They did not succeed for long, as the BJP continued to 
consolidate its position in the elections of 1991 and 1996. It 
emerged as the largest party in the 1996 election and was invited 
to form the government. But most other parties were opposed to 
its policies and therefore, the BJP government could not secure 
a majority in the Lok Sabha. It finally came to power by leading

a coalition government from May 1998 to June 1999 and was 
re-elected in October 1999. Atal Behari Vajpayee was the Prime 
Minister during both these NDA governments and his government 
formed in 1999 completed its full term. 

A cartoonist’s depiction of the change from one-party dominance to a multi-party 
alliance system.

Thus, with the elections of 1989, a long phase of coalition politics 
began in India.  Since then, there have been eleven governments at 
the Centre, all of which have either been coalition governments or 
minority governments supported by other parties, which did not join 
the government. In this new phase, any government could be formed 
only with the participation or support of many regional parties. This 
applied to the National Front in 1989, the United Front in 1996 and 
1997, the BJP-led coalition in 1998, the NDA in 1999, the UPA in 
2004 and 2009.  However, this trend changed in 2014.

Let us connect this development with what we have learnt so far. 
The era of coalition governments may be seen as a long-term trend 
resulting from relatively silent changes that were taking place over 
the last few decades.  

We saw in Chapter Two that in earlier times, it was the Congress 
party itself that was a ‘coalition’ of different interests and different social 
strata and groups.  This gave rise to the term ‘Congress system’.

We also saw in Chapters that, especially since the late 1960s, 
various sections had been leaving the Congress fold and forming 
separate political parties of their own. We also noted the rise of many 
regional parties in the period after 1977.  While these developments 
weakened the Congress party, they did not enable any single party to 
replace the Congress.

Political Rise  Other Backward Cl
One long-term development of this period was the rise of Other 
Backward Classes as a political force. You have already come across 
this term ‘OBC’. This refers to the administrative category ‘Other 
Backward Classes’. These are communities other than SC and ST 
who suffer from educational and social backwardness. These are also 
referred to as ‘backward castes’. We have already noted in Chapter 
Six that the support for the Congress among many sections of the 
‘backward castes’ had declined. This created a space for non-Congress 
parties that drew more support from these communities. You would 
recall that the rise of these parties first found political expression 
at the national level in the form of the Janata Party government in 
1977. Many of the constituents of the Janata Party, like the Bharatiya 
Kranti Dal and the Samyukta Socialist Party, had a powerful rural 
base among some sections of the OBC.

‘Mandal’ implemented

of the Mandal Commission further helped in shaping the politics of 
‘Other Backward Classes’. The intense national debate for and against 
reservation in jobs made people from the OBC communities more 
aware of this identity. Thus, it helped those who wanted to mobilise 
these groups in politics. This period saw the emergence of many 
parties that sought better opportunities for OBCs in education and 
employment and also raised the question of the share of power enjoyed 
by the OBCs. These parties claimed that since OBCs constituted a 
large segment of Indian society, it was only democratic that the OBCs 
should get adequate representation in administration and have their 
due share of political power. 

Implementation of Mandal Commission report sparked off agitations and political upheavals.

reservations for backward castes in north India and at the national level was 
strongly raised. Karpoori Thakur, the then Chief Minister	of	Bihar,	was	a	pioneer	
in this direction. His government had introduced a new policy of reservations for

Political fallouts

The 1980s also saw the rise of political organisation of the Dalits. 
In 1978 the Backward and Minority Communities Employees 
Federation (BAMCEF) was formed. This organisation was not an 
ordinary trade union of government employees. It took a strong 
position	 in	 favour	 of	 political	 power	 to	 the	 ‘bahujan’	 –	 the	 SC,	
ST, OBC and minorities. It was out of this that the subsequent 
Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti and later the Bahujan 
Samaj Party (BSP) emerged under the leadership of Kanshi 
Ram. The BSP began as a small party supported largely by Dalit 
voters in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. But in 1989 and 
the 1991 elections, it achieved a breakthrough in Uttar Pradesh. 
This was the first time in independent India that a political 
party supported mainly by Dalit voters had achieved this kind of 
political success. 

In fact, the BSP, under Kanshi Ram’s leadership was envisaged 
as an organisation based on pragmatic politics. It derived 
confidence from the fact that the Bahujans (SC, ST, OBC and 
religious minorities)  constituted the majority of the population, 
and were a formidable political force on the strength of their 
numbers.  Since then the BSP has emerged as a major political 
player in the State and has been in government on more than one 
occasion. Its strongest support still comes from Dalit voters, but 
it has expanded its support now to various other social groups. In 
many parts of India, Dalit politics and OBC politics have developed Kanshi Ram  
independently and often in competition with each other. (1934-2006):

Communalism, Sularism, Democracy
The other long-term development during this period was the visible 
rise of politics based on religious identity leading to a debate 
about secularism and democracy. We noted in Chapter Six that 
in the aftermath of the Emergency, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh had 
merged with the Janata Party. After the fall of the Janata Party and 
its break-up, the supporters of erstwhile Jana Sangh formed the 
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1980. Initially, the BJP adopted 
a broader political platform than that of the Jana Sangh. BJP 
embraced ‘Gandhian’ Socialism’ along with cultural nationalism as 
its ideology. But it did not get much success in the elections held in 
1984. After 1986, the party began to emphasise nationalism as the 
core of its ideology. The BJP also pursued the politics of ‘Hindutva’ 
for political mobilisation.     

Hindutva was popularised by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, as the 
basis of Indian nationhood. It basically meant that to be an Indian, 
one must accept India as their ‘fatherland’ (pitrubhu) as well as their 
holy land (punyabhu). Believers of ‘Hindutva’ argue that a strong 
nation can be built on the basis of a united national culture. They 
also believe that in the case of India, Hindutva can provide this base.

Two developments around 1986 became central to the politics of 
BJP. The first was the Shah Bano case in 1985. In this case a 62-
year old divorced Muslim woman, had filed a case for maintenance 
from her former husband. The Supreme Court ruled in favour of 
Shah Bano. The orthodox Muslims saw the Supreme Court’s order 
as an interference in Muslim Personal Law. On the demand of 
some Muslim leaders, the government passed the Muslim Women 
(Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 that nullified the Supreme 
Court’s judgement. This action of the government was opposed 
by many women’s organisations, many Muslim groups and most 
of the intellectuals. The BJP criticised this action of the Congress 
government as an unnecessary concession and ‘appeasement’ of the 
minority community.

structure was built at the site of Shri Ram’s birth place in 1528, 
but the structure had visible display of Hindu symbols and relics in 
its interior as well as its exterior portions. Therefore, Ayodhya Ram 
Janmabhoomi issue got linked to the national pride in its ancient 
civilization. Over the years, this issue evolved into a prolonged legal 
battle, leading to the structure being sealed in 1949 due to the onset 
of court proceedings.     

 In 1986, the situation regarding the three-dome structure took a 
significant turn when the Faizabad (now Ayodhya) district court ruled 
to unlock the structure, allowing people to worship there. The dispute 
had been going on for many decades as it was believed that the three-
dome structure was built at Shri Ram’s birthplace after demolition 
of a temple. However, although Shilaanyas for the temple was done, 
further construction remained prohibited. The Hindu community 
felt that their concerns related to the birth place of Shri Ram were 
overlooked, while the Muslim community sought assurance of their 
possession over the structure. Subsequently, tensions heightened 
between both communities over ownership rights, resulting in 
numerous disputes and legal conflicts. Both communities desired 
a fair resolution to the longstanding issue. In 1992, following the 
demolition of the structure, some critics contended that it presented 
a substantial challenge to the principles of Indian democracy.

From Legal Proceedings to Amicable Acceptance 

It is important to note that in any society conflicts are bound to take 
place. However, in a multi -religious and multi-cultural democratic 
society, these conflicts are usually resolved following the due process 
of law. Through a number of democratic and legal procedures 
including court hearings, mediation attempts, popular movements, 
and finally with a 5-0 verdict of a constitutional bench of the Supreme 
Court on November 9, 2019, the Ayodhya issue was resolved. This 
verdict sought to reconcile the conflicting interests of the various 
stakeholders involved in the dispute. 

The verdict allotted the disputed site to the Shri Ram 
Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust for the construction of Ram 
temple and directed the concerned government to allot appropriate 
site for the construction of a Mosque to the Sunni Central Waqf 
Board. In this way, democracy gives room for conflict resolution 
in a plural society like ours, upholding the inclusive spirit of the 
Constitution. This issue was resolved following the due process of 
law based on evidences such as archaeological excavations and 
historical records. The Supreme Court’s decision was celebrated by 
the society at large. It is a classic example of consensus building 
on a sensitive issue that shows the maturity of democratic ethos 
which are civilizationally ingrained in India.

Emergence  a new consensus
The period after 1989 is seen sometimes as the period of decline of 
Congress and rise of BJP. If you want to understand the complex 
nature of political competition in this period, you have to compare the 
electoral performances of the Congress and the BJP.

Now let us try to understand the meaning of the information given in 
the figure. 

•	 You will notice that BJP and Congress were engaged in a tough 
competition in this period. What is the difference between their 
electoral fortunes if you compare these with the 1984 elections? 

.•	 You	will	notice	that	since	the	1989	election,	the	votes	polled	by	
the	two	parties,	Congress	and	the	BJP,	most	of	the	time,	add	up	
to	more	than	fifty	per	cent	except	in	1996,	2004	and	2009.		

•	 Look	at	both	the	charts	showing	Congress	and	Janata	‘family’	of	
parties. Which among the parties that exist today are neither part 
of Congress family of parties nor part of Janata family of parties? 

•	 The	political	competition	during	the	nineties	 is	divided	between	
the coalition led by BJP and the coalition led by the Congress. Can 
you list the parties that are not part of any of these two coalitions? 

Lok Sabha Elections (2004-2019)

In	the	elections	of	2004,	the	Congress	party	too	entered	into	coalitions	
in	a	big	way.	The	National	Democratic	Alliance	 (NDA)	was	defeated	
and	a	new	coalition	government	led	by	the	Congress,	known	as	the	
United	Progressive	Alliance	 (UPA)	 came	 to	power.	This	 government	
received	support	 from	the	Left	Front	parties.	The	elections	of	2004	
also witnessed the partial revival of Congress party. It could increase

its	seats	once	again	after	1991.	However,	in	the	2004	elections,	there	
was a negligible difference between the votes polled by the Congress 
and its allies and the BJP and its allies. 

The	Congress	led	UPA	government	completed	its	term	despite	Left	
parties	withdrawing	the	support	in	July	2008	on	the	issue	of	Indo-	
US	nuclear	deal.	Elections	 for	15th	Lok	Sabha	were	held	 in	2009.	
Results	witnessed	a	rise	in	the	number	of	seats	(from	145	in	2004	to	
206	in	2009)	of	the	Indian	National	Congress	(INC)	and	Congress	led	
UPA	Government.	Dr.	Manmohan	Singh	was	sworn	as	Prime	Minister	
for	the	second	term,	heading	the	coalition	government	of	UPA	again.	

Bhartiya	 Janata	 Party	 declared	 Narendra	Modi	 (then	 the	 Chief	
Minister	of	Gujrat)	as	 its	Prime	Ministerial	candidate	 in	September	
2013.	BJP	under	the	leadership	of	Narendra	Modi	got	a	clear	majority	
in	16th	Lok	Sabha	elections	held	in	2014.	BJP	won	282	seats	on	its	
own,	becoming	the	first	party	to	gain	single	party	majority	after	30	
years.	 Despite	 single-party	majority	 of	 its	 own,	 BJP	 did	 choose	 to	
form	the	NDA	government	with	its	coalition	partners.

Year	2014	was	a	proverbial	watershed	moment	of	Indian	politics.	
Narendra	Modi	led	NDA	government	rapidly	took	decisions	in	social	
sector,	foreign	policy	and	economic	policy.

The	BJP	again	emerged	victorious	with	303	seats	of	 its	own	 in	
2019	 Lok	 Sabha	 election.	 Even	 when	 BJP	 is	 getting	 full	majority,	
the	recognition	of	coalition	politics	 is	still	relevant.	Thus,	the	party	
system has now changed almost dramatically from what it was till 
the seventies.

Growing consensus

However,	 on	many	crucial	 issues,	a	broad	agreement	has	emerged	
among most parties. In the midst of severe competition and many 
conflicts,	a	consensus	appears	to	have	emerged	among	most	parties.	
This	consensus	consists	of	four	elements.	

First,	agreement	on	new	economic	policies	–	while	many	groups	
are	opposed	to	the	new	economic	policies,		most	political	parties	
are	in	support	of	the		new	economic	policies.	Most	parties	believe	

that these policies would lead the country to prosperity and a status 
of economic power in the world. 

econd,	 	 acceptance	 of	 the	 political	 and	 social	 claims	 of	 the	

Sbackward	 castes	 –	 political	 parties	 have	 recognised	 that	 the	
social	and	political	claims	of	 the	backward	castes	need	to	be	

accepted.	 As	 a	 result,	 all	 political	 parties	 now	 support	 reservation	
of	 seats	 for	 the	 ‘backward	 classes’	 in	 education	 and	 employment.

Political parties are also willing to ensure that the OBCs get adequate 
share of power.

Third,	acceptance	of	the	role	of	State	level	parties	in	governance	
of	the	country	–	the	distinction	between	State	level	and	national	
level	parties	is	fast	becoming	less	important.	As	we	saw	in	this	

chapter,	State	 level	 parties	 are	 sharing	power	at	 the	national	 level	
and	have	played	a	central	role	in	the	country’s	politics	of	last	twenty	
years or so.  

Fourth,	 emphasis	 on	 pragmatic	 considerations	 rather	 than	
ideological positions and political alliances without ideological 
agreement	–	coalition	politics	has	shifted	the	focus	of	political	

parties from ideological differences to power sharing arrangements. 
Thus,	 most	 parties	 of	 the	 NDA	 did	 not	 agree	 with	 the	 ‘Hindutva’	
ideology	of	 the	BJP.	Yet,	 they	came	together	 to	 form	a	government	
and remained in power for a full term.  

All	these	are	momentous	changes	and	are	going	to	shape	politics	
in the near future. We started this study of politics in India with the 
discussion	of	how	the	Congress	emerged	as	a	dominant	party.	From	
that	situation,	we	have	now	arrived	at	a	more	competitive	politics,	
but politics that is based on a certain implicit agreement among the 
main	political	actors.	Thus,	even	as	political	parties	act	within	 the	
sphere	 of	 this	 consensus,	 popular	 movements	 and	 organisations	
are	simultaneously	 identifying	new	 forms,	visions	and	pathways	of	
development.	 Issues	 like	 poverty,	 displacement,	 minimum	 wages,	
livelihood and social security are being put on the political agenda 
by	 peoples’	 movements,	 reminding	 the	 state	 of	 its	 responsibility.	
Similarly,	 issues	 of	 justice	 and	democracy	 are	being	 voiced	by	 the	
people	in	terms	of	class,	caste,	gender	and	regions.		We	cannot	predict	
the	 future	of	democracy.	All	we	know	 is	 that	democratic	politics	 is	
here to stay in India and that it will unfold through a continuous 
churning of some of the factors mentioned in this chapter.

As you know around the time of India’s independence, many other 
countries also became independent and adopted democracy. However, 
even India emerged as a mature democracy playing a great role in 
promoting social equality and   national development, the same has not 
been the case in some of those countries.

Discuss amongst yourselves the factors that have enabled democracy to 
thrive in India.

accommodate diverse interests, …. . An important test facing the polity is 
to evolve a party system or political parties that can effectively articulate 
and aggregate a variety of interests. — Zoya Hasan
