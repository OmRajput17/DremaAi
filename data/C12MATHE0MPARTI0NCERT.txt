RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS

vThere is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics ... . It may
be very hard to define mathematical beauty but that is just as true of

beauty of any kind, we may not know quite what we mean by a
beautiful poem, but that does not prevent us from recognising

one when we read it. — G. H. HARDY v

1.1  Introduction
Recall that the notion of relations and functions, domain,
co-domain and range have been introduced in Class XI
along with different types of specific real valued functions
and their graphs. The concept of the term ‘relation’ in
mathematics has been drawn from the meaning of relation
in English language, according to which two objects or
quantities are related if there is a recognisable connection
or link between the two objects or quantities. Let  A be
the set of students of Class XII of a school and B be the
set of students of Class XI of the same school. Then some
of the examples of relations from A to B are

(i) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: a is brother of b}, Lejeune Dirichlet

(ii) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: a is sister of b},  (1805-1859)

(iii) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: age of a is greater than age of b},
(iv) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: total marks obtained by a in the final examination is less than

the total marks obtained by b in the final examination},
(v) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: a lives in the same locality as b}.  However, abstracting from

this, we define mathematically a relation R from A to B as an arbitrary subset
of A × B.

If (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b under the relation R and we write as
a R b. In general, (a, b) ∈ R, we do not bother whether there is a recognisable
connection or link between a and b. As seen in Class XI, functions are special kind of
relations.

In this chapter, we will study different types of relations and functions, composition
of functions, invertible functions and binary operations.

1.2  Types of Relations

In this section, we would like to study different types of relations. We know that a
relation in a set A is a subset of A × A. Thus, the empty set φ and A × A are two
extreme relations. For illustration, consider a relation R in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} given by
R = {(a, b): a – b = 10}. This is the empty set, as no pair (a, b) satisfies the condition
a – b = 10. Similarly, R′ = {(a, b) : | a – b | ≥ 0} is the whole set A × A, as all pairs
(a, b) in A × A satisfy | a – b | ≥ 0. These two extreme examples lead us to the
following definitions.

Definition 1 A relation R in a set A is called empty relation, if no element of A is
related to any element of A, i.e., R = φ ⊂ A × A.

Definition 2  A relation R in a set A is called universal relation, if each element of A
is related to every element of A, i.e., R = A × A.

Both the empty relation and the universal relation are some times called trivial
relations.

Example 1 Let A be the set of all students of a boys school. Show that the relation R
in A given by R = {(a, b) : a is sister of b} is the empty relation and R′ = {(a, b) : the
difference between heights of a and b is less than 3 meters} is the universal relation.

Solution Since the school is boys school, no student of the school can be sister of any
student of the school. Hence, R = φ, showing that R is the empty relation. It is also
obvious that the difference between heights of any two students of the school has to be
less than 3 meters. This shows that R′ = A × A is the universal relation.

Remark In Class XI, we have seen two ways of representing a relation, namely raster
method and set builder method. However, a relation R in the set {1, 2, 3, 4} defined by R
= {(a, b) : b = a + 1} is also expressed as a R b if and only if
b = a + 1 by many authors. We may also use this notation, as and when convenient.

If (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b and we denote it as a R b.

One of the most important relation, which plays a significant role in Mathematics,
is an equivalence relation. To study equivalence relation, we first consider three
types of relations, namely reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

Definition 3 A relation R in a set A is called

(i) reflexive, if (a, a) ∈ R, for every a ∈ A,
 

(ii) symmetric, if (a , a ) ∈ R implies that (a , a ) ∈ R, for all a , a  ∈ A.
1 2 2 1  1 2

(iii) transitive, if (a , a ) ∈ R and (a , a ) ∈ R implies that (a , a ) ∈ R, for all a , a ,

a  ∈ A.

Definition 4 A relation R in a set A is said to be an equivalence relation if R is
reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

Example 2 Let T be the set of all triangles in a plane with R a relation in T given by
R = {(T , T ) : T  is congruent to T }. Show that R is an equivalence relation.

1 2 1 2

Solution R is reflexive, since every triangle is congruent to itself. Further,
(T , T ) ∈ R ⇒ T  is congruent to T  ⇒ T  is congruent to T  ⇒ (T , T ) ∈ R. Hence,

1 2 1 2 2 1 2 1

R is symmetric. Moreover, (T , T ), (T , T ) ∈ R ⇒ T  is  congruent to T  and T  is
1 2 2 3 1 2 2

congruent to T  ⇒ T  is congruent to T  ⇒ (T , T ) ∈ R. Therefore, R is an equivalence

relation.

Example 3 Let L be the set of all lines in a plane and R be the relation in L defined as
R = {(L , L ) : L  is perpendicular to L }. Show that R is symmetric but neither

1 2 1 2

reflexive nor transitive.

Solution R is not reflexive, as a line L  can not be perpendicular to itself, i.e., (L , L )
1 1 1

∉ R. R is symmetric as (L , L ) ∈ R
1 2

⇒ L  is perpendicular to L
1 2

⇒ L  is perpendicular to L
2 1

⇒ (L , L ) ∈ R.
2 1

R is not transitive. Indeed, if L  is perpendicular to L  and
1 2 Fig 1.1

L  is perpendicular to L , then L  can never be perpendicular to
2 3 1

L . In fact, L  is parallel to L , i.e., (L , L ) ∈ R, (L , L ) ∈ R but (L , L ) ∉ R.
3 1 3 1 2 2 3 1 3

Example 4 Show that the relation R in the set {1, 2, 3} given by R = {(1, 1), (2, 2),
(3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)} is reflexive but neither symmetric nor transitive.

Solution R is reflexive, since (1, 1), (2, 2) and (3, 3) lie in R. Also, R is not symmetric,
as (1, 2) ∈ R but (2, 1) ∉ R. Similarly, R is not transitive, as (1, 2) ∈ R and (2, 3) ∈ R
but (1, 3) ∉ R.

Example 5 Show that the relation R in the set Z of integers given by

R = {(a, b) : 2 divides a – b}

is an equivalence relation.

Solution R is reflexive, as 2 divides (a – a) for all a ∈ Z. Further, if (a, b) ∈ R, then
2 divides a – b. Therefore, 2 divides b – a. Hence, (b, a) ∈ R, which shows that R is
symmetric. Similarly, if (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, then a – b and b – c are divisible by
2. Now, a – c = (a – b) + (b – c) is even (Why?). So, (a – c) is divisible by 2. This
shows that R is transitive. Thus, R is an equivalence relation in Z.

4 MATHEMATICS

In Example 5, note that all even integers are related to zero, as (0, ± 2), (0, ± 4)
etc., lie in R and no odd integer is related to 0, as (0, ± 1), (0, ± 3) etc., do not lie in R.
Similarly, all odd integers are related to one and no even integer is related to one.
Therefore, the set E of all even integers and the set O of all odd integers are subsets of
Z satisfying following conditions:

(i) All elements of E are related to each other and all elements of O are related to
each other.

(ii) No element of E is related to any element of O and vice-versa.

(iii) E and O are disjoint and Z = E ∪ O.

The subset E is called the equivalence class containing zero and is denoted by
[0]. Similarly, O is the equivalence class containing 1 and is denoted by [1]. Note that
[0] ≠ [1], [0] = [2r] and [1] = [2r + 1], r ∈ Z. Infact, what we have seen above is true
for an arbitrary equivalence relation R in a set X. Given an arbitrary equivalence
relation R in an arbitrary set X, R divides X into mutually disjoint subsets A  called

i

partitions or subdivisions  of X satisfying:

(i) all elements of A  are related to each other, for all i.
i

(ii) no element of A  is related to any element of A , i ≠ j.
i j

(iii) ∪ A  = X and A  ∩ A  = φ, i ≠ j.
j i j

The subsets A  are called equivalence classes. The interesting part of the situation
i

is that we can go reverse also. For example, consider a subdivision of the set Z given
by three mutually disjoint subsets A , A  and A  whose union is Z with

1 2 3

A  = {x ∈ Z : x is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 6, – 3, 0, 3, 6, ...}
1

A  = {x ∈ Z : x – 1 is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 5, – 2, 1, 4, 7, ...}
2

A  = {x ∈ Z : x – 2 is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 4, – 1, 2, 5, 8, ...}
3

Define a relation R in Z given by R = {(a, b) : 3 divides a – b}. Following the
arguments similar to those used in Example 5, we can show that R is an equivalence
relation. Also, A  coincides with the set of all integers in Z which are related to zero, A

1 2

coincides with the set of all integers which are related to 1 and A  coincides with the
3

set of all integers in Z which are related to 2. Thus, A  = [0], A  = [1] and A  = [2].
1 2 3

In fact, A  = [3r], A  = [3r + 1] and A  = [3r + 2], for all r ∈ Z.

Example 6 Let R be the relation defined in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} by
R = {(a, b) : both a and b are either odd or even}. Show that R is an equivalence
relation. Further, show that all the elements of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each
other and all the elements of the subset {2, 4, 6} are related to each other, but no
element of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} is related to any element of the subset {2, 4, 6}.

RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS 5

Solution Given any element a in A, both a and a must be either odd or even, so
that (a, a) ∈ R. Further, (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ both a and b must be either odd or even
⇒ (b, a) ∈ R. Similarly, (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R ⇒ all elements a, b, c, must be
either even or odd simultaneously ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R. Hence, R is an equivalence relation.
Further, all the elements of {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each other, as all the elements
of this subset are odd. Similarly, all the elements of the subset {2, 4, 6} are related to
each other, as all of them are even. Also, no element of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} can be
related to any element of {2, 4, 6}, as elements of {1, 3, 5, 7} are odd, while elements
of {2, 4, 6} are even.

1.3  Types of Functions

The notion of a function along with some special functions like identity function, constant
function, polynomial function, rational function, modulus function, signum function etc.
along with their graphs have been given in Class XI.

Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two functions have also been
studied. As the concept of function is of paramount importance in mathematics and
among other  disciplines as well, we would like to extend our study about function from
where we finished earlier. In this section, we would like to study different types of
functions.

Consider the functions  f , f , f  and f  given by the following diagrams.
1 2 3 4

In Fig 1.2, we observe that the images of distinct elements of X under the function
1 

f  are distinct, but the image of two distinct elements 1 and 2 of X  under f  is same,
1 1 2

namely b. Further, there are some elements like e and f in X  which are not images of
2

any element of X  under f , while all elements of X  are images of some elements of X
1 1 3 1

under f . The above observations lead to the following definitions:
3

Definition 5 A function f : X → Y is defined to be one-one (or injective), if the images
of distinct elements of X under f are distinct, i.e., for every x , x  ∈ X, f (x ) = f (x )

1 2 1 2

implies x  = x . Otherwise, f is called many-one.
1 2

The function f  and f in Fig 1.2 (i) and (iv) are one-one and the function f  and f
1 4 2 3

in Fig 1.2 (ii) and (iii) are many-one.

Definition 6 A function f : X → Y is said to be onto (or surjective), if every element
of Y is the image of some element of X under f, i.e., for every y ∈ Y, there exists an
element x in X such that f (x) = y.

The function f  and f in Fig 1.2 (iii), (iv) are onto and the function f  in Fig 1.2 (i) is
3 4 1

not onto as elements e, f in X  are not the image of any element in X  under f .

Remark  f : X → Y is onto if and only if Range of f = Y.

Definition 7 A function f : X → Y is said to be one-one and onto (or bijective), if f is

both one-one and onto.

The function f  in Fig 1.2 (iv) is one-one and onto.

Example 7 Let A be the set of all 50 students of Class X in a school. Let f : A → N be

function defined by f (x) = roll number of the student x. Show that f is one-one

but not onto.

Solution No two different students of the class can have same roll number. Therefore,

f must be one-one. We can assume without any loss of generality that roll numbers of

students are from 1 to 50. This implies that 51 in N is not roll number of any student of

the class, so that 51 can not be image of any element of X under f. Hence,  f is not onto.

Example 8 Show that the function f : N → N, given by f (x) = 2x, is one-one but not

onto.

Solution The function f is one-one, for f (x ) = f (x ) ⇒ 2x  = 2x  ⇒ x  = x . Further,
1 2 1 2 1 2

f is not onto, as for 1 ∈ N, there does not exist any x in N such that f (x) = 2x = 1.

Example 9  Prove that the function f : R → R, given by f (x) = 2x, is one-one and onto.

Solution  f is one-one, as f (x ) = f (x ) ⇒ 2x  = 2x  ⇒ x  = x . Also, given any real
1 2 1 2 1 2

y y y
number y in R, there exists  in R such that f ( ) = 2 . ( ) = y. Hence, f is onto.

Example 10  Show that the function f : N → N, given by f (1) = f (2) = 1 and f (x) = x – 1,
for every x > 2, is onto but not one-one.

Solution  f is not one-one, as f (1) = f (2) = 1. But f is onto, as given any y ∈ N, y ≠ 1,
we can choose x as y + 1 such that f (y + 1) = y + 1 – 1 = y. Also for 1 ∈ N, we
have f (1) = 1.

Example 11  Show that the function f : R → R,
defined as f (x) = x2, is neither one-one nor onto.

Solution  Since f (– 1) = 1 = f (1), f is not one-
one. Also, the element – 2 in the co-domain R is
not image of any element x in the domain R
(Why?). Therefore f is not onto.

Example 12  Show that f : N → N, given by

 x +1,if x is odd,
f (x) =  

 x −1,if x is even

Reprint 2025-26



10 MATHEMATICS

Solution  Suppose f (x ) = f (x ). Note that if x  is odd and x  is even, then we will have
1 2 1 2

x  + 1 = x  – 1, i.e., x  – x  = 2 which is impossible. Similarly, the possibility of x  being
1 2 2 1 1

even and x  being odd can also be ruled out, using the similar argument. Therefore,
2

both x  and x  must be either odd or even. Suppose both x  and x  are odd. Then
1 2 1 2

f (x ) = f (x ) ⇒ x  + 1 = x  + 1 ⇒ x  = x . Similarly, if both x  and x  are even, then also
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2

f (x ) = f (x ) ⇒ x  – 1 = x  – 1 ⇒ x  = x . Thus, f is one-one. Also, any odd number
1 2 1 2 1 2

2r + 1 in the co-domain N is the image of 2r + 2 in the domain N and any even number
2r in the co-domain N is the image of 2r – 1 in the domain N. Thus, f is onto.

Example 13 Show that an onto function f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3} is always one-one.

Solution Suppose f is not one-one. Then there exists two elements, say 1 and 2 in the
domain whose image in the co-domain is same. Also, the image of 3 under f can be
only one element. Therefore, the range set can have at the most two elements of the
co-domain {1, 2, 3}, showing that f  is not onto, a contradiction. Hence, f must be one-one.

Example 14 Show that a one-one function f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3} must be onto.

Solution Since f is one-one, three elements of {1, 2, 3} must be taken to 3 different
elements of the co-domain {1, 2, 3} under f. Hence, f has to be onto.

Remark The results mentioned in Examples 13 and 14 are also true for an arbitrary
finite set X, i.e., a one-one function f : X → X is necessarily onto and an onto map
f : X → X is necessarily one-one, for every finite set X. In contrast to this, Examples 8
and 10 show that for an infinite set, this may not be true. In fact, this is a characteristic
difference between a finite and an infinite set.

1.4  Composition of Functions and Invertible Function

Definition 8 Let f : A → B and g : B → C be two functions. Then the composition of
f and g, denoted by gof, is defined as the function gof : A → C given by

gof (x) = g(f (x)), ∀  x ∈ A.

Fig 1.5

Example 15 Let f : {2, 3, 4, 5} → {3, 4, 5, 9} and g : {3, 4, 5, 9} → {7, 11, 15} be
functions defined as f (2) = 3, f (3) = 4, f (4) =  f (5) = 5 and g (3) = g (4) = 7 and
g (5) =  g (9) = 11. Find gof.

Solution We have gof (2) =  g (f (2)) = g (3) = 7, gof (3) =  g (f (3)) = g (4) = 7,
gof (4) =  g (f (4)) = g (5) = 11 and gof (5) =  g (5) = 11.

Example 16 Find gof and fog, if f : R → R and g : R → R are given by f (x) = cos x
and g (x) = 3x2. Show that gof  ≠ fog.

Solution We have gof (x) =  g (f (x)) = g (cos x) = 3 (cos x)2 = 3 cos2 x. Similarly,
fog (x) =  f (g (x)) =  f (3x2) = cos (3x2). Note that 3cos2 x ≠ cos 3x2, for x = 0. Hence,
gof ≠ fog.
Definition 9 A function f : X → Y is defined to be invertible, if there exists a function
g : Y → X such that  gof = I  and fog = I . The function g is called the inverse of f  and

X Y

is denoted by f –1.

Thus, if f is invertible, then f must be one-one and onto and conversely, if f is
one-one and onto, then f must be invertible. This fact significantly helps for proving a

function f to be invertible by showing that f is one-one and onto, specially when the
actual inverse of f is not to be determined.

Example 17 Let f : N → Y be a function defined as f (x) = 4x + 3, where,
Y = {y ∈ N : y = 4x + 3 for some x ∈ N}. Show that f is invertible. Find the inverse.

Solution Consider an arbitrary element y of Y. By the definition of Y, y = 4x + 3,

(y − 3)
for some x in the domain N . This shows that x = . Define g : Y → N  by

Miscellaneous Examples

Example 18 If R  and R  are equivalence relations in a set A, show that R  ∩ R  is
1 2 1 2

also an equivalence relation.

Solution Since R  and R  are equivalence relations, (a, a) ∈ R , and (a, a) ∈ R  ∀ a ∈ A.
1 2 1 2

This implies that (a, a) ∈ R ∩ R , a, s owi g R e

1 1 2

(a, b) ∈ R ∩ R  ⇒ (a, b) ∈ R  and (a, b) ∈ R  ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R  and (b, a) ∈ R  ⇒
1 2 1 2 1 2

(b, a) ∈ R  ∩ R , hence, R ∩ R  is symmetric. Similarly, (a, b) ∈ R  ∩ R  and
1 2 1 2 1 2

(b, c) ∈ R ∩ R  ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R  and (a, c) ∈ R  ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R ∩ R . This shows that
1 2 1 2 1 2

R ∩ R  is transitive. Thus, R ∩ R  is an equivalence relation.
1 2 1 2

Example 19 Let R be a relation on the set A of ordered pairs of positive integers
defined by (x, y) R (u, v) if  and only if xv = yu. Show that R is an equivalence relation.

Solution Clearly, (x, y) R (x, y), ∀ (x, y) ∈ A, since xy = yx. This shows that R is
reflexive. Further, (x, y) R (u, v) ⇒ xv = yu ⇒ uy = vx and hence (u, v) R (x, y). This
shows that R is symmetric. Similarly, (x, y) R (u, v) and (u, v) R (a, b) ⇒ xv = yu and

a a b a
ub = va ⇒ xv = yu ⇒ xv = yu  ⇒ xb = ya and hence (x, y) R (a, b). Thus, R

u u v u
is transitive. Thus, R is an equivalence relation.

Example 20 Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let R  be a relation in X given
1

by R  = {(x, y) : x – y is divisible by 3} and R  be another relation on X given by
1 2

R  = {(x, y): {x, y} ⊂ {1, 4, 7}} or {x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8} or {x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9}}. Show that
2

R  = R .
1 2

Solution Note that the characteristic of sets {1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8} and {3, 6, 9} is
that difference between any two elements of these sets is a multiple of 3. Therefore,
(x, y) ∈ R  ⇒ x – y is a multiple of 3 ⇒ {x, y} ⊂ {1, 4, 7} or {x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8}

or {x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9} ⇒ (x, y) ∈ R . Hence, R  ⊂ R . Similarly, {x, y} ∈ R  ⇒ {x, y}

Example 21 Let f : X → Y be a function. Define a relation R in X given by
R = {(a, b): f(a) = f(b)}. Examine whether R is an equivalence relation or not.

Solution For every a ∈ X, (a, a) ∈ R, since f (a) = f (a), showing that R is reflexive.
Similarly, (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ f (a) = f (b) ⇒ f (b) = f (a) ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R. Therefore, R is
symmetric. Further, (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R ⇒ f (a) = f (b) and f (b) = f (c) ⇒ f (a)
= f (c) ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R, which implies that R is transitive. Hence, R is an equivalence
relation.

Example 22 Find the number of all one-one functions from set A = {1, 2, 3} to itself.

Solution One-one function from {1, 2, 3} to itself is simply a permutation on three
symbols 1, 2, 3. Therefore, total number of one-one maps from {1, 2, 3} to itself is
same as total number of permutations on three symbols 1, 2, 3 which is 3! = 6.

Example 23 Let A = {1, 2, 3}. Then show that  the number of relations containing (1, 2)
and (2, 3) which are reflexive and transitive but not symmetric is three.

Solution The smallest relation R  containing (1, 2) and (2, 3) which is reflexive and
1

transitive but not symmetric is {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)}. Now, if we add
the pair (2, 1) to R  to get R , then the relation R  will be reflexive, transitive but not

1 2 2

symmetric. Similarly, we can obtain R  by adding (3, 2) to R  to get the desired relation.
3 1

However, we can not add two pairs (2, 1), (3, 2) or single pair (3, 1) to R  at a time, as
1

by doing so, we will be forced to add the remaining pair in order to maintain transitivity
and in the process, the relation will become symmetric also which is not required. Thus,
the total number of desired relations is three.

Example 24  Show that the number of equivalence relation in the set {1, 2, 3} containing
(1, 2) and (2, 1) is two.

Solution The smallest equivalence relation R  containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is {(1, 1),
1

(2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1)}. Now we are left with only 4 pairs namely (2, 3), (3, 2),
(1, 3) and (3, 1). If we add any one, say (2, 3) to R , then for symmetry we must add

1

(3, 2) also and now for transitivity we are forced to add (1, 3) and (3, 1). Thus, the only
equivalence relation bigger than R  is the universal relation. This shows that the total

1

number of equivalence relations containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is two.

Summary

In this chapter, we studied different types of relations and equivalence relation,
composition of functions, invertible functions and binary operations. The main features
of this chapter are as follows:

® Empty relation is the relation R in X given by R = φ ⊂ X × X.

® Universal relation is the relation R in X given by R = X × X.

® Reflexive relation R in X is a relation with (a, a) ∈ R ∀ a ∈ X.

® Symmetric relation R in X is a relation satisfying (a, b) ∈ R implies (b, a) ∈ R.

® Transitive relation R in X is a relation satisfying (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R
implies that (a, c) ∈ R.

® Equivalence relation R in X is a relation which is reflexive, symmetric and
transitive.

® Equivalence class [a] containing a ∈ X for an equivalence relation R in X is
the subset of X containing all elements b related to a.

® A function f : X → Y is one-one (or injective) if

f (x ) = f (x ) ⇒ x  = x   x , x  ∈ X.

® A function f : X → Y is onto (or surjective) if given any y ∈ Y, ∃ x ∈ X such
that f (x) = y.

® A function f : X → Y is one-one and onto (or bijective), if f is both one-one
and onto.

® Given a finite set X, a function f : X → X is one-one (respectively onto) if and
only if f is onto (respectively one-one). This is the characteristic property of a
finite set. This is not true for infinite set

Historical Note
The concept of function has evolved over a long period of time starting from

R. Descartes (1596-1650), who used the word ‘function’ in his manuscript
“Geometrie” in 1637 to mean some positive integral power xn of a variable x
while studying geometrical curves like hyperbola, parabola and ellipse. James
Gregory (1636-1675) in his work “ Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura”
(1667) considered function as a quantity obtained from other quantities by
successive use of algebraic operations or by any other operations. Later G. W.
Leibnitz (1646-1716) in his manuscript “Methodus tangentium inversa, seu  de
functionibus” written in 1673 used the word ‘function’ to mean a quantity varying
from point to point on a curve such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the
slope of the curve, the tangent and the normal to the curve at a point. However,
in his manuscript “Historia” (1714), Leibnitz used the word ‘function’ to mean
quantities that depend on a variable. He was the first to use the phrase ‘function
of x’. John Bernoulli (1667-1748) used the notation φx for the first time in 1718 to
indicate a function of x. But the general adoption of symbols like f, F, φ, ψ ... to
represent functions was made by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in 1734 in the first
part of his manuscript “Analysis Infinitorium”. Later on, Joeph Louis Lagrange
(1736-1813) published his manuscripts “Theorie des functions analytiques” in
1793, where he discussed  about analytic function and used the notion f (x), F(x),
φ (x) etc. for different function of x. Subsequently, Lejeunne Dirichlet
(1805-1859) gave the definition of function which was being used till the set
theoretic definition of function presently used, was given after set theory was
developed by Georg Cantor (1845-1918). The set theoretic definition of function
known to us presently is simply an abstraction of the definition given by Dirichlet
in a rigorous manner.

INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC
FUNCTIONS

vMathematics, in general, is fundamentally the science of

self-evident things. — FELIX KLEIN v

2.1  Introduction

In Chapter 1, we have studied that the inverse of a function
f, denoted by f –1, exists if f is one-one and onto. There are
many functions which are not one-one, onto or both and
hence we can not talk of their inverses. In Class XI, we
studied that trigonometric functions are not one-one and
onto over their natural domains and ranges and hence their
inverses do not exist. In this chapter, we shall study about
the restrictions on domains and ranges of trigonometric
functions which ensure the existence of their inverses and
observe their behaviour through graphical representations.
Besides, some elementary properties will also be discussed.

The inverse trigonometric functions play an important Aryabhata
 (476-550 A. D.)

role in calculus for they serve to define many integrals.
The concepts of inverse trigonometric functions is also used in science and engineering.

2.2  Basic Concepts

In Class XI, we have studied trigonometric functions, which are defined as follows:

sine function, i.e., sine : R → [– 1, 1]

cosine function, i.e., cos : R → [– 1, 1]

π
tangent function, i.e., tan : R – { x : x = (2n + 1) , n ∈ Z} → R

2
cotangent function, i.e., cot : R – { x : x = nπ, n ∈ Z} → R

π
secant function, i.e., sec : R – { x : x = (2n + 1) , n ∈ Z} → R – (– 1, 1)

2
cosecant function, i.e., cosec : R – { x : x = nπ,  n ∈ Z} → R – (– 1, 1)

INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS     19

We have also learnt in Chapter 1 that if f : X→Y such that f (x) = y is one-one and
onto, then we can define a unique function g : Y→X such that g (y) = x, where x ∈ X
and y = f (x), y ∈ Y. Here, the domain of g = range of f and the range of g =  domain
of f. The function g is called the inverse of f and is denoted by f –1. Further, g is also
one-one and onto and inverse of g is f. Thus, g–1 = (f –1)–1 = f. We also have

(f –1 o f ) (x) = f –1 (f (x)) = f –1(y) = x

and (f o f –1) (y) = f (f –1(y))  = f (x) = y

Since the domain of sine function is the set of all real numbers and range is the

2  2 2 
therefore, define the inverse of sine function in each of these intervals. We denote the
inverse of sine function by sin–1 (arc sine function). Thus, sin–1 is a function whose

sin y = x.

Remarks

(i) We know from Chapter 1, that if y = f (x) is an invertible function, then  x = f –1 (y).
Thus, the graph of sin–1 function can be obtained from the graph of original
function  by interchanging x and y axes, i.e., if (a, b) is a point on the graph of
sine function, then (b, a) becomes the corresponding point on the graph of inverse

of sine function. Thus, the graph of the function y = sin–1 x can be obtained from
the graph of y = sin x by interchanging x and y axes. The graphs of y = sin x and
y = sin–1 x are as given in Fig 2.1 (i), (ii), (iii). The dark portion of the graph of
y = sin–1 x represent the principal value branch.

(ii) It can be shown that the graph of an inverse function can be obtained from the
corresponding graph of original function as a mirror image (i.e., reflection) along
the line y = x. This can be visualised by looking the graphs of y = sin x and

y = sin–1 x as given in the same axes (Fig 2.1 (iii)).

Like sine function, the cosine function is a function whose domain is the set of all
real numbers and range is the set [–1, 1]. If we restrict the domain of cosine function
to [0, π], then it becomes one-one and onto with range [–1, 1]. Actually,  cosine function

INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS     21

restricted to any of the intervals [– π, 0],  [0,π], [π, 2π] etc., is bijective with range as

[–1, 1]. We can, therefore, define the inverse of cosine function in each of these

intervals. We denote the inverse of the cosine function by cos–1 (arc cosine function).

Thus, cos–1 is a function whose domain is [–1, 1] and range

could be any of the intervals [–π, 0], [0, π], [π, 2π] etc.

Corresponding to each such interval, we get a branch of the

function cos–1. The branch with range [0, π] is called the principal

value branch of the function cos–1. We write

cos–1 : [–1, 1] → [0, π].

The graph of the function given by y = cos–1 x can be drawn

in the same way as discussed about the graph of y = sin–1 x. The

graphs of y = cos x and y = cos–1 x are given in Fig 2.2 (i) and (ii).

Let us now discuss cosec–1x and sec–1x as follows:

Since, cosec x = , the domain of the cosec function is the set {x : x ∈ R and
sin x

x ≠ nπ, n ∈ Z} and the range is the set {y : y ∈ R, y ≥ 1 or y ≤ –1} i.e., the set
R – (–1, 1). It means that y = cosec x assumes all real values except –1 < y < 1 and is
not defined for integral multiple of π. If we restrict the domain of cosec function to

Also, since sec x = , the domain of y = sec x is the set R – {x : x = (2n + 1) ,

cos x 2

defined for integral multiples of π. If we restrict the domain of cotangent function to
(0, π), then it is bijective with and its range as R. In fact, cotangent function restricted
to any of the intervals (–π, 0), (0, π), (π, 2π) etc., is bijective and its range is R. Thus

2.3  Properties of Inverse Trigonometric Functions

In this section, we shall prove some important properties of inverse trigonometric
functions. It may be mentioned here that these results are valid within the principal
value branches of the corresponding inverse trigonometric functions and wherever
they are defined. Some results may not be valid for all values of the domains of inverse
trigonometric functions. In fact, they will be valid only for some values of x for which
inverse trigonometric functions are defined. We will not go into the details of these
values of x in the domain as this discussion goes beyond the scope of this textbook.

Let us recall that if y = sin–1x, then x = sin y and if x = sin y, then y = sin–1x. This
is equivalent to


sin (sin–1 x) = x, x ∈  [– 1, 1] and sin–1 (sin x) = x, x ∈ −π π

 ,
 2 2 

For suitable values of  domain similar results follow for remaining trigonometric
functions.

INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS     33

Historical Note

The study of trigonometry was first started in India. The ancient Indian
Mathematicians, Aryabhata (476A.D.), Brahmagupta (598 A.D.), Bhaskara I
(600 A.D.) and Bhaskara II (1114 A.D.) got important results of trigonometry. All
this knowledge went from India to Arabia and then from there to Europe. The
Greeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so
clumsy that when the Indian approach became known, it was immediately adopted
throughout the world.

In India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as
the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents one of
the main contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to
mathematics.

Bhaskara I (about 600 A.D.) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions
for angles more than 90°. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa
contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for sines or
cosines of 18°, 36°, 54°, 72°, etc., were given by Bhaskara II.

The symbols sin–1 x, cos–1 x, etc., for arc sin x, arc cos x, etc., were suggested
by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The name of Thales
(about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He
is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by
measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known
height, and comparing the ratios:

H h
=  = tan (sun’s altitude)

S s

Thales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through
the proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance
using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.

3.1  Introduction

The knowledge of matrices is necessary in various branches of mathematics. Matrices

are one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. This mathematical tool simplifies

our work to a great extent when compared with other straight forward methods. The

evolution of concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and

simple methods of solving system of linear equations. Matrices are not only used as a

representation of the coefficients in system of linear equations, but utility of matrices

far exceeds that use. Matrix notation and operations are used in electronic spreadsheet

programs for personal computer, which in turn is used in different areas of business

and science like budgeting, sales projection, cost estimation, analysing the results of an

experiment etc. Also, many physical operations such as magnification, rotation and

reflection through a plane can be represented mathematically by matrices. Matrices

are also used in cryptography. This mathematical tool is not only used in certain branches

of sciences, but also in genetics, economics, sociology, modern psychology and industrial

management.

In this chapter, we shall find it interesting to become acquainted with the

fundamentals of matrix and matrix algebra.

express it as [15] with the understanding that the number inside [ ] is the number of

notebooks that Radha has. Now, if we have to express that Radha has 15 notebooks

and 6 pens. We may express it as [15  6] with the understanding that first number

inside [ ] is the number of notebooks while the other one is the number of pens possessed

by Radha. Let us now suppose that we wish to express the information of possession

of notebooks and pens by Radha and her two friends Fauzia and Simran which

is as follows:

Radha has 15 notebooks and 6 pens,

Fauzia has 10 notebooks and 2 pens,

Simran has 13 notebooks and 5 pens.

Now this could be arranged in the tabular form as follows:

Notebooks Pens

Radha 15 6

Fauzia 10 2

Simran 13 5

and this can be expressed as

or
Radha Fauzia Simran

Notebooks 15 10 13

Pens 6 2 5

which can be expressed as:

In the first arrangement the entries in the first column represent the number of
note books possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively and the entries in the
second column represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran,

Reprint 2025-26

respectively. Similarly, in the second arrangement, the entries in the first row represent
the number of notebooks possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. The
entries in the second row represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia
and Simran, respectively. An arrangement or display of the above kind is called a
matrix. Formally, we define matrix as:

Definition 1  A matrix is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions. The
numbers or functions are called the elements or the entries of the matrix.

We denote matrices by capital letters. The following are some examples of matrices:

 1
+ − 

 2
– 2 5   i 3

A =  0 5 , B =  3.5 –1 2  ,  C =  

 3 6   5  cos x sin x + 2 tan x
  3 5 

 7 

In the above examples, the horizontal lines of elements are said to constitute, rows
of the matrix and the vertical lines of elements are said to constitute, columns of the
matrix. Thus A has 3 rows and 2 columns, B has 3 rows and 3 columns while C has 2
rows and 3 columns.

3.2.1  Order of a matrix

A matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix of order m × n or simply m × n
matrix (read as an m by n matrix). So referring to the above examples of matrices, we
have A as 3 × 2 matrix, B as 3 × 3 matrix and C as 2 × 3 matrix. We observe that A has
3 × 2 = 6 elements, B and C have 9 and 6 elements, respectively.

In general, an m × n matrix has the following rectangular array:

or A = [a ] , 1≤ i ≤ m, 1≤ j ≤ n   i, j ∈ N
ij m × n

Thus the ith  row consists of the elements a , a , a ,..., a , while the jth column
i1 i2 i3 in

consists of the elements a , a , a ,..., a ,
1j 2j 3j mj

In general a , is an element lying in the ith row and jth column. We can also call
ij

it as the (i, j)th element of A. The number of elements in an m × n matrix will be
equal to mn.

MATRICES         37

ANote  In this chapter

1. We shall follow the notation, namely A = [a ]  to indicate that A is a matrix
ij m × n

of order m × n.

2. We shall consider only those matrices whose elements are real numbers or
functions taking real values.

We can also represent any point (x, y) in a plane by a matrix (column or row) as

 x
   (or [x, y]). For example point P(0, 1) as a matrix representation may be given as
 y

0
P =    or [0 1].

1
Observe that in this way we can also express the vertices of a closed rectilinear

figure in the form of a matrix. For example, consider a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices
A (1, 0), B (3, 2), C (1, 3), D (–1, 2).

Now, quadrilateral ABCD in the matrix form, can be represented as

A B C D A  1 0
1 3 1 −1  

X =   or Y =  

0 2 3 2 × C  1 3
2 4  

D −1 24×2

Thus, matrices can be used as representation of vertices of geometrical figures in
a plane.

Now, let us consider some examples.

Example 1 Consider the following information regarding the number of men and women
workers in three factories I, II and III

Men workers Women workers

I 30 25

Represent the above information in the form of a 3 × 2 matrix. What does the entry

Solution The information is represented in the form of a 3 × 2 matrix as follows:

30 25

27 26

The entry in the third row and second column represents the number of women
workers in factory III.

Example 2 If a matrix has 8 elements, what are the possible orders it can have?

Solution We know that if a matrix is of order m × n, it has mn elements. Thus, to find

all possible orders of a matrix with 8 elements, we will find all ordered pairs of natural
numbers, whose product is 8.
Thus, all possible ordered pairs are (1, 8), (8, 1), (4, 2), (2, 4)

Hence, possible orders are 1 × 8, 8 ×1, 4 × 2, 2 × 4

Example 3 Construct a 3 × 2 matrix whose elements are given by aij = | i − 3 j | .

The above is an example of multiplication of matrices. We observe that, for

multiplication of two matrices A and B, the number of columns in A should be equal to
the number of rows in B. Furthermore for getting the elements of the product matrix,
we take rows of A and columns of B, multiply them element-wise and take the sum.
Formally, we define multiplication of matrices as follows:

The product of two matrices A and B is defined if the number of columns of A is
equal to the number of rows of B. Let A = [a ] be an m × n matrix and B = [b ] be an

ij jk

n × p matrix. Then the product of the matrices A and B is the matrix C of order m × p.

Remark  If AB is defined, then BA need not be defined. In the above example, AB is
defined but BA is not defined because B has 3 column while A has only 2 (and not 3)
rows. If A, B are, respectively m × n, k × l matrices, then both AB and BA are defined
if and only if n = k and l = m. In particular, if both A and B are square matrices of the
same order, then both AB and BA are defined.

Non-commutativity of multiplication of matrices

Now, we shall see by an example that even if AB and BA are both defined, it is not
necessary that AB = BA.

Solution Since A is a 2 × 3 matrix and B is 3 × 2 matrix. Hence AB and BA are both
defined and are matrices of order 2 × 2 and 3 × 3, respectively. Note that

Clearly AB ≠ BA

In the above example both AB and BA are of different order and so AB ≠ BA. But
one may think that perhaps AB and BA could be the same if they were of the same
order. But it is not so, here we give an example to show that even if AB and BA are of
same order they may not be same.

Observe that multiplication of diagonal matrices of same order will be commutative.

Zero matrix as the product of two non zero matrices

We know that, for real numbers a, b if ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0. This need
not be true for matrices, we will observe this through an example.

0 −1 3 5
Example 15 Find AB, if A =    and B =   .

Thus, if the product of two matrices is a zero matrix, it is not necessary that one of

the matrices is a zero matrix.

3.4.6  Properties of multiplication of matrices

The multiplication of matrices possesses the following properties, which we state without
proof.

1. The associative law For any three matrices A, B and C. We have

(AB) C = A (BC), whenever both sides of the equality are defined.

2. The distributive law For three matrices A, B and C.

(i) A (B+C) = AB + AC

(ii) (A+B) C = AC + BC, whenever both sides of equality are defined.

3. The existence of multiplicative identity For every square matrix A, there
exist an identity matrix of same order such that IA = AI = A.

Now, we shall verify these properties by examples.

3.6  Symmetric and Skew Symmetric Matrices

Definition 4 A square matrix A = [a ] is said to be symmetric if A′ = A, that is,
ij  

[a ] = [a ] for all possible values of i and j.
ij ji

 3 2 3 
 

For example A =  2 −1.5 −1   is a symmetric matrix as A′ = A
 3 −1 1 

Definition 5 A square matrix A = [a ] is said to be skew symmetric matrix if
ij  

A′ = – A, that is a  = – a  for all possible values of i  and j. Now, if we put i = j, we
ji ij

have a  = – a . Therefore 2a  = 0 or a  = 0 for all i’s.

This means that all the diagonal elements of a skew symmetric matrix are zero.

For example, the matrix  

B =  −e 0 g   is a skew symmetric matrix as B′= –B

− f −g 0 

Now, we are going to prove some results of symmetric and skew-symmetric
matrices.

Theorem 1 For any square matrix A with real number entries, A + A′ is a symmetric
matrix and A – A′ is a skew symmetric matrix.
Proof Let B = A + A′, then

B′ = (A + A′)′
= A′ + (A′)′ (as (A + B)′ = A′ + B′)
= A′ + A (as (A′)′ = A)

= A + A′ (as A + B = B + A)

= B

Therefore B = A + A′ is a symmetric matrix

Now let C = A – A′
C′ = (A – A′)′ = A′ – (A′)′     (Why?)

= A′ – A    (Why?)

= – (A – A′) = – C

Therefore C = A – A′ is a skew symmetric matrix.

Theorem 2 Any square matrix can be expressed as the sum of a symmetric and a
skew symmetric matrix.

Proof Let A be a square matrix, then we can write

1 1
A = (A + A′) + (A − A′)

2 2

From the Theorem 1, we know that (A + A′) is a symmetric matrix and (A – A′) is

a skew symmetric matrix. Since for any matrix A, (kA)′ = kA′, it follows that (A + A′)

ANote

1. A rectangular matrix does not possess inverse matrix, since for products BA
and AB to be defined and to be equal, it is necessary that matrices A and B
should be square matrices of the same order.

2. If B is the inverse of A, then A is also the inverse of B.

Theorem 3 (Uniqueness of inverse) Inverse of a square matrix, if it exists, is unique.

Proof Let A = [a ] be a square matrix of order m. If possible, let B and C be two
ij

inverses of A. We shall show that B = C.

Since B is the inverse of A

AB = BA = I ... (1)

Since C is also the inverse of A

AC = CA = I ... (2)

Thus B = BI = B (AC) = (BA) C = IC = C

Theorem 4 If A and B are invertible matrices of the same order, then (AB)–1 = B–1 A–1.

Proof From the definition of inverse of a matrix, we have

(AB) (AB)–1 = 1

or A–1 (AB) (AB)–1 = A–1I (Pre multiplying both sides by A–1)

or (A–1A) B (AB)–1 = A–1 (Since A–1 I = A–1)

or IB (AB)–1 = A–1

or B (AB)–1 = A–1

or B–1 B (AB)–1 = B–1 A–1

or I (AB)–1 = B–1 A–1

Hence (AB)–1 = B–1 A–1

4.1  Introduction
In the previous chapter, we have studied about matrices
and algebra of matrices. We have also learnt that a system
of algebraic equations can be expressed in the form of
matrices. This means, a system of linear equations like

can be represented as     =   . Now, this

system of equations has a unique solution or not, is
determined by the number a  b  – a b . (Recall that if

1 2 2 1

≠ 1 P.S. Laplace

 or, a  b  – a b  ≠ 0,  then the system of linear

which determines uniqueness of solution is associated with the matrix A =  

a2 b2 
and is called the determinant of A or det A. Determinants have wide applications in
Engineering, Science, Economics, Social Science, etc.

In this chapter, we shall study determinants up to order three only with real entries.
Also, we will study various properties of determinants, minors, cofactors and applications
of determinants in finding the area of a triangle, adjoint and inverse of a square matrix,
consistency and inconsistency of system of linear equations and solution of linear
equations in two or three variables using inverse of a matrix.

4.2  Determinant
To every square matrix A = [a ] of order n, we can associate a number (real or

ij

complex) called determinant of the square matrix A, where a  = (i, j)th element of A.

This may be thought of as a function which associates each square matrix with a
unique number (real or complex). If M is the set of square matrices, K is the set of
numbers (real or complex) and f : M → K is defined by f (A) = k, where A ∈ M and
k ∈ K, then f (A) is called the determinant of A. It is also denoted by |A | or det A or ∆.

Remarks

(i) For matrix A, |A | is read as determinant of A and not modulus of A.
(ii) Only square matrices have determinants.

Hence, expanding a determinant along any row or column gives same value.

Remarks

(i) For easier calculations, we shall expand the determinant along that row or column

determinant in (1).

calculation.

4.4  Minors and Cofactors

In this section, we will learn to write the expansion of a determinant in compact form
using minors and cofactors.

Definition 1 Minor of an element a of a determinant is the determinant obtained by
ij 

deleting its ith row and jth column in which element a  lies. Minor of an element a  is
ij ij

denoted by M .

Remark Minor of an element of a determinant of order n(n ≥ 2) is a determinant of
order n – 1.

Definition 2 Cofactor of an element a , denoted by A  is defined by
ij ij

A  = (–1)i + j M , where M  is minor of a .

Example 9 Find minors and cofactors of all the elements of the determinant

A  = (–1)1 + 2  M  = (–1)3 (4) = – 4

To find inverse of a matrix A, i.e., A–1 we shall first define adjoint of a matrix.

ij n × n

the matrix [A ] , where A  is the cofactor of the element a . Adjoint of the matrix A
ij n × n ij ij

is denoted by adj A.

Similarly, we can show  (adj A) A = A  I

Hence A (adj A) = (adj A) A = A  I

Definition 4 A square matrix A is said to be singular if A  = 0.

1 2
For example, the determinant of matrix A =    is zero

4 8
Hence A is a singular matrix.

Definition 5 A square matrix A is said to be non-singular if A  ≠ 0

1 2 1 2
Let A =   . Then A =  = 4 – 6 = – 2 ≠ 0.

Hence A is a nonsingular matrix

We state the following theorems without proof.

Theorem 2 If A and B are nonsingular matrices of the same order, then AB and BA
are also nonsingular matrices of the same order.

Theorem 3 The determinant of the product of matrices is equal to product of their

respective determinants, that is, AB  = A  B , where A and B are square matrices of

the same order

Remark We know that (adj A) A = A  I =  0 A 0  , A ≠ 0

In general, if A is a square matrix of order n, then |adj (A) | = |A |n – 1.

Theorem 4 A square matrix A is invertible if and only if A is nonsingular matrix.

Proof Let A be invertible matrix of order n and I be the identity matrix of order n.

Then, there exists a square matrix B of order n such that AB = BA = I

Now AB = I.  So AB  = I     or   A  B  = 1    (since I =1, AB = A B )

This gives A ≠ 0. Hence A is nonsingular.

Conversely, let A be nonsingular. Then A  ≠ 0

Now A (adj A) = (adj A) A = A I (Theorem 1)

4.6  Applications of Determinants and Matrices
In this section, we shall discuss application of determinants and matrices for solving the
system of linear equations in two or three variables and for checking the consistency of
the system of linear equations.

Reprint 2025-26



 94 MATHEMATICS

Consistent system A system of equations is said to be consistent if its solution (one
or more) exists.

Inconsistent system A system of equations is said to be inconsistent if its solution
does not exist.

ANote In this chapter, we restrict ourselves to the system of linear equations

having unique solutions only.

4.6.1  Solution of system of linear equations using inverse of a matrix
Let us express the system of linear equations as matrix equations and solve them using
inverse of the coefficient matrix.

Consider the system of equations

a  x + b y + c  z =  d
1 1 1 1

a  x + b y + c  z = d
2 2 2 2

a  x + b y + c  z = d
3 3 3 3

a1 b1 c1  x d1 
 

Let A = a2 b2 c2 , X =  
y and B=  

    d2 
a3 b3 c 

3   z  d 
3 

Then, the system of equations can be written as, AX = B, i.e.,

a1 b1 c1   x d1 
     

 a2 b2 c2   y  = d2 
a 

3 b3 c3   z  d 
3 

Case I If A is a nonsingular matrix, then its inverse exists. Now

AX = B

or A–1 (AX) = A–1 B (premultiplying by A–1)

or (A–1A) X = A–1 B (by associative property)

or I X = A–1 B

or X = A–1 B
This matrix equation provides unique solution for the given system of equations as

inverse of a matrix is unique. This method of solving system of equations is known as
Matrix Method.

Case II If A is a singular matrix, then |A | = 0.

In this case, we calculate (adj A) B.

If (adj A) B ≠ O, (O being zero matrix), then solution does not exist and the
system of equations is called inconsistent.

Reprint 2025-26



DETERMINANTS     95

If (adj A) B = O, then system may be either consistent or inconsistent according
as the system have either infinitely many solutions or no solution.

Example 16 Solve the system of equations

2x + 5y = 1

3x + 2y = 7

Solution The system of equations can be written in the form AX = B, where

2 5 x 1
A =   ,X =   and B =  

3 2  y 7
Now, A  = –11 ≠ 0, Hence, A is nonsingular matrix and so has a unique solution.

1  2 −5
Note that A–1 = − 

1 − 
1 3 2 

Therefore X = A–1B = – 

i.e.    = −

 y   =  
11  11  −1

Hence x = 3, y = – 1

Example 17 Solve the following system of equations by matrix method.

3x – 2y + 3z = 8

2x + y – z = 1

4x – 3y + 2z = 4

Solution The system of equations can be written in the form AX = B, where

3 −2 3  x 8
A= 

2 1 − 
1 , X =    
 y and B= 1

4 −3 2   z  4
We see that

A  = 3 (2 – 3) + 2(4 + 4) + 3 (– 6 – 4) = – 17 ≠ 0

Hence, A is nonsingular and so its inverse exists. Now

A  = –1, A  = – 8, A  = –10
11 12 13

A  = –5, A  = – 6, A  = 1

Example 18 The sum of three numbers is 6. If we multiply third number by 3 and add
second number to it, we get 11. By adding first and third numbers, we get double of the

Solution Let first, second and third numbers be denoted by x, y and z, respectively.
Then, according to given conditions, we have

x + y + z = 6

y + 3z = 11

x + z = 2y  or x – 2y + z = 0

DETERMINANTS     103

Historical Note

The Chinese method of representing the coefficients of the unknowns of
several linear equations by using rods on a calculating board naturally led to the
discovery of simple method of elimination. The arrangement of rods was precisely
that of the numbers in a determinant. The Chinese, therefore, early developed the
idea of subtracting columns and rows as in simplification of a determinant
Mikami, China, pp 30, 93.

Seki Kowa, the greatest of the Japanese Mathematicians of seventeenth
century in his work ‘Kai Fukudai no Ho’ in 1683 showed that he had the idea of
determinants and of their expansion. But he used this device only in eliminating a
quantity from two equations and not directly in the solution of a set of simultaneous
linear equations. T. Hayashi, “The Fakudoi and Determinants in Japanese
Mathematics,” in the proc. of the Tokyo Math. Soc., V.

Vendermonde was the first to recognise determinants as independent functions.
He may be called the formal founder. Laplace (1772), gave general method of
expanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors. In 1773 Lagrange
treated determinants of the second and third orders and used them for purpose
other than the solution of equations. In 1801, Gauss used determinants in his
theory of numbers.

The next great contributor was Jacques - Philippe - Marie Binet, (1812) who
stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of m-columns and n-
rows, which for the special case of m = n reduces to the multiplication theorem.

Also on the same day, Cauchy (1812) presented one on the same subject. He
used the word ‘determinant’ in its present sense. He gave the proof of multiplication
theorem more satisfactory than Binet’s.

The greatest contributor to the theory was Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, after
this the word determinant received its final acceptance.

CONTINUITY AND
DIFFERENTIABILITY

vThe whole of science is nothing more than a refinement
of everyday thinking.” — ALBERT EINSTEIN v

5.1  Introduction

This chapter is essentially a continuation of our study of
differentiation of functions in Class XI. We had learnt to
differentiate certain functions like polynomial functions and
trigonometric functions. In this chapter, we introduce the
very important concepts of continuity, differentiability and
relations between them. We will also learn differentiation
of inverse trigonometric functions. Further, we introduce a
new class of functions called exponential and logarithmic
functions. These functions lead to powerful techniques of
differentiation. We illustrate certain geometrically obvious
conditions through differential calculus. In the process, we
will learn some fundamental theorems in this area.

Sir Issac Newton
5.2  Continuity (1642-1727)

We start the section with two informal examples to get a feel of continuity. Consider
the function

1, if x ≤ 0
f (x) = 

2, if x > 0

This function is of course defined at every
point of the real line. Graph of this function is
given in the Fig 5.1. One can deduce from the
graph that the value of the function at nearby
points on x-axis remain close to each other
except at x = 0. At the points near and to the
left of 0, i.e., at points like – 0.1, – 0.01, – 0.001,
the value of the function is 1. At the points near
and to the right of 0, i.e., at points like 0.1, 0.01, Fig 5.1

Reprint 2025-26



CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 105

0.001, the value of the function is 2. Using the language of left and right hand limits, we
may say that the left (respectively right) hand limit of f at 0 is 1 (respectively 2). In
particular the left and right hand limits do not coincide. We also observe that the value
of the function at x = 0 concides with the left hand limit. Note that when we try to draw
the graph, we cannot draw it in one stroke, i.e., without lifting pen from the plane of the
paper, we can not draw the graph of this function. In fact, we need to lift the pen when
we come to 0 from left. This is one instance of function being not continuous at x = 0.

Now, consider the function defined as

1, if x ≠ 0
f (x) = 

2, if x = 0

This function is also defined at every point. Left and the right hand limits at x = 0
are both equal to 1. But the value of the
function at x = 0 equals 2 which does not
coincide with the common value of the left
and right hand limits. Again, we note that we
cannot draw the graph of the function without
lifting the pen. This is yet another instance of
a function being not continuous at x = 0.

Naively, we may say that a function is
continuous at a fixed point if we can draw the
graph of the function around that point without

Fig 5.2
lifting the pen from the plane of the paper.

Mathematically, it may be phrased precisely as follows:

Definition 1 Suppose f is a real function on a subset of the real numbers and let  c be
a point in the domain of f. Then f is continuous at c if

lim f (x) = f (c)
x→c

More elaborately, if the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function
at x = c exist and equal to each other, then f is said to be continuous at x = c. Recall that
if the right hand and left hand limits at x = c coincide, then we say that the common
value is the limit of the function at x = c. Hence we may also rephrase  the definition of
continuity as follows: a function is continuous at x = c if the function is defined at
x = c and if the value of the function at x = c equals the limit of the function at
x = c. If f is not continuous at c, we say f is discontinuous at c and c is called a point
of discontinuity of f.

Example 1 Check the continuity of the function f given by f (x) = 2x + 3 at x = 1.

Solution First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 1 and its value is 5.
Then find the limit of the function at x = 1. Clearly

lim f (x) = lim (2x + 3) = 2(1) + 3 = 5
x→1 x→1

Thus lim f (x) = 5= f (1)
x→1

Hence, f is continuous at x = 1.

Example 2 Examine whether the function f given by f (x) = x2 is continuous at x = 0.

Solution First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 0 and its value is 0.
Then find the limit of the function at x = 0. Clearly

lim f (x) = lim x2 = 02 = 0
x→0 x→0

Thus lim f (x) = 0 = f (0)
x→0

Hence, f is continuous at x = 0.

Example 3 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by f(x) = | x | at x = 0.

Solution By definition

−x, if x < 0
f (x) = 

x, if x ≥ 0

Clearly the function is defined at 0 and f (0) = 0. Left hand limit of f at 0 is

lim f (x) = lim (–x) = 0
x→0− x→0−

Similarly, the right hand limit of f at 0 is

lim f (x) = lim x = 0
x→0+ x→0+

Thus, the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function coincide at
x = 0. Hence, f is continuous at x = 0.

Example 4 Show that the function f given by

x3 + 3, if x ≠ 0
f (x) = 

1, if x = 0

is not continuous at x = 0.

CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 107

Solution The function is defined at x = 0 and its value at x = 0 is 1. When x ≠ 0, the
function is given by a polynomial. Hence,

lim f (x) l m 3 03
 = i (x + 3) = + 3 = 3

x→0 x→0

Since the limit of f at x = 0 does not coincide with f (0), the function is not continuous
at x = 0. It may be noted that x = 0 is the only point of discontinuity for this function.

Example 5 Check the points where the constant function f (x) = k is continuous.

Solution The function is defined at all real numbers and by definition, its value at any
real number equals k. Let c be any real number. Then

lim f (x)  = lim k = k
x→c x→c

Since f (c) = k = lim ( ) f r a y r a  u
x→  f x  o  n  e l n mber c, the function f is continuous at

c

every real number.

Example 6 Prove that the identity function on real numbers given by f (x) = x is
continuous at every real number.

Solution The function is clearly defined at every point and f (c) = c for every real
number c. Also,

lim f (x)  = lim x = c
x→c x→c

Thus, lim f (x) = c = f (c) and hence the function is continuous at every real number.
x→c

Having defined continuity of a function at a given point, now we make a natural
extension of this definition to discuss continuity of a function.

Definition 2 A real function f is said to be continuous if it is continuous at every point
in the domain of f.

This definition requires a bit of elaboration. Suppose f is a function defined on a
closed interval [a, b], then for f to be continuous, it needs to be continuous at every
point in [a, b] including the end points a and b. Continuity of f at a means

lim f (x) = f (a)
x→a+

and continuity of f  at b means

lim f (x) = f(b)
x→b –

Observe that lim f (x)  and lim f (x) do not make sense. As a consequence
x→a− x→b+

of this definition, if f is defined only at one point, it is continuous there, i.e., if the
domain of f is a singleton, f is a continuous function.

Example 7 Is the function defined by f (x) = | x |, a continuous function?

Solution We may rewrite f as

−x, if x < 0
f (x) = 

x, if x ≥ 0

By Example 3, we know that f is continuous at x = 0.

Let c be a real number such that c < 0. Then f (c) = – c. Also

lim f (x)  = lim (−x) = – c           (Why?)
x→c x→c

Since lim f (x) = f (c) ,  f  is continuous at all negative real numbers.

also know that

f x  = lim (x x −1) =c + c −1

CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 109

We take this opportunity to explain the concept of infinity. This we do by analysing

1
the function f (x) =  near x = 0. To carry out this analysis we follow the usual trick of

x
finding the value of the function at real numbers close to 0. Essentially we are trying to
find the right hand limit of f at 0. We tabulate this in the following (Table 5.1).

Table 5.1

x 1 0.3 0.2 0.1 = 10–1 0.01 = 10–2 0.001 = 10–3 10–n

f (x) 1 3.333... 5 10 100 = 102 1000 = 103 10n

We observe that as x gets closer to 0 from the right, the value of f (x) shoots up
higher. This may be rephrased as: the value of f (x) may be made larger than any given
number by choosing a positive real number very close to 0. In symbols, we write

lim f (x) = + ∞
x→0+

(to be read as: the right hand limit of f (x) at 0 is plus infinity). We wish to emphasise
that + ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the right hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as
a real number).

Similarly, the left hand limit of f  at 0 may be found. The following table is self
explanatory.

Table 5.2

x – 1 – 0.3 – 0.2 – 10–1 – 10–2 – 10–3 – 10–n

f (x) – 1 – 3.333... – 5 – 10 – 102 – 103 – 10n

From the Table 5.2, we deduce that the
value of f (x) may be made smaller than any
given number by choosing a negative real
number very close to 0. In symbols,
we write

lim f (x) = − ∞
x→0−

(to be read as: the left hand limit of f (x) at 0 is
minus infinity). Again, we wish to emphasise
that – ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the
left hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as a real
number). The graph of the reciprocal function
given in Fig 5.3 is a geometric representation
of the above mentioned facts. Fig 5.3

Example 10 Discuss the continuity of the function f defined by

x + 2, if x ≤ 1

x − 2, if x > 1

Solution The function f is defined at all points of the real line.

Case 1 If c < 1, then f (c) = c + 2. Therefore, lim f (x) = lim(x + 2) = c + 2
x→c x→c

Thus, f is continuous at all real numbers less than 1.

Case 2 If c > 1, then f (c) = c – 2. Therefore,

lim f (x) = lim (x – 2) = c – 2 = f (c)
x→c x→c

Thus, f is continuous at all points x > 1.

Since the left and right hand limits of f at x = 1 Fig  5.4
do not coincide, f  is not continuous at x = 1. Hence
x = 1 is the only point of discontinuity of f. The graph of the function is given in Fig 5.4.

every real number and hence p is a continuous function.

CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 113

Case 1 Let c be a real number which is not equal to any integer. It is evident from the
graph that for all real numbers close to c the value of the function is equal to [c]; i.e.,

lim f (x) = lim [x] = [c] . Also f (c) = [c] and hence the function is continuous at all real
x→c x→c

numbers not equal to integers.

Case 2 Let c be an integer. Then we can find a sufficiently small real number
r > 0 such that [c – r] = c – 1 whereas [c + r] = c.

This, in terms of limits mean that

lim f (x) = c – 1, lim f (x) = c

Since these limits cannot be equal to each other for any c, the function is
discontinuous at every integral point.

5.2.1  Algebra of continuous functions

In the previous class, after having understood the concept of limits, we learnt some
algebra of limits. Analogously, now we will study some algebra of continuous functions.
Since continuity of a function at a point is entirely dictated by the limit of the function at
that point, it is reasonable to expect results analogous to the case of limits.

Theorem 1 Suppose f and g be two real functions continuous at a real number c.
Then

(1) f + g is continuous at x = c.

(2) f – g is continuous at x = c.

(3) f . g is continuous at x = c.

 f 
(4)   s c n i u u  t x

g  i  o t n o s a   = c, (provided g (c) ≠ 0).
 

Proof We are investigating continuity of (f + g) at x = c. Clearly it is defined at
x = c. We have

lim( f + g) (x)  = lim [ f (x) + g(x)] (by definition of f + g)
x→c x→c

= lim f (x) + lim g(x) (by the theorem on limits)
x→c x→c

= f (c) + g(c) (as f and g are continuous)
= (f + g) (c) (by definition of f + g)

Hence, f + g is continuous at x = c.

Proofs for the remaining parts are similar and left as an exercise to the reader.

Remarks

(i) As a special case of (3) above, if f is a constant function, i.e., f (x) = λ for some
real number λ, then the function (λ . g) defined by (λ . g) (x) = λ . g(x) is also
continuous. In particular if λ = – 1, the continuity of f implies continuity of – f.

(ii) As a special case of (4) above, if f is the constant function f (x) = λ, then the

The above theorem can be exploited to generate many continuous functions. They
also aid in deciding if certain functions are continuous or not. The following examples
illustrate this:

Solution Recall that every rational function f is given by

where p and q are polynomial functions. The domain of f is all real numbers except
points at which q is zero. Since polynomial functions are continuous (Example 14), f is
continuous by (4) of  Theorem 1.

Example 17 Discuss the continuity of sine function.

Solution To see this we use the following facts

lim sin x = 0

We have not proved it, but is intuitively clear from the graph of sin x near 0.

Now, observe that f (x) = sin x is defined for every real number. Let c be a real
number. Put x = c + h. If x → c we know that h → 0. Therefore

lim f (x)  = lim sin x

functions are continuous. Thus tan x being a quotient of two continuous functions is
continuous wherever it is defined.

An interesting fact is the behaviour of continuous functions with respect to
composition of functions. Recall that if f and g are two real functions, then

(f o g) (x) = f (g (x))

is defined whenever the range of g is a subset of domain of f. The following theorem
(stated without proof) captures the continuity of composite functions.

Theorem 2 Suppose f and g are real valued functions such that (f o g) is defined at c.
If g is continuous at c and if f is continuous at g (c), then (f o g) is continuous at c.

The following examples illustrate this theorem.

Example 19 Show that the function defined by f (x) = sin (x2) is a continuous function.

Solution Observe that the function is defined for every real number. The function
f may be thought of as a composition g o h of the two functions g and h, where
g (x) = sin x and h (x) = x2. Since both g and h are continuous functions, by Theorem 2,
it can be deduced that f is a continuous function.

Example 20 Show that the function f defined by

f (x) = |1 – x + | x | |,

where x is any real number, is a continuous function.

Solution Define g by g (x) = 1 – x + | x | and  h by h (x) = | x | for all real x. Then

(h o g) (x) = h (g (x))

= h (1– x + | x |)

= | 1– x + | x | | = f (x)

In Example 7, we have seen that h is a continuous function. Hence g being a sum
of a polynomial function and the modulus function is continuous. But then f  being a
composite of two continuous functions is continuous.

5.3.  Differentiability
Recall the following facts from previous class. We had defined the derivative of a real
function as follows:

Suppose f is a real function and c is a point in its domain. The derivative of f at c is
defined by

f (c + h) − f (c)
lim
h→0 h

CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 119

d
provided this limit exists. Derivative of f at c is denoted by f ′(c) or ( f (x)) |c . The

dx
function defined by

f (x + h) − f (x)
f ′(x) = lim

h→0 h

wherever the limit exists is defined to be the derivative of f. The derivative of f is

d dy
denoted by f ′ (x) or ( f (x)) or if y = f (x) by or y ′. The process of finding

dx dx
derivative of a function is called differentiation. We also use the phrase differentiate
f (x) with respect to x to mean find f ′(x).

The following rules were established as a part of algebra of derivatives:

(1) (u ± v)′ = u′ ± v′
(2) (uv)′ = u′v + uv′ (Leibnitz or product rule)

(3)  u ′ u′v − uv′
  = , wherever v ≠ 0 (Quotient rule).
 v  2

v

The following table gives a list of derivatives of certain standard functions:

Table 5.3

f (x) xn sin x cos x tan x

f ′(x) nxn – 1 cos x – sin x sec2 x

Whenever we defined derivative, we had put a caution provided the limit exists.
Now the natural question is; what if it doesn’t? The question is quite pertinent and so is

f (c + h) − f (c)
its answer. If  lim  does not exist, we say that f is not differentiable at c.

h→0 h

In other words, we say that a function f is differentiable at a point c in its domain if both

f (c + h) − f (c) f (c + h) − f (c)
lim  and lim  are finite and equal. A function is said
h→0– h h→0+ h

to be differentiable in an interval [a, b] if it is differentiable at every point of [a, b]. As
in case of continuity, at the end points a and b, we take the right hand limit and left hand
limit, which are nothing but left hand derivative and right hand derivative of the function
at a and b respectively. Similarly, a function is said to be differentiable in an interval
(a, b) if it is differentiable at every point of (a, b).

Theorem 3 If a function f is differentiable at a point c, then it is also continuous at that
point.

Proof Since f is differentiable at c, we have

f (x) − f (c)
lim = f ′(c)
x→c x − c

But for x ≠ c, we have

f (x) − f (c)
f (x) – f (c) = . (x − c)

x − c

 f (x) − f (c)
Therefore lim [ f (x) − 

f (c)]  = lim . ( )

x→c x→c x→c  x − c  x→c

or lim f (x)  = f (c)
x→c

Hence f is continuous at x = c.

Corollary 1 Every differentiable function is continuous.

We remark that the converse of the above statement is not true. Indeed we have
seen that the function defined by f (x) = | x | is a continuous function. Consider the left
hand limit

f (0 + h) − f (0) −h
lim = = −1
h→0– h h

The right hand limit

f (0 + h) − f (0) h
lim = =1
h→0+ h h

f (0 + h) − f (0)
Since the above left and right hand limits at 0 are not equal, lim

h→0 h
does not exist and hence f is not differentiable at 0. Thus f is not a differentiable
function.

5.3.1  Derivatives of composite functions

To study derivative of composite functions, we start with an illustrative example. Say,
we want to find the derivative of f, where

f (x) = (2x + 1)3

Reprint 2025-26



CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 121

One way is to expand (2x + 1)3 using binomial theorem and find the derivative as
a polynomial function as illustrated below.

d d

dx dx

d 3
= (8x +12x2 + 6x +1)

dx
= 24x2 + 24x + 6

= 6 (2x + 1)2

Now, observe that f (x) = (h o g) (x)

where g(x) = 2x + 1 and h(x) = x3. Put t = g(x) = 2x + 1. Then f(x) = h(t) = t3. Thus

df dh dt
 = 6 (2x + 1)2 = 3(2x + 1)2 . 2 = 3t2 . 2 = ⋅

dx dt dx

The advantage with such observation is that it simplifies the calculation in finding
the derivative of, say, (2x + 1)100. We may formalise this observation in the following
theorem called the chain rule.

Theorem 4 (Chain Rule) Let f be a real valued function which is a composite of two

functions u and v ; i.e., f = v o u. Suppose t = u (x) and if both  and  exist, we have

dx dt dx
We skip the proof of this theorem. Chain rule may be extended as follows. Suppose

f is a real valued function which is a composite of three functions u, v and w ; i.e.,

f = (w o u) o v. If t = v (x) and s = u (t), then

df d (wou) dt dw ds dt

provided all the derivatives in the statement exist. Reader is invited to formulate chain
rule for composite of more functions.

Example 21 Find the derivative of the function given by f (x) = sin (x2).

Solution Observe that the given function is a composite of two functions. Indeed, if
t = u(x) = x2 and v(t) = sin t, then

f (x) = (v o u) (x) = v(u(x)) = v(x2) = sin x2

Put t = u(x) = x2. Observe that = cos t  and = 2x  exist. Hence, by chain rule

5.3.2  Derivatives of implicit functions
Until now we have been differentiating various functions given in the form y = f (x).
But it is not necessary that functions are always expressed in this form. For example,
consider one of the following relationships between x and y:

x – y – π = 0

x + sin xy – y = 0
In the first case, we can solve for y and rewrite the relationship as y = x – π. In

the second case, it does not seem that there is an easy way to solve for y. Nevertheless,
there is no doubt about the dependence of y on x in either of the cases. When a
relationship between x and y is expressed in a way that it is easy to solve for y and
write y = f (x), we say that y is given as an explicit function of x. In the latter case it

functions.

We remark that inverse trigonometric functions are continuous functions, but we will
not prove this. Now we use chain rule to find derivatives of these functions.

i.e., x ∈ (– 1, 1).
To make this result a bit more attractive, we carry out the following manipulation.

cos2 y = 1 – (sin y)2 = 1 – (sin (sin–1 x))2 = 1 – x2

5.4  Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

Till now we have learnt some aspects of different classes of functions like polynomial
functions, rational functions and trigonometric functions. In this section, we shall
learn about a new class of (related) functions called exponential functions and logarithmic
functions. It needs to be emphasized that many statements made in this section are
motivational and precise proofs of these are well beyond the scope of this text.

The Fig 5.9 gives a sketch of y = f (x) = x, y = f (x) = x2, y = f (x) = x3 and y = f (x)
1 2 3 4

= x4. Observe that the curves get steeper as the power of x increases. Steeper the
curve, faster is the rate of growth. What this means is that for a fixed increment in the
value of x (> 1), the increment in the value of y = f (x) increases as n increases for n

n 

= 1, 2, 3, 4. It is conceivable that such a statement is true for all positive values of n,

Reprint 2025-26



126  MATHEMATICS

where f (x) = xn. Essentially, this means
n 

that the graph of y = f (x) leans more
n 

towards the y-axis as n increases. For
example, consider f (x) = x10 and f (x)

10 15

= x15. If x increases from 1 to 2, f
10

increases from 1 to 210 whereas f
15

increases from 1 to 215. Thus, for the same
increment in x, f  grow faster than f .

15 10

Upshot of the above discussion is that
the growth of polynomial functions is
dependent  on the degree of the polynomial
function – higher the degree, greater is
the growth. The next natural question is: Fig  5.9

Is there a function which grows faster than any polynomial function. The answer is in
affirmative and an example of such a function is

y  = f (x) = 10x.

Our claim is that this function f grows faster than f  (x) = xn for any positive integer n.
n

For example, we can prove that 10x grows faster than f (x) = x100. For large values
100 

of x like x = 103, note that f  (x) = (103)100 = 10300 whereas f (103) = 
100 10103

= 101000.

Clearly f (x) is much greater than f (x). It is not difficult to prove that for all
100 

x > 103, f (x) > f  (x). But we will not attempt to give a proof of this here. Similarly, by
100

choosing large values of x, one can verify that f (x) grows faster than f  (x) for any
n

positive integer n.

Definition 3 The exponential function with positive base b > 1 is the function

y = f (x) = bx

The graph of y = 10x is given in the Fig 5.9.

It is advised that the reader plots this graph for particular values of b like 2, 3 and 4.
Following are some of the salient features of the exponential functions:

(1) Domain of the exponential function is R, the set of all real numbers.

(2) Range of the exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers.

(3) The point (0, 1) is always on the graph of the exponential function (this is a
restatement of the fact that b0 = 1 for any real b > 1).

(4) Exponential function is ever increasing; i.e., as we move from left to right, the
graph rises above.

Reprint 2025-26



CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 127

(5) For very large negative values of x, the exponential function is very close to 0. In
other words, in the second quadrant, the graph approaches x-axis (but never
meets it).

Exponential function with base 10 is called the common exponential function. In
the Appendix A.1.4 of Class XI, it was observed that the sum of the series

1 1
1+ + + ...

1! 2!

is a number between 2 and 3 and is denoted by e. Using this e as the base we obtain an
extremely important exponential function y = ex.

This is called natural exponential function.

It would be interesting to know if the inverse of the exponential function exists and
has nice interpretation. This search motivates the following definition.

Definition 4 Let b > 1 be a real number. Then we say logarithm of a to base b is x if
bx = a.

Logarithm of a to base b is denoted by log  a. Thus log  a = x if bx = a.  Let us
b b

work with a few explicit examples to get a feel for this. We know 23 = 8. In terms of
logarithms, we may rewrite this as log  8 = 3. Similarly, 104 = 10000 is equivalent to

2

saying log  10000 = 4. Also, 625 = 54 = 252 is equivalent to saying log  625 = 4 or
10 5

log  625 = 2.
25

On a slightly more mature note, fixing a  base b > 1, we may look at logarithm as
a function from positive real numbers to all real numbers. This function, called the
logarithmic function, is defined by

log  : R+ → R
b

x → log  x = y   if by = x
b

As before if the base b = 10, we say it
is common logarithms and if b = e, then
we say it is natural logarithms. Often
natural logarithm is denoted by ln. In this
chapter, log x denotes the logarithm
function to base e, i.e., ln x will be written
as simply log x. The Fig 5.10 gives the plots
of logarithm function to base 2, e and 10.

Some of the important observations
about the logarithm function to any base
b > 1 are listed below:

 Fig 5.10

Reprint 2025-26



128  MATHEMATICS

(1) We cannot make a meaningful definition of logarithm of non-positive numbers
and hence the domain of log function is R+.

(2) The range of log function is the set of all real numbers.

(3) The point (1, 0) is always on the graph of the log function.

(4) The log function is ever increasing,
i.e., as we move from left to right
the graph rises above.

(5) For x very near to zero, the value
of log x can be made lesser than
any given real number. In other
words in the fourth quadrant the
graph approaches y-axis (but
never meets it).

(6) Fig 5.11 gives the plot of y = ex and
y = ln x. It is of interest to observe
that the two curves are the mirror  Fig 5.11

images of each other reflected in the line y = x.

Two  properties of ‘log’ functions are proved below:

(1) There is a standard change of base rule to obtain log  p in terms of log  p. Let
a b

log  p = α, log  p = β and log  a = γ. This means aα = p, bβ = p and bγ = a.
a b b

Substituting the third equation in the first one, we have

(bγ)α = bγα = p
Using this in the second equation, we get

bβ = p = bγα

β
which implies β = αγ or α = . But then

γ

logb p
log  p =

a logba

(2) Another interesting property of the log function is its effect on products. Let
log  pq = α. Then bα = pq. If log  p = β and log  q = γ, then bβ = p and bγ = q.

A particularly interesting and important consequence of this is when p = q. In
this case the above may be rewritten as

An easy generalisation of this (left as an exercise!) is

log  pn = n log p

for any positive integer n. In fact this is true for any real number n, but we will
not attempt to prove this. On the similar lines the reader is invited to verify

Example 25 Is it true that x = elog x for all real x?

Solution First, observe that the domain of log function is set of all positive real numbers.
So the above equation is not true for non-positive real numbers. Now, let y = elog x. If
y > 0, we may take logarithm which gives us log y = log (elog x) = log x . log e = log x. Thus
y = x. Hence x = elog x is true only for positive values of x.

One of the striking properties of the natural exponential function in differential
calculus is that it doesn’t change during the process of differentiation. This is captured
in the following theorem whose proof we skip.

5.5.  Logarithmic Differentiation

In this section, we will learn to differentiate certain special class of functions given in
the form

y = f (x) = [u(x)]v (x)

By taking logarithm (to base e) the above may be rewritten as

log y = v(x) log [u(x)]
Using chain rule we may differentiate this to get

1 dy 1
⋅ = v(x) ⋅  . u′(x) + v′(x) . log [u(x)]

y dx u(x)

which implies that

dy  v(x)
= 

y  ⋅u′(x) + v′(x) ⋅ log[u(x)]
dx u(x) 

 
The main point to be noted in this method is that f (x) and u(x) must always be

positive as otherwise their logarithms are not defined. This process of differentiation is
known as logarithms differentiation and is illustrated by the following examples:

5.6  Derivatives of Functions in Parametric Forms

Sometimes the relation between two variables is neither explicit nor implicit, but some
link of a third variable with each of the two variables, separately, establishes a relation
between the first two variables. In such a situation, we say that the relation between

them is expressed via a third variable. The third variable is called the parameter. More
precisely, a relation expressed between two variables x and y in the form

Summary

® A real valued function is continuous at a point in its domain if the limit of the
function at that point equals the value of the function at that point. A function
is continuous if it is continuous on the whole of its domain.

® Sum, difference, product and quotient of continuous functions are continuous.
i.e., if f and g are continuous functions, then

(f ± g) (x) = f (x) ± g (x) is continuous.

(f . g) (x) = f (x) . g (x) is continuous.

 f  f (x)
 (x) = w

g   ( herever g (x) ≠ 0) is continuous.
  g(x)

® Every differentiable function is continuous, but the converse is not true.

® Chain rule is rule to differentiate composites of functions. If f = v o u, t = u (x)

dt dv
and if both  and  exist then

df = dv ⋅ dt

® Logarithmic differentiation is a powerful technique to differentiate functions
of the form f (x) = [u (x)]v (x). Here both f (x) and u (x) need to be positive for
this technique to make sense.

6.1 Introduction

In Chapter 5, we have learnt how to find derivative of composite functions, inverse
trigonometric functions, implicit functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions.
In this chapter, we will study applications of the derivative in various disciplines, e.g., in
engineering, science, social science, and many  other fields. For instance, we will learn
how the derivative can be used (i) to determine rate of change of quantities, (ii) to find
the equations of tangent and normal to a curve at a point, (iii) to find turning points on
the graph of a function which in turn will help us to locate points at which largest or
smallest value (locally) of a function occurs. We will also use derivative to find intervals
on which a function is increasing or decreasing. Finally, we use the derivative to find
approximate value of certain quantities.

6.2 Rate of Change of Quantities

ds
Recall that by the derivative , we mean the rate of change of distance s with

dt
respect to the time t. In a similar fashion, whenever one quantity y varies with another

quantity x, satisfying some rule y = f (x) , then  (or f ′(x)) represents the rate of

dx

dy 
change of y with respect to x and  dx   (or f ′(x )) represents the  rate of change

x= 0
x0

of y with respect to x at x = x0 .

Further, if two variables x and y are varying with respect to another variable t, i.e.,

if x = f (t) and y = g(t) , then by Chain Rule

Thus, the rate of change of y with respect to x can be calculated using the rate of
change of y and that of x both with respect to t.

Let us consider some examples.

Example 1 Find the rate of change of the area of a circle per second with respect to
its radius r when r = 5 cm.

Solution The area A of a circle with radius r is given by A = πr2. Therefore, the rate

of change of the area A with respect to its radius r is given by = (πr2 ) = 2πr .

When r = 5 cm, =10π . Thus, the area of the circle is changing at the rate of

Example 2 The volume of a cube is increasing at a rate of 9 cubic centimetres per
second. How fast is the surface area increasing when the length of an edge is 10
centimetres ?

Solution Let x be the length of a side, V be the volume and S be the surface area of
the cube. Then, V = x3 and S = 6x2, where x is a function of time t.

Example 3 A stone is dropped into a quiet lake and waves move in circles at a speed
of 4cm per second. At the instant, when the radius of the circular wave is 10 cm, how
fast is the enclosed area increasing?

Solution The area A of a circle with radius r is given by A = πr2. Therefore, the rate
of change of area A with respect to time t is

the width y is increasing at the rate of 2cm/minute. When x =10cm and y = 6cm, find
the rates of change of (a) the perimeter and (b) the area of the rectangle.

Example 5 The total cost C(x) in Rupees, associated with the production of x units of
an item is given by

C(x) = 0.005 x3 – 0.02 x2 + 30x + 5000
Find the marginal cost when 3 units are produced, where by marginal cost we

mean the instantaneous rate of change of total cost at any level of output.

Solution Since marginal cost is the rate of change of total cost with respect to the
output, we have

When x = 3, MC = 0.015(3 ) − 0.04(3) + 30

Solution Since marginal revenue is the rate of change of total revenue with respect to
the number of units sold, we have

When x = 5, MR = 6(5) + 36 = 66

6.3  Increasing and Decreasing Functions

In this section, we will use differentiation to find out whether a function is increasing or
decreasing or none.

Consider the function f given by f (x) = x2, x Î R. The graph of this function is a
parabola  as given in Fig 6.1.

as we move from left to right, the as we move from left to right, the
height of the graph decreases height of the graph increases

Fig 6.1

First consider the graph (Fig 6.1) to the right of the origin. Observe that as we
move from left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously increases.
For this reason, the function is said to be increasing for the real numbers x > 0.

Now consider the graph to the left of the origin and observe here that as we move
from left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously decreases.
Consequently, the function is said to be decreasing for the real numbers  x < 0.

We shall now give the following analytical definitions for a function which is
increasing or decreasing on an interval.

Definition 1 Let I be an interval contained in the domain of a real valued function f.
Then f is said to be

(i) increasing on I if x  < x  in I Þ f (x ) < f (x ) for all x , x  Î I.
1 2 1 2 1 2

(ii) decreasing on I, if x  < x  in I Þ f (x ) > f (x ) for all x , x  Î I.

(i) (ii) Decreasing function

(iii)

We shall now define when a function is increasing or decreasing at a point.

Definition 2 Let x  be a point in the domain of definition of a real valued function  f.
0

Then  f  is said to be increasing, decreasing at x  if  there exists an open interval I
0

containing x  such that f is increasing, decreasing, respectively, in I.
0

Let us clarify this definition for the case of increasing function.

Example 7 Show that the function given by f (x) = 7x – 3 is increasing on R.

Solution Let x  and x  be any two numbers in R. Then
1 2

x  < x  Þ 7x  < 7x  Þ 7x  – 3 < 7x  – 3 Þ f (x ) < f (x )
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2

Thus, by Definition 1, it follows that f is strictly increasing on R.

We shall now give the first derivative test for increasing and decreasing functions.

The proof of this test requires the Mean Value Theorem studied in Chapter 5.

Theorem 1 Let  f  be continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval
(a,b). Then

(a) f  is increasing in [a,b] if f ¢(x) > 0 for each x Î (a, b)

(b) f  is decreasing in [a,b] if f ¢(x) < 0 for each x Î (a, b)

(c) f  is a constant function in [a,b] if f ¢(x) = 0 for each x Î (a, b)

Reprint 2025-26



154  MATHEMATICS

Proof (a) Let x , x  Î [a, b] be such that x  < x .
1 2 1 2

Then, by Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 8 in Chapter 5), there exists a point c

between x  and x  such that
1 2

f (x ) – f (x ) = f ¢(c) (x  – x )
2 1 2 1

i.e. f (x ) – f (x ) > 0 (as f ¢(c) > 0 (given))
2 1

i.e. f (x ) > f (x )
2 1

Thus, we have

x1  x2  f (x1)  f (x2 ), for all x1, x2 [a,b]

Hence, f  is an increasing function in [a,b].

The proofs of part (b) and (c) are similar. It is left as an exercise to the reader.

Remarks

There is a more generalised theorem, which states that if f¢(x) > 0 for x in an interval
excluding the end points and f is continuous in the interval, then f is increasing. Similarly,

if f¢(x) < 0 for x in an interval excluding the end points and f is continuous in the
interval, then f is decreasing.

Example 8 Show that the function  f  given by

f (x) = x3 – 3x2 + 4x, x Î R

is increasing on R.

Solution Note that

f ¢(x) = 3x2 – 6x + 4

= 3(x2 – 2x + 1) + 1

= 3(x – 1)2 + 1 > 0, in every interval of R

Therefore, the function  f is increasing on R.

Example 9 Prove that the function given by f (x) = cos x is

(a) decreasing in (0, p)

(b) increasing in (p, 2p), and

(c) neither increasing nor decreasing in (0, 2p).

Solution Note that f ′(x) = – sin x

(a) Since for each x ∈ (0, π), sin x > 0, we have f ′(x) < 0 and so f is decreasing in

(0, π).

(b) Since for each x ∈ (π, 2π), sin x < 0, we have f ′(x) > 0 and so f is increasing in

(π, 2π).

(c) Clearly by (a) and (b) above, f is neither increasing nor decreasing in (0, 2π).

Example 10 Find the intervals in which the function f given by f (x) = x2 – 4x + 6 is

(a) increasing (b)  decreasing

Solution We have

f (x) = x2 – 4x + 6
Fig 6.3

or f ′(x) = 2x – 4

Therefore, f ′(x) = 0 gives x = 2. Now the point x = 2 divides the real line into two

disjoint intervals namely, (– ∞, 2) and (2, ∞) (Fig 6.3). In the interval (– ∞, 2), f ′(x) = 2x

– 4 < 0.

Therefore, f is decreasing in this interval. Also, in the interval (2,∞) , f ′(x) > 0

and so the function  f  is increasing in this interval.

Example 11 Find the intervals in which the function f given by f (x) = 4x3 – 6x2 – 72x

+ 30 is (a) increasing (b) decreasing.

Solution We have

f (x) = 4x3 – 6x2 – 72x + 30

or f ′(x) = 12x2 – 12x – 72

= 12(x2 – x – 6)

= 12(x – 3) (x + 2)

Therefore, f ′(x) = 0 gives x = – 2, 3. The

points x = – 2 and  x = 3 divides the real line into

three disjoint intervals, namely, (– ∞, – 2), (– 2, 3) Fig 6.4

6.4  Maxima and Minima

In this section, we will use the concept of derivatives to calculate the maximum or
minimum values of  various functions. In fact, we will find the ‘turning points’ of the
graph of a function and thus find points at which the graph reaches its highest (or

lowest) locally. The knowledge of such points is very useful in sketching the graph of
a given function. Further, we will also find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum
of a function that are necessary for the solution of many applied problems.

Let us consider the following problems that arise in day to day life.

(i) The profit from a grove of orange trees is given by P(x) = ax + bx2, where a,b
are constants and x is the number of orange trees per acre. How many trees per
acre will maximise the profit?

(ii) A ball, thrown into the air from a building 60 metres high, travels along a path

x2

given by h(x) = 60 + x − , where x is the horizontal distance from the building
60

and h(x) is the height of the ball . What is the maximum height the ball will
reach?

(iii) An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the path given by the curve
f (x) = x2 + 7. A soldier, placed at the point (1, 2), wants to shoot the helicopter
when it is nearest to him. What is the nearest distance?

In each of the above problem, there is something common, i.e., we wish to find out
the maximum or minimum values of the given functions. In order to tackle such problems,
we first formally define maximum or minimum values of a function, points of local
maxima and minima and test for determining such points.

Definition 3 Let f be a function defined on an interval I. Then

(a)  f is said to have a maximum value in I, if there exists a point c in I such that

f (c) > f (x) , for all x ∈ I.

The number f (c) is called the maximum value of f in I and the point c is called a
point of maximum value of f in I.

(b)  f  is said to have a minimum value in I, if there exists a point c in I such that
f (c) < f (x), for all x ∈ I.

The number f (c), in this case, is called the minimum value of f in I and the point
c, in this case, is called a point of minimum value of  f  in I.

(c) f is said to have an extreme value in I if there exists a point c in I such that
f (c) is either a maximum value or a minimum value of f  in I.

The number  f (c), in this case, is called an extreme value of  f  in I and the point c
is called an extreme point.

Remark In Fig 6.7(a), (b) and (c), we have exhibited that graphs of certain particular
functions  help us to find maximum value and minimum value at a point. Infact, through
graphs, we can even find maximum/minimum value of a function at a point at which it
is not even differentiable (Example 15).

Example 14 Find the maximum and the minimum values, if
any, of the function f  given by

f (x) = x2, x ∈ R.

Solution From the graph of the given function (Fig 6.8), we
have  f (x) = 0 if x = 0. Also

f (x) ≥ 0, for all x ∈ R.

Therefore, the minimum value of  f  is 0 and the point of
minimum value of f is x = 0. Further, it may be observed
from the graph of the function that f  has no maximum value
and hence no point of maximum value of  f  in R.

ANote  If we restrict the domain of  f to [– 2, 1] only,

then f will have maximum value(– 2)2 = 4 at x = – 2.

Example 15 Find the maximum and minimum values
of  f , if any, of the function given by f (x) = |x |, x ∈ R.

Solution From the graph of the given function
(Fig 6.9) , note that

f (x) ≥ 0, for all x ∈ R and  f (x) = 0  if  x = 0.

Therefore, the function f has a minimum value 0
and the point of minimum value of f is x = 0. Also, the
graph clearly shows that f has no maximum value in R
and hence no point of maximum value in R. Fig 6.9

ANote

(i) If we restrict the domain of f to [– 2, 1] only, then f will have maximum value

(ii) One may note that the function f in Example 27 is not differentiable at
x = 0.

Example 16 Find the maximum and the minimum values, if any, of the function
given by

f (x) = x, x ∈ (0, 1).

Solution The given function is an increasing (strictly) function in the given interval
(0, 1). From the graph (Fig 6.10) of the function f , it
seems that, it should have the minimum value at a
point closest to 0 on its right and the maximum value
at a point closest to 1 on its left. Are such points
available? Of course, not. It is not possible to locate
such points. Infact, if a point x  is closest to 0, then

0

x0
we find < x0  for all x (

2 0 ∈ 0,1) . Also, if x  is closest
1

x1 +1
to 1, then > x1  for all x1 ∈(0,1) .

2
Fig 6.10

Therefore, the given function has neither the
maximum value nor the minimum value in the interval (0,1).

Remark The reader may observe that in Example 16, if we include the points 0 and 1
in the domain of  f , i.e., if we extend the domain of  f  to [0,1], then the function  f  has
minimum value 0 at x = 0 and maximum value 1 at x = 1. Infact, we have the following
results (The proof of these results are beyond the scope of the present text)

Every monotonic function assumes its maximum/minimum value at the end
points of the domain of definition of the function.

A more general result is

Every continuous function on a closed interval has a maximum and a minimum
value.

ANote  By a monotonic function f  in an interval I, we mean that f  is either
increasing in I or decreasing in I.

Maximum and minimum values of a function defined on a closed interval will be
discussed later in this section.

Let us now examine the graph of a function as shown in Fig 6.11. Observe that at
points A, B, C and D on the graph, the function changes its nature from decreasing to
increasing or vice-versa. These points may be called turning points of the given
function. Further, observe that at turning points, the graph has either a little hill or a little
valley. Roughly speaking, the function has minimum value in some neighbourhood
(interval) of each of the points A and C which are at the bottom of their respective

Reprint 2025-26



APPLICATION OF DERIVATIVES 163

Fig 6.11

valleys. Similarly, the function has maximum value in some neighbourhood of points B
and D which are at the top of their respective hills. For this reason, the points A and C
may be regarded as points of local minimum value (or relative minimum value) and
points B and D may be regarded as points of local maximum value (or relative maximum
value) for the function. The local maximum value and local minimum value of the
function are referred to as local maxima and local minima, respectively, of the function.

We now formally give the following definition

Definition 4 Let  f  be a real valued function and let c be an interior point in the domain
of f. Then

(a) c is called a point of local maxima if there is an h > 0 such that

f (c) ≥ f (x), for all x in (c – h, c + h), x ≠ c

The value f (c) is called the local maximum value of f.

(b) c is called a point of local minima if there is an h > 0 such that

f (c) ≤ f (x), for all  x in (c – h, c + h)

The value f (c) is called the local minimum value of f .

Geometrically, the above definition states that if  x = c is a point of local maxima of  f,
then the graph of f around c will be as shown in Fig 6.12(a). Note that the function f  is
increasing (i.e., f ′(x) > 0) in the interval (c – h, c) and decreasing (i.e., f ′(x) < 0) in the
interval (c, c + h).

This suggests that f ′(c) must be zero.

Fig 6.12

Reprint 2025-26



164  MATHEMATICS

Similarly, if c is a point of local minima of f , then the graph of f around c will be as
shown in Fig 6.14(b). Here f  is decreasing (i.e., f ′(x) < 0) in the interval (c – h, c) and
increasing (i.e., f ′(x) > 0) in the interval (c, c + h). This again suggest that f ′(c) must
be zero.

The above discussion lead us to the following theorem (without proof).

Theorem 2 Let  f  be a function defined on an open interval I. Suppose c ∈ I be  any
point. If f  has a local maxima or a local minima at x = c, then either f ′(c) = 0 or f  is not
differentiable at c.

Remark The converse of above theorem need not
be true, that is, a point at which the derivative vanishes
need not be a point of local maxima or local minima.
For example, if f (x) = x3, then f ′(x) = 3x2 and so
f ′(0) = 0. But 0 is neither a point of local maxima nor
a point of local minima (Fig 6.13).

ANote   A point c in the domain of a function f at

which either f ′(c) = 0 or f is not differentiable is
called a critical point of f. Note that if f is continuous
at c and f ′(c) = 0, then there exists an h > 0 such
that f is differentiable in the interval
(c – h, c + h). Fig 6.13

We shall now give a working rule for finding points of local maxima or points of
local minima using only the first order derivatives.

Theorem 3 (First Derivative Test) Let f be a function defined on an open interval I.
Let f be continuous at a critical point c in I. Then

(i) If f ′(x) changes sign from positive to negative as x increases through c, i.e., if
f ′(x) > 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of c, and f ′(x) < 0 at
every point sufficiently close to and to the right of c, then c is a point of local
maxima.

(ii) If f ′(x) changes sign from negative to positive as x increases through c, i.e., if
f ′(x) < 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of c, and f ′(x) > 0 at
every point sufficiently close to and to the right of c, then c is a point of local
minima.

(iii) If f ′(x) does not change sign as x increases through c, then c is neither a point of
local maxima nor a point of local minima. Infact, such a point is called point of
inflection (Fig 6.13).

ANote  If c is a point of local maxima of f , then f (c) is a local maximum value of

f. Similarly, if c is a point of local minima of f , then  f(c) is a local minimum value of f.

Figures 6.13 and 6.14, geometrically explain Theorem 3.

Fig 6.14

Example 17 Find all points of local maxima and local minima of the function f
given by

f (x) = x3 – 3x + 3.

Solution We have

f (x) = x3 – 3x + 3

or f ′(x) = 3x2 – 3 = 3(x – 1) (x + 1)

or f ′(x) = 0 at x = 1 and x = – 1

Thus, x = ± 1 are the only critical points which could possibly be the points of local
maxima and/or local minima of f . Let us first examine the point x = 1.

Note that for values close to 1 and to the right of 1, f ′(x) > 0 and  for values close
to 1 and to the left of 1, f ′(x) < 0. Therefore, by first derivative test, x  = 1 is a point
of local minima and local minimum value is f (1) = 1. In the case of x = –1, note that
f ′(x) > 0, for values close to and to the left of –1 and f ′(x) < 0, for values close to and
to the right of – 1. Therefore, by first derivative test, x = – 1 is a point of local maxima
and local maximum value is  f (–1) = 5.

Example 18 Find all the points of local maxima and local minima of the function f
given by

f (x) = 2x3 – 6x2 + 6x +5.
Solution We have

f (x) = 2x3 – 6x2 + 6x + 5

or f ′(x) = 6x2 – 12x + 6 = 6 (x – 1)2

or f ′(x) = 0    at   x = 1

Thus, x = 1 is the only critical point of  f . We shall now examine this point for local
maxima and/or local minima of f. Observe that f ′(x) ≥ 0, for all x ∈ R and in particular
f ′(x) > 0, for values close to 1 and to the left and to the right of 1. Therefore, by first
derivative test, the point x = 1 is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local
minima. Hence x = 1 is a point of inflexion.

Remark One may note that since f ′(x), in Example 30, never changes its sign on R,
graph of f has no turning points and hence no point of local maxima or local minima.

We shall now give another test to examine local maxima and local minima of a
given function. This test is often easier to apply than the first derivative test.

Theorem 4 (Second Derivative Test) Let  f  be a function defined on an interval I
and c ∈ I. Let f  be twice differentiable at c. Then

(i) x = c is a point of local maxima if f ′(c) = 0 and f ″(c) < 0

The value f (c) is local maximum value of  f .

(ii) x = c is a point of local minima if f ′(c) = 0  and f ″(c) > 0

In this case, f (c) is local minimum value of  f .

(iii) The test fails if f ′(c) = 0 and f ″(c) = 0.

In this case, we go back to the first derivative test and find whether c is a point of
local maxima, local minima or a point of inflexion.

ANote  As f is twice differentiable at c, we mean

second order derivative of f exists at c.

Example 19 Find local minimum value of the function f
given by  f (x) = 3 + |x |, x ∈ R.

Solution Note that the given function is not differentiable
at x  = 0. So, second derivative test fails. Let us try first
derivative test. Note that 0 is a critical point of f . Now to

APPLICATION OF DERIVATIVES 167

the right of 0, f (x) = 3 + x and so  f ′(x) = 1 > 0. Therefore, by first derivative test, x =
0 is a point of  local minima of  f  and local minimum value of  f  is f (0) = 3.

Example 20 Find local maximum and local minimum values of the function  f  given by

f (x) = 3x4 + 4x3 – 12x2 + 12
Solution We have

f (x) = 3x4 + 4x3 – 12x2 + 12

or f ′(x) = 12x3 + 12x2 – 24x = 12x (x – 1) (x + 2)

or f ′(x) = 0 at x = 0, x = 1 and x = – 2.

Now f ″(x) = 36x2 + 24x – 24 = 12 (3x2 + 2x – 2)

 f ′′(0) = −24 < 0

 f ′′(1) = 36 > 0

or
 f ′′(−2) = 72 > 0

Therefore, by second derivative test, x  = 0 is a point of local maxima and local
maximum value of f at x = 0 is f (0) = 12 while x = 1 and x = – 2 are the points of local
minima and local minimum values of f at x = – 1 and – 2 are f (1) = 7 and f (–2) = –20,
respectively.

Example 21 Find all the points of local maxima and local minima of the function f
given by

f (x) = 2x3 – 6x2 + 6x +5.

Solution We have

f (x) = 2x3 – 6x2 + 6x +5

 f ′(x) = 6x2 −12x + 6 = 6(x −1)2

or 
 f ′′(x) =12(x −1)

Now f ′(x) = 0 gives x =1. Also f ″(1) = 0. Therefore, the second derivative test
fails in this case. So, we shall go back to the first derivative test.

We have already seen (Example 18) that, using first derivative test, x =1 is neither
a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima and so it is a point of inflexion.

Example 24 Let AP and BQ be two vertical poles at
points A and B, respectively. If AP = 16 m, BQ = 22 m

and AB = 20 m, then find the distance of a point R on
AB from the point A such that RP2 + RQ2 is minimum.

Solution Let R be a point on AB such that AR = x  m.

Then RB = (20 – x) m (as AB = 20 m). From Fig 6.16,
we have

RP2 = AR2 + AP2

and RQ2 = RB2 + BQ2 Fig 6.16

Therefore RP2 + RQ2 = AR2 + AP2 + RB2 + BQ2

= x2 + (16)2 + (20 – x)2 + (22)2

= 2x2 – 40x + 1140

Let S ≡ S(x) = RP2 + RQ2 = 2x2 – 40x + 1140.

Therefore S′(x) = 4x – 40.
Now S′(x) = 0 gives x = 10. Also S″(x) = 4 > 0, for all x and so S″(10) > 0.

Therefore, by second derivative test, x = 10 is the point of local minima of S. Thus, the
distance of R from A on AB is AR = x =10 m.

6.4.1  Maximum and Minimum Values of a Function in a Closed Interval

Let us consider a function  f  given by

f (x) = x + 2, x ∈ (0, 1)

Observe that the function is continuous on (0, 1) and neither has a maximum value
nor has a minimum value. Further, we may note that the function even has neither a
local maximum value nor a local minimum value.

However, if we extend the domain of  f  to the closed interval [0, 1], then f still may
not have a local maximum (minimum) values but it certainly does have maximum value
3 = f (1) and minimum value 2 =  f (0). The maximum value 3 of f at x = 1 is called
absolute maximum value (global maximum or greatest value) of f on the interval
[0, 1]. Similarly, the minimum value 2 of f  at x  = 0 is called the absolute minimum
value (global minimum or least value) of f on [0, 1].

Consider the graph given in Fig 6.19 of a continuous function defined on a closed
interval [a, d]. Observe that the function f has a local minima at x = b and local

minimum value is f (b). The function also has a local maxima at x = c and local maximum
value is f (c).

Also from the graph, it is evident that f has  absolute maximum value f (a) and
absolute minimum value f (d). Further note that the absolute maximum (minimum)
value of f is different from local maximum (minimum) value of f .

We will now state two results (without proof) regarding absolute maximum and
absolute minimum values of a function on a closed interval I.

Theorem 5 Let f  be a continuous function on an interval I = [a, b]. Then f has the
absolute maximum value and f attains it at least once in I. Also, f has the absolute
minimum value and attains it at least once in I.

Theorem 6 Let f be a differentiable function on a closed interval I and let c be any
interior point of I. Then

(i) f ′(c) = 0 if  f attains its absolute maximum value at c.

(ii) f ′(c) = 0 if  f attains its absolute minimum value at c.

In view of the above results, we have the following working rule for finding absolute
maximum and/or absolute minimum values of a function in a given closed interval
[a, b].

Working Rule

Step 1: Find all critical points of  f  in the interval, i.e., find points x where either

f ′(x) = 0  or f  is not differentiable.

Step 2: Take the end points of the interval.

Step 3: At all these points (listed in Step 1 and 2), calculate the values of  f .

Step 4: Identify the maximum and minimum values of  f  out of the values calculated in
Step 3. This maximum value will be the absolute maximum (greatest) value of
f  and the minimum value will be the absolute minimum (least) value of  f .

Example 27 Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a function f given by

f (x) = 2x3 – 15x2 + 36x +1 on the interval [1, 5].

Solution We have

f (x) = 2x3 – 15x2 + 36x + 1

or f ′(x) = 6x2 – 30x + 36 = 6 (x – 3) (x – 2)

Note that f ′(x) = 0 gives  x = 2 and x = 3.

We shall now evaluate the value of f at these points and at the end points of the
interval [1, 5], i.e., at x = 1, x = 2, x = 3 and at x = 5. So

f (1) = 2(13) – 15(12) + 36 (1) + 1 = 24

f (2) = 2(23) – 15(22) + 36 (2) + 1 = 29

f (3) = 2(33) – 15(32) + 36 (3) + 1 = 28

f (5) = 2(53) – 15(52) + 36 (5) + 1 = 56

Thus, we conclude that absolute maximum value of f on [1, 5] is 56, occurring at
x =5, and absolute  minimum value of f on [1, 5] is 24 which occurs at x = 1.

Example 29 An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the curve given by
y = x2 + 7. A soldier, placed at (3, 7), wants to shoot down the helicopter when it is
nearest to him. Find the nearest distance.

Solution For each value of x, the helicopter’s position is at point (x, x2 + 7).
Therefore, the distance between the helicopter and the soldier placed at (3,7) is

(x − 3)2 + (x2 + 7 − 7)2 , i.e., (x − 3)2 + x4 .

Let f (x) = (x – 3)2 + x4

or f ′(x) = 2(x – 3) + 4x3 = 2 (x – 1) (2x2 + 2x + 3)

Thus, f ′(x) = 0 gives x = 1 or 2x2 + 2x + 3 = 0 for which there are  no real roots.
Also, there are no end points of the interval to be added to the set for which f ′ is zero,
i.e., there is only one point, namely, x = 1. The value of f at this point is given by
f (1) = (1 – 3)2 + (1)4  = 5. Thus, the distance between the solider and the helicopter is

f (1) = 5 .

Note that 5  is either a maximum value or a minimum value. Since

f (0)  = (0 − 3)2 + (0)4 = 3 > 5 ,

it follows that 5  is the minimum value of  f (x) . Hence, 5  is the minimum

distance between the soldier and the helicopter.

Now f ′(x) = 0 gives x = 1, x = – 2, or x = 3. The
points x = 1, – 2, and 3 divide the real line into four
disjoint intervals namely, (– ∞, – 2), (– 2, 1), (1, 3) Fig 6.22
and (3, ∞) (Fig 6.22).

Consider the interval (– ∞, – 2), i.e., when – ∞ < x < – 2.

In this case, we have x – 1 < 0, x + 2 < 0 and x – 3 < 0.

(In particular, observe that for x = –3, f ′(x) = (x – 1) (x + 2) (x – 3) = (– 4) (– 1)
(– 6) < 0)

Therefore, f ′(x) < 0 when – ∞ < x < – 2.

Thus, the function f is decreasing in (– ∞, – 2).

Consider the interval (– 2, 1), i.e., when  – 2 < x < 1.

In this case, we have x – 1 < 0, x + 2 > 0 and x – 3 < 0

(In particular, observe that for x = 0, f ′(x) = (x – 1) (x + 2) (x – 3) = (–1) (2) (–3)

So f ′(x) > 0 when – 2 < x < 1.

Thus, f is increasing in (– 2, 1).

Now consider the interval (1, 3), i.e., when 1 < x < 3. In this case, we have
x – 1 > 0, x  + 2 > 0 and x – 3 < 0.

So, f ′(x) < 0 when 1 < x < 3.

Thus,  f is decreasing in (1, 3).

Finally, consider the interval (3, ∞), i.e., when  x > 3. In this case, we have x – 1 > 0,
x + 2 > 0 and  x – 3 > 0. So f ′(x) > 0 when x > 3.

Thus,  f  is increasing in the interval (3, ∞).

® If a quantity y varies with another quantity x, satisfying some rule y = f (x) ,

dy
then  (or f ′(x) ) represents the rate of change of y with respect to x and

dx

dy  
dx    (or f ′(x )  

x= 0 ) represents the  rate of change of y with respect to x at
x0

x = x0 .

® If two variables x and y are varying with respect to another variable t, i.e., if

x = f (t) and y = g(t) , then by Chain Rule

dy = dy dx dx

® A function  f  is said to be

(a) increasing on an interval (a, b) if
x < x  in (a, b) ⇒ f (x ) < f (x ) for all x , x  ∈ (a, b).

Alternatively, if f ′(x) ≥ 0 for each x in (a, b)

(b) decreasing on (a,b) if

x < x  in (a, b) ⇒ f (x ) > f (x ) for all x , x  ∈ (a, b).

(c) constant in (a, b), if f (x) = c for all x ∈ (a, b), where c is a constant.

® A point c in the domain of a function f at which either f ′(c) = 0 or f is not
differentiable is called a critical point of f.

® First Derivative Test Let f  be a function defined on an open interval I. Let
f   be continuous at a critical point c in I. Then

 (i) If f ′(x) changes sign from positive to negative as x increases through c,
i.e., if f ′(x) > 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of c,
and f ′(x) < 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the right of c,
then c is a point of local maxima.

(ii) If f ′(x) changes sign from negative to positive as x increases through c,
i.e., if f ′(x) < 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of c,
and f ′(x) > 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the right of c,
then c is a point of local minima.

(iii) If f ′(x) does not change sign as x increases through c, then c is neither
a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima. Infact, such a point
is called point of inflexion.

® Second Derivative Test Let f be a function defined on an interval I and
c ∈ I. Let f  be twice differentiable at c. Then

 (i) x = c is a point of local maxima if f ′(c) = 0 and f ″(c) < 0

The values f (c) is local maximum value of  f .

(ii) x = c is a point of local minima if f ′(c) = 0 and f ″(c) > 0

In this case, f (c) is local minimum value of  f .

(iii) The test fails if f ′(c) = 0 and f ″(c) = 0.

In this case, we go back to the first derivative test and find whether c is
a point of maxima, minima or a point of inflexion.

® Working rule for finding absolute maxima and/or absolute minima

Step 1: Find all critical points of f in the interval, i.e., find points x where
either f ′(x) = 0 or f is not differentiable.

Step 2:Take the end points of the interval.

Step 3: At all these points (listed in Step 1 and 2), calculate the values of  f .

Step 4: Identify the maximum and minimum values of f out of the values
calculated in Step 3. This maximum value will be the absolute maximum
value of  f  and the minimum value will be the absolute minimum value of  f .
