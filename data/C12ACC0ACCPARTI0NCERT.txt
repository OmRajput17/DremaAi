‘relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business
carried on by all or any of them acting for all’.

Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are individually
called ‘partners’ and collectively called ‘firm’. The name under which the business
is carried is called the ‘firm’s name’. A partnership firm has no separate legal
entity, apart from the partners constituting it. Thus, the essential features of
partnership are:

1. Two or More Persons: In order to form partnership, there should be at
least two persons coming together for a common goal. In other words,
the minimum number of partners in a firm can be two. There is however,
a limit on their maximum number. By virtue of Section 464 of the
Companies Act 2013, the Central Government is empowered to prescribe
maximum number of partners in a firm but the number of partners can
not be more than 100. The Central government has prescribed the
maximum number of partness in a firm to be 50.

2. Agreement: Partnership is the result of an agreement between two or
more persons to do business and share its profits and losses. The
agreement becomes the basis of relationship between the partners. It is
not necessary that such agreement is in written form. An oral agreement
is equally valid. But in order to avoid disputes, it is preferred that the
partners have a written agreement.

3. Business: The agreement should be to carry on some business. Mere co-
ownership of a property does not amount to partnership. For example, if
Rohit and Sachin jointly purchase a plot of land, they become the joint
owners of the property and not the partners. But if they are in the business
of purchase and sale of land for the purpose of making profit, they will
be called partners.

4. Mutual Agency: The business of a partnership concern may be carried
on by all the partners or any of them acting for all. This statement has
two important implications. First, every partner is entitled to participate
in the conduct of the affairs of its business. Second, that there exists a
relationship of mutual agency between all the partners. Each partner
carrying on the business is the principal as well as the agent for all the
other partners. He can bind other partners by his acts and also is bound
by the acts of other partners with regard to business of the firm.
Relationship of mutual agency is so important that one can say that
there would be no partnership, if the element of mutual agency is absent.

5. Sharing of Profit: Another important element of partnership is that, the
agreement between partners must be to share profits and losses of a
business. Though the definition contained in the Partnership Act describes
partnership as relation between people who agree to share the profits of
a business, the sharing of loss is implied. Thus, sharing of profits and

Reprint 2025-26



Accounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts 3

losses is important. If some persons join hands for the purpose of some
charitable activity, it will not be termed as partnership.

6. Liability of Partners: Each partner is liable jointly with all the other
partners and also severally to the third party for all the acts of the firm
done while he is a partner. Not only that the liability of a partner for acts
of the firm is also unlimited. This implies that his private assets can also
be used for paying off the firm’s debts.

1.2 Partnership Deed

Partnership comes into existence as a result of agreement among the partners.
The agreement can be either oral or written. The Partnership Act does not require
that the agreement must be in writing. But wherever it is in writing, the document,
which contains terms of the agreement  is called ‘Partnership Deed’. It generally
contains the details about all the aspects affecting the relationship between the
partners including the objective of business, contribution of capital by each
partner, ratio in which the profits and the losses will be shared by the partners
and entitlement of partners to interest on capital, interest on loan, etc.

The clauses of partnership deed can be altered with the consent of all the
partners. The deed should be properly drafted and prepared as per the provisions
of the ‘Stamp Act’ and preferably registered with the Registrar of Firms.

Contents of the Partnership Deed

The Partnership Deed usually contains the following details:
• Names and Addresses of the firm and its main business;
• Names and Addresses of all partners;
• Amount of capital to be contributed by each partner;
• The accounting period of the firm;
• The date of commencement of partnership;
• Rules regarding operation of Bank Accounts;
• Profit and loss sharing ratio;
• Rate of interest on capital, loan, drawings, etc;
• Mode of auditor’s appointment, if any;
• Salaries, commission, etc, if payable to any partner;
• The rights, duties and liabilities of each partner;
• Treatment of loss arising out of insolvency of one or more partners;
• Settlement of accounts on dissolution of the firm;
• Method of settlement of disputes among the partners;
• Rules to be followed in case of admission, retirement, death of a partner; and
• Any other matter relating to the conduct of business.

Normally, the partnership deed covers all matters affecting relationship of
partners amongst themselves. However, if there is no express agreement on
certain matters, the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 shall apply.

4 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts

1.2.1 Provisions of Partnership Act Relevant for Accounting
The important provisions affecting partnership accounts are as follows:

(a) Profit Sharing Ratio: If the partnership deed is silent about the profit
sharing ratio, the profits and losses of the firm are to be shared equally
by partners, irrespective of their capital contribution in the firm.

(b) Interest on Capital: No partner is entitled to claim any interest on the
amount of capital contributed by him in the firm as a matter of right.
However, interest can be allowed when it is expressly agreed to by the
partners. Thus, no interest on capital is payable if the partnership deed
is silent on the issue.

(c) Interest on Drawings: No interest is to be charged on the drawings made
by the partners, if there is no mention in the Deed.

(d) Interest on Loan: If any partner has advanced loan to the firm for the
purpose of business, he/she shall be entitled to get an interest on the
loan amount at the rate of 6 per  cent per annum.

(e) Remuneration for Firm’s Work: No partner is entitled to get salary or
other remuneration for taking part in the conduct of the business of the
firm unless there is a provision for the same in the Partnership Deed.

Apart from the above, the Indian Partnership Act specifies that subject to
contract between the partners:

(i) If a partner derives any profit for him/her self from any transaction of the
firm or from the use of the property or business connection of the firm or
the firm name, he/she shall account for the profit and pay it to the firm.

(ii) If a partner carries on any business of the same nature as and competing
with that of the firm, he/she shall account for and pay to the firm, all
profit made by him/her in that business.

(i) Valid partnership can be formulated even without a written agreement
between the partners;

(ii) Each partner carrying on the business is the principal as well as the agent
for all the other partners;

(iii) Maximum number of partners can be 50;
(iv) Methods of settlement of dispute among the partners can’t be part of the

partnership deed;

(v) If the deed is silent, interest at the rate of 6% p.a. would be charged on the
drawings made by the partner;

(vi) Interest on partner’s loan is to be given @ 12% p.a., if the deed is silent
about the rate.

1.3 Special Aspects of Partnership Accounts

Accounting treatment for partnership firm is similar to that of a sole
proprietorship business with the exception of the following aspects:

• Maintenance of Partners’ Capital Accounts;
• Distribution of Profit and Loss among the partners;
• Adjustments for Wrong Appropriation of Profits in the Past;
• Reconstitution of the Partnership Firm; and
• Dissolution of Partnership Firm.
The first three aspects mentioned above have been taken up in the following

sections of this chapter. The remaining aspects have been covered in the
subsequent chapters.

1.4 Maintenance of Capital Accounts of Partners

All transactions relating to partners of the firm are recorded in the books of the
firm through their capital accounts. This includes the amount of money brought
in as capital, withdrawal of capital, share of profit, interest on capital, interest
on drawings, partner’s salary, commission to partners, etc.

There are two methods by which the capital accounts of partners can be
maintained. These are: (i) fixed capital method, and (ii) fluctuating capital
method. The difference between the two lies in whether or not the transactions
other than addition/withdrawal of capital are recorded in the capital accounts
of the partners.

(a) Fixed Capital Method: Under the fixed capital method, the capitals of the
partners shall remain fixed unless additional capital is introduced or a
part of the capital is withdrawn as per the agreement among the partners.
All items like share of profit or loss, interest on capital, drawings, interest
on drawings, etc. are recorded in a separate accounts, called Partner’s
Current Account. The partners’ capital accounts will always show a credit
balance, which shall remain the same (fixed) year after year unless there
is any addition or withdrawal of capital. The partners’ current account
on the other hand, may show a debit or a credit balance. Thus under
this method, two accounts are maintained for each partner viz., capital
account and current account, While the partners’ capital accounts shall
always appear on the liabilities side in the balance sheet, the partners’
current account’s balance shall be shown on the liabilities side, if they
have credit balance and on the assets side, if they have debit balance.

The partner’s capital account and the current account under the fixed capital
method would appear as shown in Fig.1.1.

(b) Fluctuating Capital Method: Under the fluctuating capital method, only
one account, i.e. capital account is maintained for each partner. All the
adjustments such as share of profit and loss, interest on capital, drawings,
interest on drawings, salary or commission to partners, etc are recorded
directly in the capital accounts of the partners. This makes the balance
in the capital account to fluctuate from time to time. That’s the reason
why this method is called fluctuating capital method. In the absence of
any instruction, the capital account should be prepared by this method.

The proforma of capital accounts prepared under the fluctuating capital method
is given in Fig.1.2.

1.5 Distribution of Profit among Partners

The profits and losses of the firm are distributed among the partners in an agreed
ratio. However, if the partnership deed is silent, the firm’s profits and losses are
to be shared equally by all the partners.

You know that in the case of sole partnership the profit or loss, as ascertained
by the profit and loss account is transferred to the capital account of the
proprietor. In case of partnership, however, certain adjustments such as interest
on drawings, interest on capital, salary to partners, and commission to partners
are required to be made. For this purpose, it is customary to prepare a Profit
and Loss Appropriation Account of the firm and ascertain the final figure of
profit and loss to be distributed among the partners, in their profit
sharing ratio.

1.5.1 Profit and Loss Appropriation Account

Profit and Loss Appropriation Account is merely an extension of the Profit and
Loss Account of the firm. It shows how the profits are appropriated or distributed
among the partners. All adjustments in respect of partner’s salary, partner’s
commission, interest on capital, interest on drawings, etc. are made through
this account. It starts with the net profit/net loss as per Profit and Loss Account.
The journal entries for preparation of Profit and Loss Appropriation Account
and making various adjustments through it are given as follows:

1. Raju and Jai commenced business in partnership on April 1, 2019. No
partnership agreement was made whether oral or written. They contributed Rs.
4,00,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively as capitals. In addtion, Raju advanced
Rs. 2,00,000 as loan to the firm on October 1, 2019. Raju had met with an
accident on July 1, 2017 and could not attend the business up to september 30,
2017. The profit for the year ended March 31, 2020 amounted to Rs, 50,600.
Disputes have arisen between them on sharing the profits of the firm.

      Raju Claims:
(i) He should be given interest at 10% p.a. on capital and so also on loan.

(ii) Profit should be distributed in the proportion of capitals.
Jai Claims:

(i) Net profit should be shared equally.
(ii) He should be allowed remuneration of Rs, 1,000 p.a. during the period of

Raju’s illness.
(iii) Interest on capital and loan should be given @ 6% p.a.

State the correct position on each issue as per the provisions of the
Partnership Act. 1932.

2. Reena and Raman are partners with capitals of Rs. 3,00,000 and Rs. 1,00,000
respectively. The profit for the year ended March 31, 2020 was Rs. 1,80,000,
before paying rent for her personal building to be used as godown for firm to
Reena payable at Rs. 5000 per month. Interest on capital is to be allowed at
6% p.a. Raman was entitled to a salary of Rs. 30,000 p.a. The drawings of
partners were Rs. 30,000 and 20,000. The interest on drawings to be charged
to Reena was Rs. 1,000 and to Raman, Rs. 500.

Assuming that Reena and Raman are equal partners. State their share of
profit after necessary appropriations.

Note: Payment of Rent to Reena is an expense for the business. Hence,
it is change against profits.

1.5.2 Interest on Capital

No interest is allowed on partners’ capitals unless it is expressly agreed among
the partners. When the Deed specifically provides for it, interest on capital is

Reprint 2025-26



16 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts

credited to the partners at the agreed rate with reference to the time period for
which the capital remained in business during a financial year. Interest on capital
is generally provided for in two situations: (i) when the partners contribute
unequal amounts of capitals but share profits equally, and (ii) where the capital
contribution is same but profit sharing is unequal.

Interest on capital is calculated with due allowance for any addition or
withdrawal of capital during the accounting period. For example, Mohini, Rashmi
and Navin entered into partnership, bringing in Rs. 3,00,000, Rs. 2,00,000 and
Rs. 1,00,000 respectively into the business. They decided to share profits and
losses equally and agreed that interest on capital will be provided to the partners
@10 per cent per annum. There was no addition or withdrawal of capital by any
partner during the year. The interest on capital works out to Rs. 30,000
(10% on 30,000) for  Mohini, Rs. 20,000 (10% on 2,00,000) for Rashmi, and Rs.
10,000 (10% on 1,00,000) for Navin.

Take another case of Mansoor and Reshma who are partners in a firm and
their capital accounts showed the balance of Rs. 2,00,000 and Rs. 1,50,000
respectively on April 1, 2019. Mansoor introduced additional capital of
Rs. 1,00,000 on August 1, 2019 and Reshma brought in further capital of
Rs. 1,50,000 on October 1, 2019. Interest is to be allowed @ 6% p.a. on the
capitals. It shall be worked as follows:

= Rs. 9,000+Rs. 4,500= Rs. 13,500
When there are both addition and withdrawal of capital by the partners during

a financial year, the interest on capital is calculated as follows:
(i) On the opening balance of the capital accounts of partners, interest is

calculated for the whole year;
(ii) On the additional capital brought in by any partner during the year,

interest is calculated from the date of introduction of additional capital
to the last day of the financial year.

(iii) In case of withdrawal of capital, interest on capital will be calculated as:
On opening capital from the beginning of the year till date of capital
withdrawn and then on the reduced capital for the remaining time period.
Alternatively, it can be calculated with respect of amount remained in
business for the relevant period.

Sometimes opening capitals of partners may not be given. In such a situation
before calculation of interest on capital the opening capitals will have to be worked
out with the help of partners’ closing capitals by marking necessary adjustments
for the additions and withdrawal of capital, drawings, share of profit or loss, if
already shown in the capital accounts the partners.

As clarified earlier, the interest on capital is allowed only when the firm has
earned profit during the accounting year. Hence, no interest will be allowed
during the year the firm has incurred net loss and if in a year, the profit of the firm
is less than the amount due to the partners as interest on capital, the  payment
of interest will be restricted to the amount of profits. In that case, the profit will
be effectively distributed in the ratio of interest on capital of each partner.

Anupam and Abhishek are partners sharing profits and losses in the ratio
of 3 : 2. Their capital accounts showed balances of Rs. 1,50,000 and Rs.
2,00,000 respectively on April 01, 2019. Show the calculation of interest on
capital for the year ending  December 31, 2020 in each of the following
alternatives:

(a) If the partnership deed is silent as to the payment of interest on capital
and the profit for the year is Rs. 50,000;

(b) If partnership deed provides for interest on capital @ 8% p.a. and the
firm incurred a loss of Rs. 10,000 during the year;

(c) If partnership deed provides for interest on capital @ 8% p.a. and the
firm earned a profit of Rs. 50,000 during the year;

(d) If the partnership deed provides for interest on capital @ 8% p.a. and the
firm earned a profit of Rs. 14,000 during the year.

Solution

(a) In the absence of a specific provision in the Deed, no interest will be paid on the
capital to the partners. The whole amount of profit will however be distributed

among the partners in their profit sharing ratio.
(b) As the firm has incurred losses during the accounting year, no interest on capital

will be allowed to any partner. The firm’s loss will however be shared by the partners
in their profit sharing ratio.

Rs.  .

(c) Interest to Anupam @ 8% on Rs. 1,50,000 = 12,000

Interest to Abhishek @ 8% on Rs. 2,00,000 = 16,000

28,000

As the profit is sufficient to pay interest at agreed rate, the whole amount of
interest on capital shall be allowed and the remaining profit amounting to
Rs. 22,000 (Rs. 50,000 – Rs. 28,000) shall be shared by the partners in their
profit sharing ratio.

(d) As the profit for the year is Rs. 14,000, which is less than the amount of
interest on capital due to partners, i.e. Rs. 28,000 (Rs. 12,000 for
Anupam and Rs. 16,000 for Abhishek), interest will be paid to the extent
of available profit i.e., Rs. 14,000. Anupam and Abhishek will be
credited with Rs. 6,000 and Rs. 8,000, respectively. Effectively this
amounts to sharing the firm’s profit in the ratio of interest on capital,
i.e., 3:4.

1.5.3 Interest on Drawings

The partnership agreement may also provide for charging of interest on money
withdrawn out of the firm  by the partners for their personal use. As stated earlier,
no interest is charged on the drawings if there is no express agreement among the
partners about it. However if the partnership deed so provides for it, the interest is
charged at an agreed rate, for the period for which drawings have been made.
Remained outstanding from the partners during an accounting year. Charging
interest on drawings discourages excessive amounts of drawings by the partners.

The calculation of interest on drawings under different situations is shown
as here under.

When Fixed Amounts was Withdrawn Every Month

Many a time, a fixed amount of money is withdrawn by the partners, at equal
time interval, say each month or each quarter. While calculating the time period,
attention must be paid to whether the fixed amount was withdrawn at the
beginning (first day) of the month, middle of the month or at the end (last day) of
the month. If withdrawn on the first day of every month, interest on total amount
will be calculated for 6½ months; if withdrawn at the end at every month, it will
be calculated for 5½ months, and if withdrawn during the middle of the month,
it will be calculated for 6 months.

Suppose, Aashish withdrew Rs. 10,000 per month from the firm for his personal
use during the year ending March 31, 2017. The calculation of average period
and the interest on drawings, in different situations would be as follows:

(a) When the amount is withdrawn at the beginning of each month:

 No. of months of 1 drawings + No. of month of last drawings
Average Period = =

 = 6  months.

Average Period =  =

2

11+ 0 1

2 2

Interest on Drawings = = Rs. 4,400.

(c) When money is withdrawn in the middle of the month

When money is withdrawn in the middle of the month, nothing is added or
deduced from the total period.

No. of months of 1 drawings + No. of month of last drawings 11.5+0.5
Average Period = =  =

2 2
6 months

Interest on Drawings =  = Rs. 4,800.

When Fixed Amount is withdrawn Quarterly

When fixed amount of money is withdrawn quarterly by partners, in such a
situation, for the purpose of calculation of interest, the total period of time is
ascertained depending on whether the money was withdrawn at the beginning
or at the end of each quarter. If the amount is withdrawn at the beginning of
each quarter, the interest is calculated on the total money withdrawn during the

12+ 3
year, for a period of seven and half months i.e., and if withdrawn at the

2

9+0
end of each quarter it will be calculated for a period of 4½ months, i.e., .

When Varying Amounts are Withdrawn at Different Intervals

When the partners withdraw different amounts of money at different time
intervals, the interest is calculated using the product method. Under the product
method, for each withdrawal, the money withdrawn is multiplied by the period
(usually expressed in months) for which it remained withdrawn during the
financial year. The period is calculated from the date of the withdrawal to the
last day of the accounting year. The products so calculated are totalled on the
total of the products interest at the specified rate is calculated as under:

that interest on drawings should be charged @ 6% p.a. Verma withdraws
Rs. 2,000 per month starting from April 01, 2019 to March 31, 2020. Kaul
withdrew Rs, 3,000 per quarter, starting from April 01, 2019. Calculate interest
on partner’s drawings.

When Dates of Withdrawal are not specified

When the total amount withdrawn is given but the dates of withdrawals are not
specified, it is assumed that the amount was withdrawn evenly throughout the
year. For example; Shakila withdrew Rs. 60,000 from partnership firm during
the year ending March 31, 2020 and the interest on drawings is to be charged
at the rate of 8 per cent per annum. For calculation of interest, the period would
be taken as six months, which is the average period assuming, that amount is
withdrawn evenly in the middle of the month, throughout the year. The amount
of interest on drawings works out to be Rs. 2,400 as follows:

1.6  Guarantee of Profit to a Partner

Sometimes a partner is admitted into the firm with a guarantee of certain
minimum amount by way of his share of profits of the firm. Such assurance
may be given by all the old partners  in a certain ratio or by any of the old
partners, individually to the new partner. The minimum guaranteed amount
shall be paid to such new partner when his share of profit as per the profit
sharing ratio is less than the guarnteed amount. For example, Madhulika and
Rakshita, who are partners in a firm decide to admit Kanishka into their firm,
giving her the guarantee of a minimum of Rs.25,000 as her share in firm’s profits.
The firm earned a profit of Rs.1,20,000 during the year and the agreed profit
sharing ratio between the partners is decided as 2:3:1. As per this ratio,
Madhulika’s share in profit comes to Rs.40,000 (2/6 of Rs. 1,20,000); Rakshita,
Rs. 60,000 (3/6 of Rs. 1,20,000) and Kanishka Rs. 20,000 (1/6 of Rs. 1,20,000).
The share of Kanishka works out to be Rs.5,000 short of the guaranteed amount.
This shall be borne by the guaranteeing partners Madhulika and Rakshita in

Reprint 2025-26

their profit sharing ratio, which in this case is 2:3, Madhulika’s share in the
deficiency comes to Rs.2,000 (2/5 of Rs. 5,000), and that of Rakshita Rs.3,000.
The total profit of the firm will be distributed among the partners as follows
Madhulika will get Rs.38,000 (her share 40,000 minus share in deficiency
Rs.2,000); Rakshita Rs.57,000 (60,000–3,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000
(Rs. 20,000 + Rs. 2,000 + Rs. 3,000).

If only one partner gives the guarantee, say in the above case, only Rakshita
gives the guarantee, the whole amount of deficiency (Rs.5,000) will be borne by
her only. In that case profit distribution will be Madhulika Rs.40,000, Rakshita
Rs. 55,000 (60,000–5,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000 (Rs. 20,000 + Rs. 5,000).

Working Notes:

The new profit sharing ratio after admission of Rahul comes to 2:1:1. As per this ratio the
share of partners in the profit comes to:

Mohit = Rs. 1,60,000 × = Rs. 80,000

Rahul = Rs. 1,60,000 × = Rs. 40,000

But, since Rahul has been given a guarantee of minimum of Rs. 50,000 as his share of

profit. The deficiency of Rs. 10,000 (Rs. 50,000 – Rs. 40,000) shall be borne by Mohit and
Rohan in the ratio in which they share profits and losses between themselves, viz. 2:1
as follows:

Mohit’s share in deficiency comes to 2/3 × Rs. 10,000 =  Rs.  6,667
Rohan’s share in deficiency comes to 1/3 × Rs. 10,000 = Rs. 3,333

Thus Mohit will get Rs. 80,000 – Rs. 6,667 = Rs. 73,333, Rohan will get
Rs. 40,000–Rs. 3,333 = Rs. 36,667 and Rahul will get Rs. 40,000 + Rs. 6,667 + Rs. 3,333 =
Rs. 50,000 in the profit of the firm.

1.7  Past Adjustments

Sometimes a few omissions or errors in the recording of transactions or the
preparation of summary statements are found after the final accounts have been
prepared and the profits distributed among the partners. The omission may be
in respect of interest on capitals, interest on drawings, interest on partners’ loan,
partner’s salary, partner’s commission or outstanding expenses. There may also
be some changes in the provisions of partnership deed or system of accounting
having impact with retrospective effect. All these acts of omission and commission
need adjustments for correction of their impact. Instead of altering old accounts,
necessary adjustments can be made either; (a) through ‘Profit and Loss
Adjustment Account’, or (b) directly in the capital accounts of the concerned
partners. This is explained with the help of following example.

Rameez and Zaheer are equal partners. Their capitals as on April 01, 2015
were Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively. After the accounts for the financial
year ending March 31, 2016 have been prepared, it is discovered that interest at
the rate of 6 per cent per annum, as provided in the partnership deed has not
been credited to the partners’ capital accounts before distribution of profit. In
this case, the interest on capital not credited to the partners’ capital accounts
works out to be Rs. 3000 (6/100 × Rs. 50,000) for Rameez and Rs. 6,000
(6/100 × Rs. 1,00,000) for Zaheer. Had the interest on capital been duly provided,
the firm’s profit would have reduced by Rs. 9,000. By this omission, the whole
amount of  profit as per Profit and Loss Account (without adjustment of Rs.
9,000) has been distributed among the partners in their profit sharing ratio,
and the amounts of interest on capital have not been credited to their capital
accounts. This error can be rectified in any of the following ways;

(b) Directly in Partners’ Capital Accounts

For direct adjustment in partners’ capital accounts first a statement to ascertain
the net effect of omission on partners’ capital accounts will be worked out as
follows and then the adjustment entries can be recorded.

Summary

1. Definition of partnership and its essential features: Partnership is defined as
“Relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business
carried on by all or any one of them acting for all”. The essential features of
partnership are : (i) To form a partnership, there must be at least two persons;
(ii) It is created by an agreement; (iii) The agreement should be for carrying on
some legal business; (iv) sharing of profits and losses; and (v) relationship of
mutual agency among the partners.

2. Meaning and contents of partnership deed: A document which contains the terms
of partnership as agreed among the partners is called ‘Partnership Deed’. It
usually contains information about all aspects affecting relationship between
partners, including objective of business, contribution of capital by each partner,
ratio in which profit and losses will be shared by the partners, entitlement of
partners to interest on capital, interest on loan and the rules to be followed in
case of admission, retirement, death, dissolution, etc.

3. Provisions of Partnership Act 1932 applicable to accounting: If partnership deed
is silent in respect of certain aspects, the relevant provisions of the Indian
Partnership Act, 1932 become applicable. According to the Partnership Act,
the partners share profits equally, no partner is entitled to remuneration, no
interest on capital is allowed and no interest on drawings is charged. However,
if any partner has given some loan to the firm, he is entitled to interest on such
amount @ 6% per annum.

4. Preparation of capital accounts under fixed and fluctuating capital methods: All
transactions relating to partners are recorded in their respective capital
accounts in the books of the firm. There can be two methods of maintaining
Capital Accounts. These are; (i) fluctuating capital method, (ii) fixed capital
method. Under fluctuating capital method, all the transactions relating to a
partner are directly recorded in the capital account. Under fixed capital method,
however the amount of capital remains fixed, the transactions like interest on
capital, drawings, interest on drawings, salary, commission, share of profit or
loss are recorded in a separate account called ‘Partner’s Current Account’.

5. Distribution of profit and loss: The distribution of profits among the partners is
shown through a Profit and Loss Appropriation Account, which is merely an
extension of the Profit and Loss Account. It is usually debited with interest on
capital and salary/commission allowed to the partners, and credited with net
profit as per Profit and Loss Account and the interest on drawings. The balance
being profit or loss is distributed among the partners in the profit sharing ratio
and transferred to their respective capital accounts.

Reprint 2025-26



36 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts

6. Treatment of guarantee of minimum profit to a partner: Sometimes, a partner
may be guaranteed a minimum amount by way of his share in profits. If, in any
year, the share of profits as calculated according to his profit sharing ratio is
less than the guaranteed amount, the deficiency is made good by the
guaranteeing partners’ in the agreed ratio which usually is the profit sharing
ratio. If, however, such guarantee has been given by any of them, he or they
alone shall bear the amount of deficiency.

7. Treatment of past adjustments: If, after the final accounts have been prepared,
some omission or commissions are noticed say in respect of the interest on
capital, interest on drawings, partner’s salary, commission, etc. necessary
adjustments can be made in the partner’s capital accounts through the Profit
and Loss Adjustment Account, to rectify the same.

8. Preparation of final accounts of a partnership firm: There is not much difference
in the final accounts of a sole proprietary concern and that of a partnership
firm except that in case of a partnership firm an additional account called
Profit and Loss Appropriation Account is prepared to show distribution of profit
and loss among the partners.

3:2.  On April 1, 2017 they admitted John as a new partner with 1/6 share in
profits of the firm. With this change now there are three partners of the firm and
it stands reconstituted.

Change in the profit sharing ratio among the existing partners: Sometimes the
partners of a firm may decide to change their existing profit sharing ratio. This
may happen an account of a change in the existing partners’ role in the firm. For
example, Ram, Mohan and Sohan are partners in a firm sharing profits in the
ratio of 3:2:1. With effect from April 1,2017 they decided to share profits equally
as Sohan brings in additional capital. This results in a  change in the existing
agreement leading to reconstitution of the firm.

Retirement of an existing partner: It means withdrawal by a partner from the
business of the firm which may be due to his bad health, old age or change in
business interests. In fact a partner can retire any time if the partnership is at
will. For example, Roy, Ravi and Rao are partners in the firm sharing profits in
the ratio of 2:2:1.  On account of illness, Ravi retired from the firm on March 31,
2017.  This results in reconstitution of the firm now having only two partners.

Death of a partner: Partnership may also stand reconstituted on death of a
partner, if the remaining partners decide to continue the business of the firm as
usual. For example, X,Y and Z are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio
3:2:1. X died on March 31, 2017. Y and Z decide to carry on the business sharing
future profits equally. The continuity of business by Y and Z sharing future
profits equally leads to reconstitution of the firm.

2.2 Admission of a New Partner

When firm requires additional capital or managerial help or both for the
expansion of its business a new partner may be admitted to supplement its
existing resources.  According to the Partnership Act 1932, a new partner can
be admitted into the firm only with the consent of all the existing partners unless
otherwise agreed upon. With the admission of a new partner, the partnership
firm is reconstituted and a new agreement is entered into to carry on the business
of the firm.

A newly admitted partner acquires two main rights in the firm–
1. Right to share the assets of the partnership firm; and
2. Right to share the profits of the partnership firm.
For the right to acquire share in the assets and profits of the partnership

firm, the partner brings an agreed amount of capital either in cash or in kind.
Moreover, in the case of an established firm which may be earning more profits
than the normal rate of return on its capital the new partner is required to
contribute some additional amount known as premium or goodwill. This is done

Reprint 2025-26



50 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts

primarily to compensate the sacrificing partners for loss of their share in super
profits of the firm.

Following are the other important points which require attention at the time
of admission of a new partner:

1. New profit sharing ratio;
2. Sacrificing ratio;
3. Valuation and adjustment of goodwill;
4. Revaluation of assets and Reassessment of liabilities;
5. Distribution of accumulated profits (reserves); and
6. Adjustment of partners’ capitals.

2.3 New Profit Sharing Ratio

When new partner is admitted he acquires his share in profits from the old partners.
In other words, on the admission of a new partner, the old partners sacrifice a
share of their profit in favour of the new partner.  But, what will be the share of
new partner and how he will acquire it from the existing partners is decided
mutually among the old partners and the new partner. However, if nothing is
specified as to how does the new partner acquire his share from the old partners;
it may be assumed that he gets it from them in their profit sharing ratio. In any
case, on admission of a new partner, the profit sharing ratio among the old
partners will change keeping in view their respective contribution to the profit
sharing ratio of the incoming partner.  Hence, there is a need to ascertain the new
profit sharing ratio among all the partners. This depends upon how does the
new partner acquires his share from the old partners for which there are many
possibilities. Let us understand it with the help of the following illustrations.

Illustration 1

2.4 Sacrificing Ratio

The ratio in which the old partners agree to sacrifice their share of profit in
favour of the incoming partner is called sacrificing ratio.  The sacrifice by a partner
is equal to :

Old Share of Profit – New Share of Profit

Reprint 2025-26



Admission of a Partner 53

As stated earlier, the new partner is required to compensate the old partner’s
for their loss of share in the super profits of the firm for which he brings in an
additional amount as premium for goodwill. This amount is shared by the
existing partners in the ratio in which they forgo their shares in favour of the
new partner which is called sacrificing ratio.

The ratio is normally clearly given as agreed among the partners which could
be the old ratio, equal sacrifice, or a specified ratio. The difficulty arises where
the ratio in which the new partner acquires his share from the old partners is
not specified. Instead, the new profit sharing ratio is given. In such a situation,
the sacrificing ratio is to be worked out by deducting each partner’s new share
from his old share. Look at the illustrations 6 to 8 and see how sacrificing ratio
is calculated in such a situation.

2.5 Goodwill

Goodwill is also one of the special aspects of partnership accounts which requires
adjustment (also valuation if not specified) at the time of reconstitution of a firm
viz., a change in the profit sharing ratio, the admission of a partner or the
retirement or death of a partner.

2.5.1 Meaning of Goodwill

Over a period of time, a well-established business develops an advantage of
good name, reputation and wide business connections. This helps the business
to earn more profits as compared to a newly set up business. In accounting, the
monetary value of such advantage is known as “goodwill”.

It is as an intangible asset. In other words, goodwill is the value of the
reputation of a firm in respect of the profits expected in future over and above
the normal profits. It is generally observed that when a person pays for goodwill,

Reprint 2025-26



56 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts

he/she pays for something, which places him in the position of being able to earn
super profits as compared to the profit earned by other firms in the same industry.

In simple words, goodwill can be defined as “the present value of a firm’s
anticipated excess earnings” or as “the capitalised value attached to the differential
profit capacity of a business”. Thus, goodwill exists only when the firm earns super
profits. Any firm that earns normal profits or is incurring losses has no goodwill.

2.5.2 Factors Affecting the Value of Goodwill

The main factors affecting the value of goodwill are as follows:
1. Nature of business: A firm that produces high value added products or

having a stable demand is able to earn more profits and therefore has
more goodwill.

2. Location: If the business is centrally located or is at a place having heavy
customer traffic, the goodwill tends to be high.

3. Efficiency of management:  A well-managed concern usually enjoys the
advantage of high productivity and cost efficiency. This leads to higher
profits and so the value of goodwill will also be high.

4. Market situation:  The monopoly condition or limited competition enables
the concern to earn high profits which leads to higher value of goodwill.

5. Special advantages:  The firm that enjoys special advantages like import
licences, low rate and assured supply of electricity, long-term contracts
for supply of materials, well-known collaborators, patents, trademarks,
etc. enjoy higher value of goodwill.

2.5.3 Need for Valuation of Goodwill

Normally, the need for valuation of goodwill arises at the time of sale of a business.
But, in the context of a partnership firm it may also arise in the following
circumstances:

1. Change in the profit sharing ratio amongst the existing partners;
2. Admission of new partner;
3. Retirement of a partner;
4. Death of a partner; and
5. Dissolution of a firm involving sale of business as a going concern.
6. Amalgamation of partnership firms.

2.5.4 Methods of Valuation of Goodwill

Since goodwill is an intangible asset it is very difficult to accurately calculate its
value. Various methods have been advocated for the valuation of goodwill of a
partnership firm. Goodwill calculated by one method may differ from the goodwill

Reprint 2025-26



Admission of a Partner 57

calculated by another method. Hence, the method by which goodwill is to be
calculated, may be specifically decided between the existing partners and the
incoming partner.
The important methods of valuation of goodwill are as follows:

1. Average Profits Method
2. Super Profits Method
3. Capitalisation Method

2.5.4.1 Average Profits Method

Under this method, the goodwill is valued at agreed number of ‘years’ purchase
of the average profits of the past few years. It is based on the assumption that a
new business will not be able to earn any profits during the first few years of its
operations. Hence, the person who purchases a running business must pay in
the form of goodwill a sum which is equal to the profits he is likely to receive for
the first few years. The goodwill, therefore, should be calculated by multiplying
the past average profits by the number of years during which the anticipated
profits are expected to accrue.

For example, if the past average profits of a business works out at Rs. 20,000
and it is expected that such profits are likely to continue for another three years,
the value of goodwill will be Rs. 60,000 (Rs. 20,000   3),

Illustration 9

58 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts

The above calculation of goodwill is based on the assumption that no change
in the overall situation of profits is expected in the future.

The above illustration is based on simple average. Sometimes, if there exists
an increasing on decreasing trend, it is considered to be better to give a higher
weightage to the profits to the recent years than those of the earlier years. Hence,
it is a advisable to work out weighted average based on specified weights like 1,
2, 3, 4 for respective year’s profit. However, weighted average should be used
only if specified. (See illustrations 10 and 11).

(iii)    Closing Stock of 2014 will become opening stock for the year 2015.

2.5.4.2 Super Profits Method

The basic assumption in the average profits (simple or weighted) method of
calculating goodwill is that if a new business is set up, it will not be able to
earn any profits during the first few years of its operations. Hence, the person
who purchases an existing business has to pay in the form of goodwill a sum
equal to the total profits he is likely to receive for the first ‘few years’. But it is
contended that the buyer’s real benefit does not lie in total profits; it is limited
to such amounts of profits which are in excess of the normal return on capital
employed in similar business. Therefore, it is desirable to value, goodwill on
the basis of the excess profits and not the actual profits. The excess of actual
profits over the normal profits is termed as super profits.

Firm’s Capital × Normal Rate of Return
Normal Profit  =  

100

Firms capital includes partners capital and reserves and surplus but excludes
fictitious assets and goodwill.

Suppose an existing firm earns Rs. 18,000 on the capital of Rs. 1,50,000
and the normal rate of return is 10%. The Normal profits will work out at
Rs. 15,000 (1,50,000 × 10/100). The super profits in this case will be Rs. 3,000
(Rs. 18,000 – 15,000). The goodwill under the super profit method is ascertained
by multiplying the super profits by certain number of years’ purchase. If, in the
above example, it is expected that the benefit of super profits is likely to be
available for 5 years in future, the goodwill will be valued at Rs. 15,000
(3,000 × 5). Thus, the steps involved under the method are:

1. Calculate the average profit,
2. Calculate the normal profit on the firm’s capital on the basis of the normal

rate of return,
3. Calculate the super profits by deducting normal profit from the average

profits, and
4. Calculate goodwill by multiplying the super profits by the given number

of years’ purchase.

2.5.4.3 Capitalisation Method

Under this method the goodwill can be calculated in two ways: (a) by capitalizing
the average profits, or (b) by capitalising the super profits.

(a) Capitalisation of Average Profits: Under this method, the value of goodwill
is ascertained by deducting the actual firm’s capital in the business from the
capitalized value of the average profits on the basis of normal rate of return.
This involves the following steps:
(i) Ascertain the average profits based on the past few years’ performance.
(ii) Capitalize the average profits on the basis of the normal rate of return to

ascertain the capitalised value of average profits as follows:

Average Profits × 100/Normal Rate of Return

(iii) Ascertain the actual firm’s capital (net assets) by deducting outside
liabilities from the total assets (excluding goodwill and ficticious assets).

  Firms’ Capital = Total Assets (excluding goodwill) – Outside Liabilities

 Where outside Liabilities include both long term and short term Liabilities.

(iv) Compute the value of goodwill by deducting net assets from the
capitalised value of average profits, i.e. (ii) – (iii).

Illustration 14

A business has earned average profits of Rs. 1,00,000 during the last few years
and the normal rate of return in a similar business is 10%. Ascertain the value
of goodwill by capitalisation average profits method, given that the value of net
assets of the business is Rs. 8,20,000.

Goodwill = Capitalised value – Net Assets
= Rs. 10,00,000 – Rs. 8,20,000
= Rs.1,80,000

(b) Capitalisation of Super Profits: Goodwill can also be ascertained by capitalising the
super profit directly. Under this method there is no need to work out the capitalised
value of average profits. It involves the following steps.

(i) Calculate capital of the firm, which is equal to total assets (excluding goodwill
and ficticious assets) minus outside liabilities.

(ii) Calculate normal profits on capital employed.

(iii) Calculate average profit for past years, as specified.
(ii) Calculate super profits by deducting normal profits from average profits.
(iii) Multiply the super profits by the required rate of return multiplier, that is,

Goodwill = Super Profits × 100 Normal Rate of Return

In other words, goodwill is the capitalised value of super profits. The amount of goodwill
worked out by this method will be exactly the same as calculated by capitalising the
average profits.

For example, using the data given in illustration 14 where the average profits are Rs.
1,00,000 and the normal profits are Rs. 82,000 (10% of Rs. 8,20,000), the super profits
worked out as Rs. 18,000 (Rs. 1,00,000 – Rs. 82,000), the goodwill will be calculated as
follows.

Rs. 18,000 ×  = Rs. 1,80,000.

1. Total Profits = Rs. 10,000 + Rs. 15,000 + Rs. 4,000 + Rs. 6,000 – Rs. 5,000
       = Rs. 30,000

Average Profits = Rs. 30,000/5 =  Rs. 6,000

Goodwill=Super Profit   3 =  Rs. 4,000  3  =  Rs. 12,000

3. Normal Profit= Rs. 2,00,000   10/100  =  Rs. 20,000
Super Profit = Average Profit – Normal Profit  =  Rs. 30,000 – Rs. 20,000

Goodwill=Super Profit  100/Normal Rate of Return
=  10,000  100/10 = Rs. 1,00,000.

2.5.5 Treatment of Goodwill

As stated earlier, the incoming partner who acquires his share in the profits of
the firm from the existing partners brings in additional amount to compensate
them for loss of their share in super profits. It is termed as his share of goodwill
(also called premium for goodwill).

2.5.5.1 When the new Partner brings goodwill in cash.

The amount of premium brought in by the new partner is shared by the existing
partners in their ratio of sacrifice. If this amount is paid to the old partners
directly (privately) by the new partner, no entry is passed in the books of the
firm. But, when the amount is paid through the firm, which is generally the
case, the following journal entries are passed:

(i) Bank A/c Dr.
To Premium for Goodwill A/c
(Amount brought by new partner as premium)

(ii) Goodwill A/c Dr.
To Sacrificing Partners Capital A/c

(Individually)(Goodwill distributed among the
existing partners’ in their sacrificing ratio).

Alternatively, it is credited to the new partner’s capital account and then
adjusted in favour of the existing partners in their sacrificing ratio. In that case
the journal entries will be as follows:

Significant requirements of AS 26 w.r.t Intangible Assets:

1. Intangible asset should be recognised by fulfilling the criteria as recognised
under AS 26.

2. If an in asset does not satisfy recognition criteria, it should be expensed.

3. Internally generated goodwill should not be recognised as an asset.

4. Internally generated brands, mastheads, and publishing titles and other similar
in substance should not be recognised as intangible assets.

5. Internally generated assets other than the goodwill, brands, mastheads, and

Admission of a Partner 73

Accounting Standard 26 implies that:
(a) Purchased goodwill may be accounted for in the books and shown as an

asset, where it is accounted for in the books and shown as assets, it
should be written off as early as possible, but where it is to be written- off
in more than one accounting year, it should be written off in a period not
exceeding 10 years. In line with what is prescribed by the Accounting
Standard, goodwill appearing in the balance sheet in written off at the
time of firm's reconstitution.

(b) Self - generated goodwill is not accounted for in the books and shown as
an asset. Thus if self generated goodwill be debited to goodwill account it
should be written - off in the same financial year and should not be
shown as an asset in the balance sheet. Alternatively value of goodwill
may be adjusted by deducting new partners' current account and
crediting in their sacrificing ratio. The effect under both the methods is
same.

2.5.5.2 Hidden Goodwill

Sometimes the value of goodwill is not given at the time of admission of a new
partner. In such a situation it has to be inferred from the arrangement of the
capital and profit sharing ratio.  Suppose, A and B are partners sharing profits
equally with capitals of Rs. 45,000 each. They admitted C as a new partner for
one-third share in the profit. C brings in Rs. 60,000 as his capital.  Based on the
amount brought in by C and his share in profit, the total capital of the newly
constituted firm works out to be Rs.1,80,000 (Rs. 60,000 × 3). But the actual
total capital of A, B and C works out as Rs. 1,50,000 (Rs. 45,000 + Rs. 45,000
+ Rs. 60,000). Hence, it can be inferred that the difference is on account of goodwill
i.e., Rs. 30,000 (Rs. 1,80,000 – Rs. 1,50,000). Which is to be shared equally (old
ratio) by A and B. This shall raise their capital accounts to Rs. 60,000 each and
total capital of the firm to Rs. 1,80,000. In this, C’s Current account will be
debited by Rs. 10,000 (his share of goodwill) and A and B’s Capital accounts
credited by Rs. 5,000 each.

Sometimes a firm may have accumulated profits not yet transferred to capital
accounts of the partners. These are usually in the form of general reserve,
reserve and/or Profit and Loss Account. The new partner is not entitled to
have any share in such accumulated profits. These are distributed among
the partners by transferring it to their capital current accounts in old profit
sharing ratio. Similarly, if there are some accumulated losses in the form of a
debit balance of profit and loss account and/or deferred  revenue expenditure

2.7 Revaluation of Assets and Reassessment of Liabilities

At the time of admission of a new partner, it is always desirable to ascertain
whether the assets of the firm are shown in books at their current values. In
case the assets are overstated or understated, these are revalued. Similarly, a
reassessment of the liabilities is also done so that these are brought in the
books at their correct values.  At times there may also be some unrecorded
assets and liabilities of the firm. These also have to be brought into the books
of the firm. For this purpose the firm has to prepare the Revaluation Account.
The gain or loss on revaluation of each asset and liability is transferred to this
account and finally its balance is transferred to the capital accounts of the old
partners in their old profit sharing ratio.  In other words, the  revaluation

Reprint 2025-26



78 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts

account is credited with increase in the value of each asset and decrease in its
liabilities because it is a gain and is debited with decrease in the value of assets
and increase in its liabilities is debited to revaluation account because it is a
loss. Similarly unrecorded assets are credited and unrecorded liabilities are
debited to the revaluation account. If the revaluation account finally shows a
credit balance then it indicates net gain and if there is a debit balance then it
indicates net loss. Which will be transferred to the capital accounts of the old
partners in old ratio.

upon payment in cash of Rs. 1,500 for one-fourth share of the goodwill and
Rs. 1,800 as his capital, both sums to remain in the business.  The liabilities
of the old firm amount Rs. 3,000 and the assets, apart from cash, consist of
Motors Rs. 1,200,  Furniture Rs. 400, Stock Rs. 2,650, Debtors of Rs. 3,780.

adjustments relating to revaluation, goodwill etc., worked out to be Rs. 45,000
and Rs. 35,000 respectively.
Required: Calculate New Profit sharing ratio, capital to be brought in by Gaurav
and record necessary journal entries for the same.

2.8 Adjustment of Capitals

Sometimes, at the time of admission, the partners agree that their capitals should
also be adjusted so as to be proportionate to their profit sharing ratio.  In such
a situation, if the capital of the new partner is given, the same can be used as a
base for calculating the new capitals of the old partners. The capitals thus
ascertained should be compared with their old capitals after all adjustments
relating to goodwill reserves and revaluation of assets and liabilities, etc. have
been made; and then the partner whose capital falls short, will bring in the
necessary amount to cover the shortage and the partner who has a surplus, will
withdraw the excess amount of capital. (See Illustration 25)

revaluation of assets and liabilities, etc., are Rs. 45,000 and Rs. 15,000
respectively.  It is agreed that partners’ capitals should be according to the new
profit sharing ratio.

Determine the new capitals of A and B and record the necessary journal
entries assuming that the partner whose capital falls short, brings in the amount
of deficiency and the partner who has an excess, withdraws the excess amount.

Solution

1. Calculation of new profit sharing ratio: Assuming the new partner C quires
his share from A and B in their old profit sharing ratio, i.e 2:1.

Total Share = 1

1
C’s Share = 

4

1 3
Remaining Shares = 1− =

A’s New Share = × =

4 3 12

3 1 3
B’s New Share = × =

4 3 12

1 3 3
C’s New Share = × =

4 3 12
Thus, new profit sharing ratio between A,B and C is 6:3:3 or 2:1:1.
2. Required Capital of A and B
C’s capital (who has 1/4 share in profits) is Rs. 20,000. B’s new share in profits
1/4. Hence his capital will also be Rs. 20,000. A’s new share is 2/4 which is double of
C’s share.  Hence his capital will be Rs. 40,000.

Alternatively, based on C’s capital, the total capital of the firm works out at
Rs. 80,000 (4/1 × Rs.20,000). Hence, based on their share in profits, the capital of A and B
will be:

2
A’s capital =   of  80,000  =  Rs. 40,000

4

1
B’s capital =   of  80,000  =  Rs. 20,000

4
The capital of A and B after all adjustments have been made, are Rs. 45,000

and Rs. 15,000 respectively.  Hence, A will withdraw Rs. 5,000 (Rs. 45,000–
Rs.40,000) from the firm whereas B will contribute additional amount of
Rs. 5,000 (Rs. 20,000–Rs.15,000). The journal entries will be :

Sometimes, the total capital of the firm may clearly be specified and it is
agreed that the capital of each partner should be proportionate to his share in
profits.  In such a situation each partner’s capital (including the new partner’s
capital to be brought by him) is calculated on the basis of his share in profits.
By bringing in additional amount or withdrawal of excess amount, the final
capital of each partner can be brought up to the required level.

It may be noted that subject to agreement among the partners, surplus or
deficiency in each old partners’ capital accounts can also be taken care of simply
by transfer to their respective current accounts. (See Illustration 26)

partners are also to be adjusted in the ratio of their respective shares in profits.
The capitals of A, B and C after all adjustments are Rs. 40,000, Rs. 35,000 and

1. New Profit Sharing Ratio

Since nothing is given as to how C acquired his share from A and B. It is assumed that A
and B, between themselves continue to share the profit in the old ratio of 2:1.

C’s Share of Profits =

Thus, new profit sharing ratio between A, B and C is 2:1:1.

2. New Capitals of A and B

C’s capital is Rs 30,000 and his share of profits is 1/4. Based on C’s capital, the total
capital of the firm will work out at Rs 1,20,000 (4/1 × 30,000) and the  respective capitals
of A and B will be as follows :

2.9 Change in Profit Sharing Ratio among the Existing Partners

Sometimes, the partners of a firm decide to change their existing profit sharing
ratio without any admission or retirement of a partner. This results in a gain of
additional share in future profits of the firm for some partners while a loss of a
part thereof for other partners. For example, A, B and C are partners in a firm

94 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts

sharing profits in the ratios of 8:5:3 It is felt that A will no more be able to
actively participate in the affairs of the firm. Hence, with effect from
April 1, 2007, they decided that, in future they will share the profits in the ratio

situation, the loss and

gain in the value of goodwill (if any) will have to be adjusted. This is done by
crediting sacrificing partner's and debiting gaining partner's with appropriate
amounts, as is explained earlier in the context of the admission of a new partners.

Any change, in the profit sharing ratio, like admission of partner, may also
involve adjustments in respect of revaluation of assets and liabilities, transfer of
accumulated profit and losses to partners' capital accounts in the old profit
sharing ratio and adjustment of partners' capitals, if specified, so as to make
them proportionate to the new profit sharing ratio. All this is done in the same
way as in case of admission of a partner.

• Goodwill
• Profit Sharing Ratio
• Reserves
• Revaluation Account

Summary

1. Matters requiring adjustments at the time of admission of a partner: Various
matters which need adjustments in the books of firm at the time of admission
of a new partner are : goodwill, revaluation of assets and liabilities, reserves
and other accumulated profits and losses and the capitals of the old partners’
(if agreed).

2. Determining the new profit sharing ratio and calculating sacrificing ratio: The
new partner acquires his share in profits from the old partners’. This reduces
the old partners’ share in profits. Hence, the problem of determining the new
profit sharing ratio simply involves the determination of old partners’ new share
in the profits of the reconstituted firm. Given the new partners’ share in profits
and the ratio, in which he acquires it from the old partners, the new share of
each old partner shall be worked out by deducting his share of sacrifice from
his old share in profits. The ratio in which the old partners have agreed to
sacrifice their shares in profit in favour of the new partner is called the
sacrificing ratio. It is usually same as the old profit sharing ratio. However,
based on the agreement it can be different also.

3. Treatment of Goodwill: Goodwill is an intangible asset and belonges to its owner
at a point of time. On the admission of a new partner the goodwill of the firm
belongs to the old partners. It means that on the admission of a new partner
some adjustments must be made into the capital accounts of the old  partners
for goodwill so that the new partner will not acquire a share in that profit
which the firm earns because of its goodwill earned before admission without
making any payment for the same. The amount that the new partner pays for
goodwill is called goodwill. From accounting point of view the firm may have to
face different situations for the treatment of goodwill at the time of admission of
a partner. The amount of premium brought in by the new partner is shared by
old partners in the ratio of sacrifice. In case the new partner fails to bring his

Reprint 2025-26



98 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts

share of premium for goodwill in cash than the capital account of the new
partner is debited for his share of premium of goodwill and the old partners
capital accounts are credited in their sacrificing ratio.

4. Adjustments for Revaluation of Assets and Reassessment of Liabilities: If, at
the time of admission of a partner, the assets and liabilities are revalued or
some asset or liability is found unrecorded, necessary adjustments are made
through the Revaluatiion Account. Any gain or loss arising from such exercise
shall be distributed among the old partner’s in their old profit sharing ratio.

5. Adjustment for reserves and accumulated profits/losses: If, at the time of
admission of a partner, any reserve and accumulated profits or losses exist in
books of the firm, these should be transferred to old partner’s capital/current
accounts in their old profit sharing ratio.

6. Determining/Adjusting partners’ capital: If agreed, the partner’s capital may
be adjusted so as to be proportionate to their new profit sharing ratio. In that
case, the new partner’s capital is normally used as a base for  determining the
new capitals of the old partners and necessary adjustment made through case
or by transfer to partner’s current accounts. Other basis also may be available
for determining capitals of the partners after admissioin of the new partner
like sharing the total capital to be in the firm immeidately after admission of
the new partner.

7. Change in profit sharing ratio: Sometimes the partners of a firm may agree to
change their existing profit sharing ratio. With a result, some partners will
gain in future profits while others will lose. In such a situation, the partner
who gain by change in profit effecting amounts to one partner buying the share
of profit from another partner. Apart from the payment for compensation, the
change in profit sharing ratio also necessitates adjustment in partners’ capital
accounts with respect to undistributed profits and reserves, revaluation of
assets and reassessment of liabilities.

Questions for Practice

Short Answer Questions

1. Identify various matters that need adjustments at the time of admission of a

(vi) his share of profits up to the date of retirement/death;
(vii) interest on his capital, if involved, up to the date of retirement/death; and
(viii) salary/commission, if any, due to him up to the date of retirement/death.

The following deductions, if any, may have to be made from his share:
(i) debit balance of his current account (if any);
(ii) his share of goodwill to be written off, if necessary;

(v) his share of loss up to the date of retirement/death;
(vi) his drawings up to the date of  retirement/death;
(vii) interest on drawings, if involved, up to the date of retirement/death.

Thus, similar to admission, the various accounting aspects involved on retirement
or death of a partner are as follows:

1. Ascertainment of new profit sharing ratio and gaining ratio;
2. Treatment of goodwill;
3. Revaluation of assets and  liabilities;
4. Adjustment in respect of unrecorded assets and liabilities;
5. Distribution of accumulated profits and losses;
6. Ascertainment of share of profit or loss up to the date of retirement/death;
7. Adjustment of capital, if required;
8. Settlement of the amounts due to retired/deceased partner;

3.2 New Profit Sharing Ratio

New profit sharing ratio is the ratio in which the remaining partners will share
future profits after the retirement or death of any partner. The new share of each
of the remaining partner will consist of his own share in the firm plus the share
acquired from the retiring /deceased partner.
      Consider the following situations :

(a) normally, the continuing partners acquire the share of retiring or deceased
partners in the old profit sharing ratio, and there is no need to compute the
new profit sharing ratio among them, as it will be same as the old profit
sharing ratio among them. In fact, in the absence of any information regarding
profit sharing ratio in which the remaining partners acquire the share of
retiring/deceased partner, it is assumed that they will acquire it in the old
profit sharing ratio and so share the future profits in their old ratio. For
example, Asha, Deepti and Nisha are partners in a firm sharing profits and
losses in the ratio of 3:2:1. If Deepti retires, the new profit sharing ratio
between Asha and Nisha will be 3:1, unless they decide otherwise.
(b) The continuing partners may acquire the share in the profits of the
retiring/deceased partner in a proportion other than their old ratio, In that
case, there is need to compute the new profit sharing ratio among them.
For example: Naveen, Suresh and Tarun are partners sharing profits and
losses in the ratio of 5:3:2. Suresh retires from the firm and his share was

Reprint 2025-26



Retirement/Death of a Partner 109

required by Naveen and Tarun in the ratio 2:1. In such a case, the new
share of profit will be calculated as follows:

New share of Continuing Partner = Old Share + Acquired share from
           the Outgoing Partner

Gaining Ratio 2 : 1

2 3
Share acquired by Naveen =  of

Share of Tarun = + =

Thus, the new profit sharing ratio of Naveen and Tarun will be = 7 : 3.
(c) The contributing partners may agree on a specified new profit sharing
ratio: In that case the ratio so specified will be the new profit sharing ratio.

3.3 Gaining Ratio

The ratio in which the continuing partners have acquired the share from the
retiring/deceased partner is called the gaining ratio. Normally, the continuing
partners acquire the share of retiring/deceased partner in their old profit sharing
ratio, In that case, the gaining ratio of the remaining partners will be the same
as their old profit sharing ratio among them and there is no need to compute the
gaining ratio, Alternatively, proportion in which they acquire the share of the
retiring/deceased partner may be duly spacified. In that case, again, there is no
need to calculate the gaining ratio as it will be the ratio in which they have
acquired the share of profit from the retiring deceased partner. The problem of
calculating gaining ratio arises primarily when the new profit sharing ratio of
the continuing partners is specified. In such a situation, the gaining ratio should
be calculated by, deducting the old share of each continuing partners from his
new share i.e., new profit share minus old profit share, i.e., new profit share
minus old profit share. For example, Amit, Dinesh and Gagan are partners
sharing profits in the ratio of 5:3:2.

Dinesh retires. Amit and Gagan decide to share the profits of the new firm in
the ratio of  3:2. The gaining ratio will be calculated as follows :

2. Neha retires
3. Tina retires.

Solution

Given old ratio among   Madhu :  Neha : Tina as 5 : 3 : 2

1. If  Madhu retires, new profit sharing Ratio between Neha and Tina will be
Neha : Tina = 3:2 and Gaining Ratio of Neha and Tina =3:2

2. If  Neha retires new profit sharing Ratio between Madhu and Tina will be
Madhu : Tina = 5:2
Gaining Ratio of Madhu and Tina = 5:2

3. If  Tina retires, new profit sharing ratio between Madhu and Neha will be:
Madhu : Neha = 5:3
Gaining ratio of Madhu and Neha = 5:3

3.4  Treatment of Goodwill

The retiring or deceased partner is entitled to his share of goodwill at the time of
retirement/death because the goodwill has been earned by the firm with the
efforts of all the existing partners. Hence, at the time of retirement/death of a
partner, goodwill is valued as per agreement among the partners the retiring/
deceased partner compensated for his share of goodwill by the continuing
partners (who have gained due to acquisition of share of profit from the retiring/
deceased partner) in their gaining ratio.

The accounting treatment for goodwill in such a situation depends upon
whether or, not goodwill already appears in the books of the firm.

3.4.1 When goodwill does not appear in the books

When goodwill does not appear in the books of the firm, credit is given to the retiring
partner for the share in goodwill by debiting the goodwill account to gaining partners
capital accounts (individually) in their gaining ratio. The journal entry is :

Gaining Partners Capital A/c                   Dr.    (Individually)
      To Retiring Partners Capital A/c
(Share in goodwill of retiring partner adjusted)
Let us take an example to understand the treatment of goodwill.
A, B and C are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2:1 B retired

and the value of goodwill of the firm in valued at Rs. 60,000. A and C continue
the business sharing profits in the ratio of 3:1. The journal entry for adjustment

C's Capital A/c Dr. 5,000
To B's Capital A/c 20,000

(B's share of goodwill adjusted to remaining partners' capital accounts in
their gaining ratio)

It may also happen that as a result of decision on the new profit sharing
ratio among the remaining partners, a continuing partner may also sacrifice a
part of his share in future profits. In such a situation his capital account will
also be credited along with the retiring/deceased partner’s capital account in
proportion to his sacrifice and the other continuing partners’ capital accounts
will be debited based on their gain in the future profit ratio.

3.5   Adjustment for Revaluation of Assets and Liabilities

At the time of retirement or death of a partner there may be some assets which
may not have been shown at their current values. Similarly, there may be certain
liabilities which have been shown at a value different from the obligation to be
met by the firm. Not only that, there may be some unrecorded assets and liabilities
which need to be brought into books. As learnt in case of admission of a partner,
a Revaluation Account is prepared in order to ascertain net gain (loss) on
revaluation of assets and/or liabilities and bringing unrecorded items into firm’s
books and the same is transferred to the capital account of all partners including

3.6 Adjustment of Accumulated Profits and Losses

Sometimes, the Balance Sheet of a firm may show accumulated profits in the
form of general reserve and/on accumulated losses in the form of profit and loss
account debit balance. The retiring/deceased partner is entitled to his/her share
in the accumulated profits and is also liable to share the accumulated losses, if
any. These accumulated profits or losses belong to all the partners and should
be transferred to the capital accounts of all partners in their old profit sharing
ratio. The following journal entries are recorded for the purpose.

When Partner Retires in the Middle of the Year

Normally retirement of a partner takes place at the end of accounting period. But
there can be a case where a partner decides to retire in the middle of the year. In
such a case the claim shall include share of profit or loss, interest on capital,
interest on drawings if any, from the date of last balance sheet to the date  of
retirement. Here, the main problem relates to the calculation of profit for the
intervening period, i.e., the period from the date of last balance sheet and the date
of retirement. Let us understand by way of example:

Maira, Shabnam and Vipul were partners in a firm sharing profits in the
ratio of 5:4:1 profits for the year ending  on March 31, 2019 was Rs. 1,00,000.

Vipul decides to retire on June 30, 2019. The new profit sharing ratio of the
firms is 1:1. Vipul's share of profit for the period of from April 01 to June 30,

The outgoing partner’s account is settled as per the terms of partnership deed
i.e., in lumpsum immediately or in various instalments with or without interest
as agreed or partly in cash immediately and partly in instalment at the agreed
intervals. In the absence of any agreement, Section 37 of the Indian Partnership
Act, 1932 is applicable, which states that the outgoing partner has an option to
receive either interest @ 6% p.a. till the date of payment or such share of profits
which has been earned with his/her money (i.e., based on capital ratio). Hence,
the total amount due to the retiring partner which is ascertained after all
adjustments have been made is to be paid immediately to the retiring partner.
In case the firm is not in a position to make the payment immediately, the amount
due is transferred to the retiring Partner’s Loan Account, and as and when the
amount is paid it is debited to his account. The necessary journal entries recorded
are as follows.

3.8 Adjustment of Partners’ Capitals

At the time of retirement or death of a partner, the remaining partners may
decide to adjust their capital contributions in their profit sharing ratio. In such
a situation, the sum of balances in the capitals of continuing partners may be
treated as the total capital of the new firm, unless specified otherwise. Then, to
ascertain the new capital of the continuing partners, the total capital of the firm
is divided amongst the remaining partners as per the new profit sharing ratio,
and the excess or deficiency of capital in the individual capital account’s may be
worked out. Such excess or shortage shall be adjusted by withdrawal of
contribution in cash, as the case may be, for which the following journal entries
will be recorded.

(i) For excess capital withdrawn by the partner :
Partners’ Capital A/c Dr.

To Cash / Bank A/c
(ii) For amount of capital to be brought in by the partner:

Cash / Bank A/c Dr.
To Partners’ Capital A/c

Consider the following situations:
The adjustment of the continuing partner’s capitals may involve any one of the
three ways as illustrated as follows :

1. When the capital of the new firm as decided by the partners is specified.

Illustration 14

Mohit, Neeraj and Sohan are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio
of 2 : 1 : 1. Neeraj retires and Mohit and Sohan decided that the capital of
the new firm will be fixed at Rs. 1,20,000. The capital accounts of Mohit
and Sohan show a credit balance of Rs. 82,000 and Rs. 41,000 respectively
after making all the adjustments. Calculate the actual cash to be paid off
or to be brought in by the continuing partners and pass the necessary
journal entries.

Solution

The New Profit Sharing Ratio between Mohit and Sohan = 2 : 1

Mohit Sohan

New Capital based new ratio is 80,000 40,000
Existing Capital (after adjustments) is 82,000 41,000

Asha, Deepa and Lata are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3 : 2 : 1.
Deepa retires. After making all adjustments relating to revaluation, goodwill and
accumulated profit etc., the capital accounts of Asha and Lata showed a credit
balance of Rs. 1,60,000 and Rs. 80,000 respectively. It was decided to adjust
the capitals of Asha and Lata in their new profit sharing ratio. You are required
to calculate the new capitals of the partners and record necessary journal entries
for bringing in or withdrawal of the necessary amounts involved.

Solution

a. Calculation of new capitals of the existinging partners
Balance in Asha’s Capital (after all adjustments) =  1,60,000
Balance in Lata’s Capital =     80,000
Total Capital of the New Firm =  2,40,000
Based on the new profit sharing ratio of 3:1

continuing partners in such a way that their capitals are adjusted
proportionate to their new profit sharing ratio:

Illustration 16

Lalit, Pankaj and Rahul are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 4 : 3 : 3. After
all adjustments, on Lalit’s retirement with respect to general reserve, goodwill
and revaluation etc., the balances in their capital accounts stood at Rs. 70,000,
Rs. 60,000 and Rs. 50,000 respectively. It was decided that the amount payable
to Lalit will be brought by Pankaj and Rahul in such a way as to make their
capitals proportionate to their profit sharing ratio. Calculate the amount to be
brought by Pankaj and Rahul and record necessary journal entries for the same.
Also record necessary entry for payment to Lalit.

After Lalit’s retirement, the new profit sharing ratio between Pankaj and Rahul
is 3 : 3, i.e. 1 : 1.

Solution

a. Calculation of total capital of the new firm
Balance in Pankaj’s Capital account (after adjustment) =     60,000
Balance in Rahul’s Capital account (after adjustment) =     50,000
Amount payable to Lalit (Retiring partner) =     70,000
Total capital of new firm (i) + (ii) + (iii) = 1,80,000

b. Calculation of new capitals of the continuing partners

1
Pankaj’s New Capital =  Rs. 1,80,000 × = Rs. 90,000

3.9 Death of a Partner

As stated earlier, the accounting treatment in the event of death of a partner is
similar to that in case of retirement of a partner, and that in case of death of a
partner his claim is transferred to his executors and settled in the same manner
as that of the retired partner. However, there is one major difference that, while the
retirement normally takes place at the end of an accounting period, the death of a
partner may occur any time. Hence, in case of a partner, his claim shall also
include his share of profit or loss, interest on capital, interest on drawings (if any)
from the date of the last Balance Sheet to the date of his death of these, the main
problem relates to the calculation of profit for the intervening period (i.e., the period
from date of the last balance sheet and the date of the partner’s death. Since, it is

Retirement/Death of a Partner 141

considered cumbersome to close the books and prepare final account, for the
period, the deceased partner’s share of profit may be calculated on the basis of
last year’s profit (or average of past few years) or on the basis of sales.

For example, Bakul, Champak and Darshan were partners in a firm sharing
profits in the ratio of 5:4:1. The profit of the firm for the year ending on March
31, 2017 was Rs.1,00,000. Champak died on June 30, 2017. Bakul and Darshan
decided to share profits equally. Champak’s share of profit for the period from
April 1 to June 30, 2017, shall be calculated as follows:

Total profit for the year ending on 31st March, 2017 = Rs.1,00,000

Champak’s share of profit :

Proceeding Year’s Profit × Proportionate Period × Share of Deceased Partner

3 4
= Rs. 1,00,000  ×   ×  = Rs. 10,000

The journal entry will be recorded as follows :

Profit & Loss Suspense A/c Dr. 10,000

To Champak’s Capital A/c 10,000

(Champak’s share of profit transferred to his capital account)

Alternatively, if  Champak’s share of profit was to be calculated on the basis of
average profits of the last three years, which were Rs. 1,36,000 for 2014-15,
Rs. 1,54,000 for 2015-16 and Rs. 1,00,000 for 2016-17; Champahs share of
profit for the period from April 7, 2017 to June 30, 2017 shall be calculated on
the basis of average profit based on profits for the last year calculation as follows:

Total Profit
Average Profit = Rs. 1,36,000 + Rs. 1,54,000 + Rs. 1,00,000

The Journal entry will be:

In case, the agreement provides, that share of profit of the deceased partner
will be worked out on the basis of sales, and it is specified that the sales during
the year 2015-16 were Rs. 8,00,000 and the sales from April 1, 2017 to June
30, 2017 were Rs. 1,50,000 Champak’s share of profits for the period from
April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 shall be calculated as follows.

Retirement/Death of a Partner 147

Terms Introduced in the Chapter

• Retirement of a Partner • Executors of deceased Partner
• Death of a Partner • Executor’s Account
• Gaining Ratio

Summary

1. New Profit Sharing Ratio: New profit sharing ratio is the ratio in which the
remaining partner will share future profits after the retirement or death of any
partner.

New Share = Old Share + Acquired Share from the Outgoing partner

2. Gaining Ratio: Gaining ratio is the ratio in which the continuing partners have
acquired the share from the retiring deceased partner.

3. Treatment of Goodwill: The basic rule is that gaining partner(s) shared
compensate the sacrificing partner to the extent of their gain for the respective
share of goodwill.

If goodwill already appears in the books, it will be written off by debiting all
partner’s capital account in their old profit sharing ratio.

4. Revaluation of Assets and Liabilities: At the time of retirement/death of a partner,
there may be some assets which may not have been shown at their current
values. Similarly, there may be certain liabilities which have been shown at a
value different from the obligation to be met by the firm.

Besides this, there may be unrecorded assets and liabilities which have to be
recorded.

5. Accumulated Profits or Losses: The reserves (Accumulated profits) or losses belong
to all the partners and should be transferred to capital account of all partners.

6. Retiring partner/deceased partner may be paid in one lump sum or installments
with interest.

7. At the time of retirement/death of a partner, the remaining partner may decide
to keep their capital contributions in their profit sharing ratio.

Dissolution of Partnership Firm 4

You have learnt about the reconstitution of a
partnership firm which takes place on account

of admission, retirement or death of a partner. In such
a situation while the existing partnership is dissolved,
the firm may continue under the same name if the
partners so decide. In other words, it results in the
dissolution of a partnership but not that of the firm.

(4) Death of a partner;
(5) Insolvency of a partner;
(6) Completion of the venture, if partnership is formed for that; and
(7) Expiry of the period of partnership, if partnership is for a specific period

of time;

4.2  Dissolution of a Firm

Dissolution of a partnership firm may take place without the intervention of
court or by the order of a court, in any of the ways specified later in this section.
It may be noted that dissolution of the firm necessarily brings in dissolution of
the partnership. However, dissolution of partnership would not necessarily
involve dissolution of firms.

Dissolution of a firm takes place in any of the following ways:

1. Dissolution by Agreement: A firm is dissolved :
(a) with the consent of all the partners or
(b) in accordance with a contract between the partners.

2. Compulsory Dissolution: A firm is dissolved compulsorily in the following
cases:
(a) when all the partners or all but one partner, become insolvent, rendering

them incompetent to sign a contract;
(b) when the business of the firm becomes illegal; or
(c) when some event has taken place which makes it unlawful for the partners

to carry on the business of the firm in partnership, e.g., when a partner
who is a citizen of a country becomes an alien enemy because of the
declaration of war with his country and India.

3. On the happening of certain contingencies: Subject to contract between the
partners, a firm is dissolved :
(a) if constituted for a fixed term, by the expiry of that term;
(b) if constituted to carry out one or more ventures, by the completion thereof;
(c) by the death of a partner;
(d) by the adjudication of a partner as an insolvent.

4. Dissolution by Notice: In case of partnership at will, the firm may be dissolved
if any one of the partners gives a notice in writing to the other partners,
signifying his intention of seeking dissolution of the firm.

5. Dissolution by Court: At the suit of a partner, the court may order a
partnership firm to be dissolved on any of the following grounds:
(a) when a partner becomes insane;
(b) when a partner becomes permanently incapable of performing his duties

as a partner;

Reprint 2025-26



158 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts

(c) when a partner is guilty of misconduct which is likely to adversely affect
the business of the firm;

(d) when a partner persistently commits breach of partnership agreement;
(e) when a partner has transferred the whole of his interest in the firm to a

third party;
(f) when the business of the firm cannot be carried on except at a loss; or
(g) when, on any ground, the court regards dissolution to be just and

equitable.

Dissolution of Partnership Firm 159

4.3 Settlement of Accounts
In case of dissolution of a firm, the firm ceases to conduct business and has to
settle its accounts. For this purpose, it disposes off all its assets for satisfying all
the claims against it. In this context it should be noted that, subject to agreement
among the partners, the following rules as provided in Section 48 of the
Partnership Act 1932 shall apply.
(a) Treatment of Losses

Losses, including deficiencies of capital, shall be paid :
(i) first out of profits,
(ii) next out of capital of partners, and
(iii) lastly, if necessary, by the partners individually in their profit sharing ratio.

(b) Application of Assets
The assets of the firm, including any sum contributed by the partners to make

up deficiencies of capital, shall be applied in the following manner and order:
(i) In paying the debts of the firm to the third parties;
(ii) In paying each partner proportionately what is due to him/her from the

firm for advances as distinguished from capital (i.e. partner’ loan);
(iii) In paying to each partner proportionately what is due to him on account

of capital; and
(iv) the residue, if any, shall be divided among the partners in their profit

sharing ratio.
Thus, the amount realised from assets along with contribution from partners, if
required, shall be utilised first to pay off the outside liabilities of the firm such as
creditors, loans, bank overdraft, bill payables, etc. (it may be noted that secured
loans have precedence over the unsecured loans); the balance should be applied
to repay loans made by the partners to the firm. (in case the balance amount is
not adequate enough to pay off such loans and advances, they are to be paid
propartionately). The amount left thereafter is utilised in settlement of capital
account balances. Then the surplus if any is divided among partners in their
profit sharing ratio.
Private Debts and Firm’s Debts: Where both the debts of the firm and private debts of
a partner co-exist, the following rules, as stated in Section 49 of the Act, shall apply.

(a) The property of the firm shall be applied first in the payment of debts of the
firm and then the surplus, if any, shall be divided among the partners as
per their claims, which can be utilised for payment of their private liabilities.

(b) The private property of any partner shall be applied first in payment of
his private debts and the surplus, if any, may be utilised for payment of
the firm’s debts, in case the firm’s liabilities exceed the firm’s assets.

It may be noted that the private property of the partner does not include the
personal properties of his wife and children. Thus, if the assets of the firm are
not adequate enough to pay off firm’s liabilities, the partners have to contribute
out of their net private assets (private assets minus private liabilities).

160 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts

Inability of a Partner to Contribute Towards Deficiency

In the context of settlement of accounts among the partners there is still another
important aspect to be noted, i.e., when a partner is unable to contribute towards
the deficiency of his capital account (the account finally showing a debit balance),
he/she is said to be insolvent, and the sum not recoverable is treated as capital loss
for the firm. In the absence of any agreement, to the contrary, such a capital loss is
to be borne by the remaining solvent partners in accordance with the principle laid
down in Garner vs. Murray case, which states that the solvent partners have to bear
such loss in the ratio of their capitals as on the date of dissolution. However, the
accounting treatment relating to dissolution of partnership on account of insolvency
of partners is not being taken up at this stage.

4.4 Accounting Treatment

When the firm is dissolved, its books of account are to be closed and the profit or
loss arising on realisation of its assets and discharge of liabilities is to be
computed. For this purpose, a Realisation Account is prepared to ascertain the
net effect (profit or loss) of realisation of assets and payment of liabilities which
may be is transferred to partner’s capital accounts in their profit sharing ratio.
Hence, all assets (other than cash in hand bank balance and fictitious assets, if
any), and all external liabilities are transferred to this account. It also records
the sale of assets, and payment of liabilities and realisation expenses. The balance
in this account is termed as profit or loss on realisation which is transferred to
partners’ capital accounts in the profit sharing ratio (see figure 4.1).

1. Dissolution of Partnership Firm : The dissolution of a firm implies the
discontinuance of partnership business and termination of economic relations
between the partners. In the case of a dissolution of a firm, the firm closes its
business altogether and realises all its assets and pays all its liabilities. The
payment is made to the creditors first out of the assets realised and, if necessary,
next out of the contributions made by the partners in their profit sharing ratio.
When all accounts are settled and the final payment is made to the partners
for the amounts due to them, the books of the firm are closed.

2. Dissolution of Partnership : A partnership gets terminated in case of admission,
retirement death, etc. of a partner. This does not necessarily involve dissolution
of the firm.

3. Realisation Account : The Realisation Account is prepared to record the
transactions relating to sale and realisation of assets and settlement of creditors.
