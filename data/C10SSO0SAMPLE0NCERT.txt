Why Newspapers?
Krishnaji Trimbuck Ranade inhabitant of Poona intends to publish a Newspaper in
the Marathi Language with a view of affording useful information on every topic of
local interest. It will be open for free discussion on subjects of general utility, scientific
investigation and the speculations connected with the antiquities, statistics,
curiosities, history and geography of the country and of the Deccan especially... the
patronage and support of all interested in the diffusion of knowledge and Welfare of
the People is earnestly solicited.
Bombay Telegraph and Courier, 6 January 1849

"The task of the native newspapers and political associations is identical to the role
of the Opposition in the House of Commons in Parliament in England. That is to
critically examine government policy to suggest improvements, by removing those
parts that will not be to the benefit of the people, and also by ensuring speedy
implementation.
These associations ought to carefully study the particular issues, gather diverse
relevant information on the nation as well as on what are the possible and desirable
improvements, and this will surely earn it considerable influence”.

Global pollution is rising due to rapid economic growth, population increases, and
insufficient environmental management. This poses serious health risks for people
and ecosystems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Contributing to
these challenges, the global economy relies on deeply intertwined supply chains,
sustained by more than 100 billion tons of raw materials entering the system each
year. Intensive material consumption depletes natural resources and causes
negative environmental impacts at every stage of the product lifecycle. Global waste
is expected to increase to 3.4 billion tons by 2050.
Pollution of all types hinders development outcomes. Exposure to air pollution, water
pollution, and hazardous chemicals and wastes like mercury, lead and persistent
organic pollutants (POPs) causes debilitating and fatal illnesses, creates harmful
living conditions, and destroys ecosystems. Pollution undermines sustainable
economic growth, exacerbates poverty and inequality in both urban and rural areas,
and significantly contributes to climate change. Poor people, who cannot afford to
protect themselves from the negative impacts of pollution, end up suffering the most.
Pollution is the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death. It is
estimated to be several times more deaths than from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria
combined. Global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are reminders of
the strong linkages between environment and health and of the need to address such
linkages systematically.

Sri Lanka emerged as an independent country in 1948. The leaders of the Sinhala
community sought to secure dominance over government by virtue of their majority.
As a result, the democratically elected government adopted a series of
MAJORITARIAN measures to establish Sinhala supremacy. Over the years, it
created feelings of alienation among the Sri Lankan Tamils. They felt that none of
the major political parties led by the Buddhist Sinhala leaders was sensitive to their
language and culture. As a result, the relations between the Sinhala and Tamil
communities strained over time. On the other hand, the Belgian leaders took a
different path. They recognised the existence of regional differences and cultural
diversities. Between 1970 and 1993, they amended their constitution four times to
work out an arrangement that would enable everyone to live together within the same
country.

1. Figure or Image – The identity of India came to be visually associated with the
image of Bharat Mata. This image was created by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay.
Rabindranath Tagore painted his famous image of Bharat Mata. In this painting,
Bharat Mata is portrayed as an ascetic figure; she is calm, composed, divine and
spiritual.
2. Songs – Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay wrote ‘VandeMataram’ as a hymn to
the motherland. It was included in his novel Anandmath and widely sung during the
Swadeshi Movement in Bengal.
3. Folklore – Indian folklore was revived. In late-nineteenth-century India,
nationalists began recording folk tales sung by bards and they toured villages to
gather folk songs and legends. These tales gave a true picture of traditional culture.
It helped to restore a sense of pride in our past. In Bengal, Rabindranath Tagore
himself began collecting ballads, nursery rhymes and myths, and led the movement

for folk revival. In Madras, Natesa Sastri published a massive four-volume collection
of Tamil folk tales, The Folklore of Southern India.
4.– Flag (A). During the Swadeshi movement in Bengal, a tricolour flag (red, green
and yellow) was designed. It had eight lotuses representing eight provinces of
British India, and a crescent moon, representing Hindus and Muslims.
(B). By 1921, Gandhiji had designed the Swaraj flag. It was again a tricolour (red,
green and white) and had a spinning wheel in the centre, representing the Gandhian
ideal of self-help. Carrying the flag, holding it aloft, during marches became a
symbol of defiance.
5. Re – interpretation of History – Indians began looking into the past to discover
India’s great achievements. They wrote about art and architecture, Science and
Maths, religion and culture, law, philosophy etc. Indians were asked to take pride in
India’s great achievements in the past and struggle to change the miserable
conditions of life under British rule.

2. Gandhiji’s letter to Viceroy Irwin stated eleven demands. Most of them were of
general interest but the most stirring was to abolish the salt tax imposed by the
colonial government.
3. Irwin’s unwillingness to negotiate forced Gandhiji to start his salt March which
was joined by thousands. It developed the feeling of nationalism.
4. People in different parts of the country broke salt law and manufactured salt and
demonstrated in front of government salt factories.
5. People unitedly followed Gandhiji’s words. They refused to pay taxes, revenues,
picketed liquor shops, boycotted foreign clothes, resigned from government jobs

1. In Britain the formation of the nation-state was not the result of a sudden upheaval
or revolution. The primary identities of the people who inhabited the British Isles
were ethnic ones - such as English, Welsh, Scot or Irish.
2. The Act of Union (1707) between England and Scotland resulted in the formation
of the 'United Kingdom of Great Britain' meant that England was able to impose its
influence on Scotland. Scotland's distinctive culture and political institutions were
systematically suppressed.
3. The Scottish Highlanders were forbidden to speak their Gaelic language or wear
their national dress and large numbers were forcibly driven out of their homeland.
4. The English helped the Protestants of Ireland to establish their dominance over
a largely Catholic country. Catholic revolts against British dominance were
suppressed. Ireland was forcibly incorporated into the United Kingdom in 1801.

Climate and Irrigation:

2

● Haryana and Punjab have a well-developed irrigation system (e.g., canal
irrigation from the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal), which allows for large-scale
3

commercial cultivation of rice. The climate is suitable for high-yielding
varieties, and irrigation ensures water availability.
● In contrast, Odisha has a more monsoonal climate, and while rice is grown,
the farming is often rainfed and primarily for local consumption. The lack of
large-scale irrigation systems limits its commercialization.
Economic Factors (Market Access):
● In Punjab and Haryana, rice is grown for commercial purposes to meet
national and international demand. The proximity to markets, government
procurement systems, and well-developed transport networks enable these
states to export surplus rice.
● In Odisha, rice is mostly grown for personal or local use, with less access to
large markets for profit-driven farming, making it a subsistence crop.
Farming Practices:
● In Punjab and Haryana, the use of modern farming techniques, machinery,
and high-yielding varieties supports commercial rice cultivation.
● In Odisha, rice farming is more traditional and focused on family
sustenance rather than large-scale production, which reflects the
subsistence nature of cultivation.

1. Peat - Decaying plants in swamps produce peat. Which has a low carbon and
high moisture contents and low heating capacity.
2. Lignite - is a low grade brown coal, which is soft with high moisture content. The
principal lignite reserves are in Neyveli in Tamil Nadu and are used for
generation of electricity.
3. Bituminous coal-Coal that has been buried deep and subjected to increased
temperatures. It is the most popular coal in commercial use. Metallurgical coal
is high grade bituminous coal which has a special value for smelting iron in blast
furnaces.
4. Anthracite -is the highest quality hard coal.

(1+2+

1) air pollution – Smoke is emitted by chemical and paper factories, brick kilns,
refineries and smelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in big and small factories
that ignore pollution norms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous with long-term
effects.
2) Water pollution is caused by organic and inorganic industrial wastes and
affluents discharged into rivers. The main culprits in this regard are paper, pulp,
chemical, textile and dyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and electroplating
industries that let out dyes, detergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like lead
and mercury pesticides, fertilisers, synthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and
rubber, etc. into the water bodies.
3) Thermal pollution of water occurs when hot water from factories and thermal
plants is drained into rivers and ponds before cooling.
4) Dumping of wastes specially glass, harmful chemicals, industrial effluents,
packaging, salts and garbage renders the soil useless.
5)Rain water percolates to the soil carrying the pollutants to the ground and the
ground water also gets contaminated.
6) Industrial and construction activities, machinery, factory equipment, generators,
saws and pneumatic and electric drills also make a lot of noise. (Or any other
relevant point) – Any two points
18.3 Poor people, cannot afford to protect themselves from the negative impacts
of pollution, end up suffering the most. This also leads to social disparity/inequality

Features of federalism:

2

1. There are two or more levels (or tiers) of government.
2. Different tiers of government govern the same citizens, but each tier has its own
jurisdiction in specific matters of legislation, taxation and administration.
3. The jurisdictions of the respective levels or tiers of government are specified in
the constitution. So the existence and authority of each tier of government is
constitutionally guaranteed.
4. The fundamental provisions of the constitution cannot be unilaterally changed
by one level of government. Such changes require the consent of both the levels
of government.
5. Courts have the power to interpret the constitution and the powers of different
levels of government. The highest court acts as an umpire if disputes arise
between different levels of government in the exercise of their respective
powers.
6. Sources of revenue for each level of government are clearly specified to ensure
its financial autonomy.
7. The federal system thus has dual objectives: to safeguard and promote unity of
the country, while at the same time accommodate regional diversity. Therefore,
two aspects are crucial for the institutions and practice of federalism.
Governments at different levels should agree to some rules of power sharing.
They should also trust that each would abide by its part of the agreement. An
ideal federal system has both aspects: mutual trust and agreement to live
together.

1. Education – Literacy rate among women is only 54% as compared with 76%
among men. Parents prefer to spend their resources for their sons’ education rather
than daughters.
2. Low Proportion of women in highly paid and valued jobs – Women still have
a small share in the highly paid jobs. Even if a woman works for more hours than a
man, her work is not given importance. This results in low paid and low valued jobs
for women.
3. Women are paid less than men – Despite the Equal Wages of Act women are
paid less than men, even when both do exactly the same work.
4. Preference for Son – In many parts of India parents prefer to have sons and
find ways to have the girl child aborted before she is born. This has led to decline
in child sex – ratio (927)
5. Exploitation at workplace and domestic violence – Women are exploited and
harassed at the workplace. They have to face different forms of domestic violence
at home.

1. Democracies accommodate various social divisions. For example, Belgium has
peacefully solved her ethnic problems and solved the differences.
2. All democracies usually develop a procedure to conduct competition, i.e. conduct
elections, power-sharing, etc. This reduces the possibility of tensions, due to social
divisions, turning violent or explosive.
3. Democracy teaches people to respect the differences and resolve conflicts
among different groups peacefully. In non-democratic countries, rulers either turn a
blind eye to or suppress internal differences. For example, Sri Lanka. The plus point
in democratic regime is the ability to handle social differences, divisions and
conflicts.
4. A democracy is not just a rule by majority opinion. The majority always needs to
work with the minority so that the government represents the general view.
5. A democratic government ensures that the rule by the majority does not become
autocratic in terms of religion, race or linguistic group etc. It tries to show that in
every election, different persons and groups can form a majority. It tries to see that
every citizen has a chance to be in majority at some point of time and is not barred
on the basis of birth. All these things ensured by a democratic regime lead to a
peaceful and harmonious life.

Political parties play a significant role in the effective working of a democracy. To
fill political offices and exercise political power, political parties are needed to
perform a series of functions, which are the following

5

1. Parties contest elections. Elections are fought mainly among candidates put up
by political parties.
In India, top party leaders choose candidates for contesting elections.
2. Parties put forward different policies and programmes. Political parties in a
democracy group together similar opinions, to provide a direction in which
government policies can be formulated.
3. Parties make laws for a country. Laws are debated and passed in the legislature.
4. Parties that lose elections play the role of the opposition. Opposition parties voice
their views by criticizing the government for its failure or wrong policies.
5. Parties shape public opinion. They raise and highlight issues and resolve
people’s problems. Many pressure groups are the extensions of political parties.
6. Parties provide people access to government machinery and welfare schemes.
For an ordinary citizen it is easier to approach a local party leader than a
government officer. (Any 5 points)
OR
27B

1. Most political parties do not practice open and transparent procedures for their
functioning. So there are very few ways for an ordinary worker to rise to the top
in a party.
2. Those who happen to be the leaders are in a position of unfair advantage as
they favour people close to them or even their family members.
3. In many parties in India, we see a trend of dynastic succession. The top positions
are always controlled by members of a particular family, which is unfair to other
7

members of the party, and bad for democracy.
4. This is so because people who do not have adequate experience or popular
support come to occupy positions of power.
5. More than loyalty to party principles and policies, personal loyalty to the leader
becomes more important. This tendency is seen all over the world, even in older
democracies.

28.2- The Majoritarian Government in Sri Lanka created a distrust between Tamils
and Sinhala communities which resulted in civil war. As a result, thousands of
people of both communities were killed and many families were forced to leave the
country as refugees.
28.3
1. The Constitution prescribed that the number of Dutch and French Any two
speaking ministers shall be equal in the central government.
Some special laws require the support of majority of members
from each linguistic group. Thus, no single community can make decisions
unilaterally.
2. Many powers of the central government have been given to state governments
of the two regions of the country. The state governments are not subordinate to the
Central Government.
3. Brussels has a separate government in which Dutch and French have equal
representation.
4. Apart from the Central and the State Government, there is a third kind of
Government. This 'community government' is elected by people belonging to one
language community - Dutch, French and German - speaking - no matter where
they live. This government has the power regarding cultural, educational and

● Accessible and quality public healthcare, is fundamental for maintaining, a

productive and healthy population. It reduces mortality rates, ensures the wellbeing of the workforce, and allows individuals to contribute meaningfully to the
economy. Inadequate healthcare can result in a higher burden of disease, lower
life expectancy, and economic inefficiencies.
Education and Skill Development:
● Public education systems are essential for providing equal learning opportunities
to all citizens, regardless of socioeconomic status. A well-educated population
leads to increased literacy rates, skill development, and innovation, all of which
are crucial for economic growth, reducing inequality, and fostering social
cohesion.
Sanitation and Clean Water:
● Proper sanitation and access to clean water are vital for maintaining public
health and preventing diseases such as cholera and dysentery. These services
significantly improve life expectancy, reduce healthcare costs, and increase
productivity, especially in rural or underserved areas.
Infrastructure Development:
● Public infrastructure, including roads, transportation, and energy, supports the
functioning of markets, businesses, and industries. It enhances connectivity,
stimulates economic activities, and improves the quality of life for individuals by
providing easy access to essential goods and services.

- Higher cost of borrowing from informal sources means a larger part of the earnings
of the borrowers is used to repay the loan. Hence, borrowers have less income left
for themselves (as we saw for Shyamal in Sonpur).
- In certain cases, the high interest rate for borrowing can mean that the amount to
be repaid is greater than the income of the borrower. -This could lead to increasing
debt (as we saw for Rama in Sonpur) and debt trap.
-Also, people who might wish to start an enterprise by borrowing may not do so
because of the high cost of borrowing.
-For these reasons, banks and cooperative societies need to lend more. This would
lead to higher incomes and many people could then borrow cheaply for a variety of
needs.
-They could grow crops, do business, set up small-scale industries etc. They could
set up new industries or trade in goods. Cheap and affordable credit is crucial for
