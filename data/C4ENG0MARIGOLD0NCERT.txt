Teacher's page
Unit 1
Poem: Wake up!
Story: Neha's Alarm Clock
This Unit focuses on appreciation of the beauty in nature, the magic of words and to give
children experiences in expressing their feelings. This Unit is also a listening Unit - it gives
children something to listen to as you read the poem to them. Ask children why they like the
poem and read the poem again for interesting and beautiful sounds. Begin this Unit by
pointing to the pictures and ask children what beautiful colours they see. Provide a print
rich environment.
Warm up
It is important to do warm up exercises related to the theme, like, let children stretch their
arms, exercise and jog as if to wake up wide. Relate this to the natural beauty of the morning.
Reading time
Read the chapter to the students at a stretch, giving the meanings of the new and difficult
words so that they can understand the text. Use appropriate words, expressions, phrases in
different situations. This can help you to assess the child's ability to listen with attention
for a reasonable length of time, share the main idea of the text and accelerate recall skills.
Give the children a chance to read individually.
Sharing time
Involve the class in a group reading session. Let children add meaning with voice
modulation and body gestures.
Dramatise the play for the morning assembly. Let each child express what they feel when
they have to get up in the morning.
Team time
Play memory games. You can write down ten new words from the lesson on the
blackboard. Let the children look at the words for two minutes. Ask the children to close
their eyes. You can then erase one word. The children will then open their eyes and
identify the word that has been erased.
Since breakfast is important for good health, each child could be asked what he had for
breakfast. Then ask them to give the importance of milk, lassi, butter. Let them add what
they eat will like to eat.
Discuss the importance of time and punctuality with the class. While discussing other
ways of finding time, the sun dial, shadows and position of sun can be introduced.
Environment
Create a Junior Green Brigade as a group of keen environmentalists who assist in keeping
the school green and clean; they can be actively involved in successful projects against
crackers and banning the use of polybags in the school and community. The school can
encourage cloth bags which are an attractive and environment-friendly alternative to
plastic.

Unit 2
Poem: Noses
Story: The Little Fir Tree
The main aim of this Unit is to sensitise the child and make her/him feel
happy with what she/he is or has. These expressions of inner feelings are not
to be judged/labelled but may only be heard, seen and shared by you.
Give the children practice in observation and conversation. Let them talk
freely about different type of faces and noses that they have seen. Bring the
shy child into conversation while asking questions. Talk with them about the
way they use their eyes, ears, nose and minds.
Develop the child's self-esteem and cultivate children's creativity. In the
context of a fast changing world, it is imperative that we respect the
children's wisdom and imagination.
bied
How do we behave and see ourselves and how do others see us? Do they see
us as kind, helpful or funny? Stress the three sides of a person. The one you
think you are, the one others think you are, the one you really are.
Warm up
If you have a child in your class who you feel is not very confident, invite the
little one to sit comfortably and then involve four/five children to share
something they like about her/him as a friend. With exchanges and sharing
in this way, you will very soon have a class where children relate to each
other and participate in learning.
Avoid correcting them when they are speaking. The idea is to build
confidence, and finally, fluency in speaking.
Reading time
Speaki
Step 1: Read the text aloud with voice modulation.
Step 2: Let the children read the text along with you.
Sharing time
In this Unit involve children with 'a creative time' activity, for example, let
them share with you their interest in speaking, writing, drawing (any other
art form or paper activity). They can be encouraged to use this medium to
express "Who am I? What do I want to be?" The activity helps the children to
35
Rationalised 2023-24
express their thoughts logically. They also learn to interact with each other.
Divide the class into conversation groups. Help each child to think and talk
about what he saw that morning - his father, baby sister, pet, etc. and ask
them how they feel. They can illustrate this through pictures which can be
displayed in the class.
Writing time
Help children improve their handwriting with practice but guide them by
precept and discussion.
Handwriting suggestions can be put up on a chart for the class. Some of
these can be to-
(a) make the writing even
(b) begin sentences with capital letters
(c) end the sentences with periods or question marks
(d) write the letters carefully on the line.
Creative time
shed
• Ensure that the children's running handwriting is done in their
notebooks.
From the spellings that they have learnt from this lesson, let them
construct meaningful sentences in their notebooks.
Try to teach organisational skills. Let children make a poem on their
eyes/ears, or on the peacock, our national bird, in their notebooks.
Introduce the use of 'and' and 'but through oral work to bring out the
function of addition and contrast respectively.

He began to boast, "No one

archery.
I string the bow, take aim.

Nasruddin held the bow in his hands, strung it,
aimed at the target and shot an arrow.
Wh...o...0...0...0...
The arrow didn't hit the target!
Instead it fell down somewhere in the
middle.
"Ha...ha...ha...ha..."
His friends started
laughing.
They said, "Hey,
Nasruddin! Is this
your best aim?"
"Oh, no!
Not at all," said
Nasruddin,
defending himself.
"This wasn't my aim.
It was Azad's aim.
I just showed you how
Azad shoots an arrow."

Saying this, Nasruddin picked
up another arrow.
Once again, he strung the bow, aimed at the target.

This time, the arrow fell a little further from where it
had fallen before.

They asked Nasruddin,
"And this must be

"Of course not,"
argued Nasruddin.
"Even this aim was not mine.
It was the chief guard's aim."
Now somebody remarked,
"Well...
Now who's next on
the list?"
Hearing
this, all the
friends burst
out laughing.
Nasruddin
didn't say a word.
He quietly picked up

Unit 3
Poem: Run!
Story: Nasruddin's Aim
This Unit develops concentration for the work that children are involved with.
Warm up
Before beginning the poem, the teacher can ask the children to run around the class in
silence and then-
Stand straight
1. Take a deep breath inhaling
through your nose.
2. Hold till the count of five.
3. Release the air through your nose.
4. Repeat it five times.
Reading time
Stretch their arms sideways
1. Keeping your arms stretched, bring your
hands down from the elbow level.
2. Stretch your arms sideways again.
3. Repeat it five times.
ed
While reading the lesson, the teacher can talk about concentration that leads to
success. Concentration is essential for studies as well as sports.
The teacher should read the given instructions in the questions very clearly so that the
children understand them and follow them accordingly.
Sharing time
Discuss the feelings after running.
To keep pace with the activity of running, the teacher can ask the children to read the
poem fast, imagining that they are running and reading (speed and fast-track ©).
? Having experienced the running activity, children should be encouraged to answer
the talk time correctly.
Creative time
Involve the children with words like racing, diving, jumping, swimming, running. for
example-Racing boats is a sport. A girl is diving. I am jumping. We are running a race.
They can either enact or draw to express the sense of movement (this is an indirect way
of sharing verbs as doing' words). These drawings with sight words can be hung in the
class. Teachers may lay more emphasis on the inclusion of sports and games from the
local area. They may organise special sports programmes both before and after school
hours to enable children with special talents for training. Team games such as basket
ball, kabaddi, volleyball can be encouraged.
Language corner
The lesson deals with a lot of words ending with 'ing'. The teacher should encourage the
class to use 'ing words in sentences, orally as well as in the written format.
For example:
Environment.
What are you doing?
I am speaking.
Let students express their concerns on the environmental degradation around us.

curious about or interested in. Where do they experience most things?
Answer the various questions that they would like to ask.
Tell them other stories related to curious things in the world. Tell them to read
the newspapers and talk about important events. In what areas do they get
their best ideas?
Creative time
An environment that is laced with the child's freedom to express how he thinks
the world is can be encouraged by any medium that she/he chooses, e.g...
through role play. (e.g: What do you want to be? Why?) Aesthetics (e.g..
creating rhymes, music, art, craft...).

Unit 5
Poem: Don't be Afraid of the Dark
Story: Helen Keller
This Unit is about sensitising children to the world around them, in terms of their
thoughts about fear of night, darkness etc. It is also about 'differences' in children which
emerge due to certain individual needs that may affect their learning styles.
Warm up
A blindfold game where simple, catch-the-thief. follow-the-leader games, can be
initiated, to give children a sense of joy and participation in the process of developing
sensitivity towards others.
Opportunities need to be given to all children and their specific abilities need to be
recognised and appreciated. This includes children with disabilities, who may need
assistance or more time to complete tasks.
Reading time
1. By this Unit you can now involve the children in silent reading of the lessons before
you actually start reading aloud to them. Identify a few children who could initiate a
reading session for the others. The bottom line for this Unit should be how to involve
the entire class into reading, listening and answering queries.
2. A small classwise competition within the school can be initiated.
Sharing time
1. Involve the children in sharing what they have felt during warm up time.
2. A chart about difficulties that children have in terms of their fears. I don't like.
I can't do can be put up in the class.
The idea is not only to make children do things but also to hear and understand what they
feel they can't do. This feedback will work to sensitise you with their individual needs.
Creative time
1. Emphasise on similar sounding words with different spellings e.g. bee/be, son/sun
and other words given in the text.
2. Rhyming words can also now be introduced and children can be encouraged to create
their own little poems using rhyming names in the class (names of children /name of
things in the classrooms) in alphabetical order. These can be put on a chart and
children can then make a class rhyme.
Language corner
1. The chart above can form the central point of the language corner.
2. Children can be subtly involved in making written presentations about their thoughts,
feeling and ideas about this Unit.
3. Assessment of the class based on reading, listening, writing can now start with each
child getting a feedback.
Environment
Issues related to the class, like using less paper should now be focused upon.

Teacher's page
Unit 6
Poem: Hiawatha
Story: The Scholar's Mother Tongue
The teacher's effort in this Unit is to realise that as children develop the skill of
using language, they acquire the ability to think objectively. Many factors in the
home environment affect the way a child learns language.
Help students use language to transmit and receive meaning.
• Develop in children the ability to listen effectively to communicate with others.
Give a variety of inputs in English and use the mother tongue as a resource.
Materials can be designed to promote multilingual activities, and teachers need to
work out how more than one language can be used naturally. Teachers can
introduce parallel texts in more than one language - these may be the same story
in different Indian languages to involve similar language activities such as
rhymes, sound games, etc.
Warm up

Create a class drama where some children can take up roles as mummy, papa.
dada, dadi, nana, nani. The rest of the class can go and ask them for their
favourite food/clothes/stories (this exchange in a warm-up exercise will bring
out the vibrancy of language).
Reading time
Reading is a transferable skill improvement in reading in one language
results in reading improvement in general. Try to foster correct pronunciation
and develop fluency in speech.
Sharing time: Share the story of Mowgli the boy who was brought up in the
Indian jungles with the help of Baloo the bear and Bagheera the panther and
how they have to fight the tiger Sherkhan and the animals in the jungle. If
possible let them hear the song जंगल जंगल बात चली है पता चला है चड्ढी पहन कर फूल
(the Japanese animation of Jungle Book's original story by Rudyard
Kipling was dubbed in Hindi for Doordarshan in the early 1990's).

trees, grass and ask them to write/draw what they felt.

Poem: The Donkey
This Unit further sensitises children to use the language that energises from their
natural surroundings.
Warm up
Divide the class into groups of four students each to read and discuss. While
groups are working, encourage and help students with vocabulary or any
expressions only after you have given them a chance to make their own choices.
Reading time
Repeat the instructions as given before. Encourage children to read aloud with
voice modulation. This can now be a time of class evaluation/ assessment. Let
the class be divided into four groups and each group can be assessed for reading
by the others on scales like-
1. Excellent! 2. Good
Sharing time
3. Try harder
pushed
Encourage creative writing with emphasis on self-expression, sharing ideas,
feelings, responses to experiences in their own ways.
With emphasis on observation, perception, imagination, let children be aware of
the natural world around.
Language corner
Writing pattern poems
You may help students write their own poems following the given pattern-
Line 1: Noun
Line 2: Same noun, verb, adverb 1
Line 3: Same noun, verb, adverb 1, adverb 2
Line 4: Verb, adverb 1. adverb 2. adverb 3
Line 5: Adverb 1, adverb 2, adverb 3. adverb 4
Line 6: Phrase or clause showing time or place
Children play happily
Children play happily, merrily
Play, happily, merrily, joyfully

Children will be able to write a short composition based on pictures.
Take part in group activity, role play and dramatisation.
Environment
Tabulate all that the children have done in all the Units and see to it that this is
being followed both with love and commitment. Remember, only when children
participate in caring for their environment will there be a world where language
(English or any other) would be used.

leaves. Holes were drilled through the leaves and the book
