1 The Ever-Evolving 
World of Science

We hope you enjoyed your adventures with Curiosity in 
Grade 6, and are now ready to continue our journey into the 
wonderful world of science. This again, is not just a textbook with 
facts — it is an invitation to question, to perform experiments, 
and to explore, as we try to understand the beautiful world we 
live in. The world of science covers everything — small and large, 
near and far. We may be looking at tiny cells inside a leaf, or 
the movement of the sun and the stars. We may be testing out 
the materials around us at home, or discussing how water flows 
underground. As you go through the chapters in this book, you 
will start new adventures that challenge your thinking, expand 
your knowledge, and help you become an explorer, making small 
discoveries for yourself. 

Before we dive into our exciting journey, take a moment to 
observe something special about this book. Look at the page 
numbers — they follow the playful flight of a butterfly and the 
soaring of a paper plane! Just as a butterfly flutters freely and a 
paper plane flies into the sky, learning takes flight when curiosity 
leads the way. Did you know that something as simple as a paper 
plane inspired real scientific explorations of flight? From early 
inventors studying bird wings to modern engineers designing 
aircraft, the dream of flying started with simple observations and 
experiments. So, as you turn each page, let your imagination take 
flight — exploring new ideas, discovering wonders, and reaching 
for the skies!

The Ever-Evolving World of Science



Exploration, of course, isn’t just about discovering new facts 
or learning about different things in nature. Science, as we said 
in Grade 6, is a process, so it is about a way of thinking that 
welcomes curiosity, asks questions, and is open to the unknown. 
In Grade 7, we will try to ask deeper questions: How do things 
work? Why do events happen the way they do? And what can 
we learn from the patterns that we see in nature? 

To do this, we have to step out of this book, step out of the 
classroom perhaps, and experience the world through activities 
and experiments. These are experiences that we hope will not 
just be interesting or exciting but also serve as stepping stones 
to a deeper understanding of the environment we live in and of 
our place on this planet. We believe that this will also help you 
to see science as an ongoing process of discovery. And not just 
about discovery alone, but also about responsibility. As young 
science explorers, you will soon see how human activities are 
linked to what happens in the natural world and are connected 
to the society we live in. You will, we hope, also see the role that 
science can play in addressing environmental challenges and 
help in creating a more sustainable world. 

But let’s get back into this book for now. You will read about 
topics in different fields of science, from physics and chemistry 
to biology and earth sciences. While they might appear as 
different chapters, just as we had said in Grade 6, they are 
all interconnected. Scientific ideas in one area often inspire 
discoveries in another, or at least allow us to ask questions in 
another area. So, let’s take a quick journey through our book for 
this year. We will start by looking at the properties of materials 
around us, mostly the things we experience but perhaps never 
ask questions about — why are some fruits sour? What happens 
when we wash a haldi stain on our school uniform? 

2

We then move on and play with some 

electric batteries, lamps and wires to try to 
find other kinds of properties of materials. 
What kind of materials do we need to make a 
lamp glow? This will lead us to classifying 
materials based on their properties — and we 
will enter the world of metals and non-metals. 
We know from our experience that a torch 
battery runs out eventually, and can’t be used 
again. We’ll explore what kind of changes happen around us. 
Some changes can be reversed and others cannot be reversed. 

Batteries run out, ice melts into water, fruits ripen, rocks break 
into pebbles… what kind of changes are these? Some of these 
happen, or happen faster, when things are heated. We will look 
at how heat flows — whether it is the melting of an ice cube in a 
glass, or the melting of a glacier. Water is, of course, everywhere, 
and with the heat from the Sun, it evaporates from the seas and 
falls as rain, perhaps trickling down into the ground, somewhere 
far away.  

Chapter 1.indd   3 4/3/2025   4:50:09 PM

The Ever-Evolving World of Science



However, it isn’t just changes in materials 
around us that we see, or the hidden changes in 
water that we do not see. As we are growing, our 
bodies are changing as well. Especially around 
the middle-school years, our bodies are changing 
rapidly! Why? Not just us humans, there are 
life processes that are essential to all animals 
for their survival. To grow, we have to eat and 
breathe, blood has to circulate the nutrients 
from the food all over the body and so on. But 
why animals alone? Don’t plants also need food 
to grow? How do they get their food? Do they also 
breathe? How? Over the time that life has evolved 

on our planet Earth, it has figured out how to do this in a beautiful 
and carefully balanced way. Ah, but what is time? The clock on 
the wall or a wrist watch tells us the time and how it passes. We 
get prepared to go to school in the morning and are ready to sleep 
at night but have you thought about how we measure time? And 
how fast does something happen? 

Long before the age of electric clocks and digital watches, early 
humans observed the shadows of objects in the Sun and used the 
position of the shadows to tell the time. Light and shadows are 

not just useful for shadow 
puppets or to tell the time. 
Naturally, light helps us see 
and today, we’ve developed 
a lot of ways to generate 
light (so we can read a 
book at night, even when 
the Sun doesn’t shine). But, 
more importantly, asking 
questions about the nature 

4

Chapter 1.indd   4 4/3/2025   4:50:10 PM

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

of light has given us a very deep understanding of the universe 
we live in. While we’ll perhaps learn about it only later, light and 
shadows are not just limited to things around us at home. 

Even the Earth and the Moon can cast shadows, leading to 
the fascinating phenomena of eclipses. And of course, we have 
day and night that depend on receiving light from the Sun. To 
understand all of this, we need to know how the Earth rotates 
around its axis, how the Moon goes around the Earth, and the 
Earth around the Sun. And the consequences of these movements 
on life on our beautiful planet. While all this might have your 
head spinning, think about it. Isn’t it amazing that we humans 
can wonder about the wonderful world we live in?

In the chapters that follow, you’ll 
also make simple observations and 
do fun experiments, and dive into 
topics that need careful thinking. 
Each chapter builds on what you 
already know and encourages you 
to ask questions, explore, do hands-
on experiments, and think like a 
scientist! As you will find out, even 
those experiments that seem to 
confirm what we think will happen, 
might lead to some additional 
questions that might need more 
experiments and more questions. 

1.1 Happy Exploring!

Activity 1.1: Question the Answer

In school or during tests, you’re usually given questions and 
expected to find the answers. But let’s turn that around! To think 

Chapter 1.indd   5 4/3/2025   4:50:12 PM

The Ever-Evolving World of Science



like a scientist, it is equally important to ask interesting questions! 
Great scientists don’t just answer questions — they ask amazing 
ones! (Remember last year we had said, “To be a wise person, 
you must be a whys person”.) 

Look at the answers below. Your task is to come up with a 
curious, creative, and fun question or situations that could 
lead to these answers. There are never any wrong questions, so 
let your imagination run wild! Since such exercises might not 
be very familiar, here is an example to help you! Suppose the 
answer was ‘just make it half!’ — what all could this be a response 
to? Well, it could range from “How do we ensure getting equal 
shares of cake?” to “My essay is too long”, or “I can’t fit this in 
the envelope” or even “I cannot dance to such a long song”... all 
very different! So, let’s see what kind of creative questions you 
can ask! 

Question: ________________________________________________?

Answer: Just add some milk.

Question: ________________________________________________?

Answer: Because the cat’s teeth were crooked.
Question: ________________________________________________?

Answer: Don’t panic, I have my towel.
Question: ________________________________________________?
Answer: 42

(Please ask a more interesting, and not obvious questions 
like “What is 32+10?”, or even “What is the answer to life, the 
universe, and everything?”)

Exploring 
2 Substances: Acidic, 

Basic, and Neutral
On 28 February, the school hosted a science fair to celebrate 
National Science Day. At the entry gate, siblings Ashwin and 
Keerthi were greeted with a white sheet of paper. They were 
curious to know why a white sheet of paper was given to them!

A few steps ahead, there was a volunteer spraying a liquid 
on these sheets of paper. The siblings also got their white sheets 
sprayed. To their surprise, the words ‘Welcome to the Wonderful 
World of Science’ appeared on the papers the moment the liquid 
was sprayed (Fig. 2.1). They were excited and eager to know how 
this happened and the reason behind it.

Their curiosity was partly satisfied at the ‘Colourful World 
of Substances’ stall. They saw many activities showing colour 
changes on mixing different substances. They decided to explore 
these changes further. Let us join them on this learning adventure.

Fig. 2.1: Scene of a science fair




2.1 Nature — Our Science Laboratory

2.1.1 Litmus as an indicator
Activity 2.1: Let us explore

 Collect samples of lemon juice, soap solution, amla juice, 
tamarind water, vinegar, baking soda solution, lime water, 
tap water, washing powder solution, sugar solution, and salt 
solution.

 Take a strip of blue litmus paper 
and cut it into small pieces.

 Spread these pieces on a clean 
and dry white tile.

 Using a dropper, put one drop of 
each of the samples, one-by-one, 
on these litmus paper pieces, as 
shown in Fig. 2.2a.

Fig. 2.2(a): Colour change in 
blue litmus paper

 Do you observe any change 
in the colour of the blue 
litmus pieces?

 Record your observations 
in Table 2.1.

 Repeat the same activity 
with pieces of red litmus 
paper as shown in 
Fig.  2.2b and record your Fig. 2.2(b): Colour change in 

red litmus paper
observations in Table 2.1.

How to prepare lime water?
Do not confuse lime water with the word lime, which is a fruit 
similar to lemon.

Lime water (solution of calcium hydroxide in water) can be 
easily prepared by mixing lime (chuna, i.e. calcium oxide) in water 
and leaving it undisturbed for some time, say an hour. Filter the 
liquid into another container and use it as lime water.

Now, let us analyse Table 2.1 and sort the samples into 
three groups as follows —
 Group A with samples that turn the blue litmus paper to red. 
 Group B with samples that turn the red litmus paper to blue. 
 Group C with samples that do not affect either of the two 

litmus papers.
Record the data in Table 2.2.

I am curious to know — what are these 
red and blue litmus paper strips made of? 
Why do they change colour when drops 
of some samples are put on them?

Fig. 2.3: Blue and red litmus 
Let us find out! paper strips
Litmus is a natural substance obtained from lichens. It is 
available  both as a solution and in the form of paper strips, 
known as litmus paper. The litmus paper is available in two 
colours—blue and red, as shown in Fig. 2.3. 

Substances that turn blue litmus paper to red are acidic in 
nature, while those that turn red litmus paper to blue are basic
in nature. Since litmus shows different colours in acidic and basic 
solutions, it is called an acid-base indicator.

Some other substances, both natural and synthetic, can 
also be used as indicators. Synthetic indicators are made in 
laboratories, and you will learn more about them in higher 
grades.

HOLISTIC LENS
Lichens are formed by the association of two 
living organisms, a fungus and an alga. They grow 
on rocks and trees in regions that have abundant 
rainfall and clean air. Do you find lichens on trees 
in your neighbourhood?

Lichens

Now, let us classify the substances sorted in Group A, Group B, 
and Group C in Table 2.2.
 The substances in Group A, such as lemon juice, amla juice, 

tamarind water, and vinegar turned the blue litmus paper to 
red, implying that these substances are acidic in nature. 

 The substances in Group B, such as soap solution, baking 
soda solution, lime water, and washing powder solution 
turned the red litmus paper to blue. Hence, these substances 
are basic in nature. 

 The substances in Group C, such as tap water, sugar solution, 
and salt solution, did not change the colour of either litmus 
paper. Can you predict their nature?

These substances are said to be neutral because they are 
neither acidic nor basic.

Activity 2.2: Let us relate and explore

Are all the substances in Group A of Table 2.2 edible? Have you 
ever tasted these edible substances? Can you recall their taste? 
You will find that all these substances taste sour. Thus, we can 
say that substances that taste sour tend to contain acids and are 
acidic in nature.
Caution — Do not taste anything until asked to do so. Do not taste any 
unknown substance.

Some common edible substances and the names of the most 
common acids present in them are given in Fig. 2.4.

Citric acid

Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) 
and Citric acid

Tartaric acid

Citric acid and Oxalic acid

Fig. 2.4: The most common acids present in some edible substances
Find out and write the names of the most common acids 

present in the following substances —
Lemon________, Curd________, Tamarind________, Vinegar________.

Now, let us take one of the substances — baking soda 
solution — from Group B. Rub the baking soda solution between 
your fingers. What do you observe? 

It feels soapy or slippery. Basic substances are generally 
slippery to touch.

Also, bases generally taste bitter, but Now, I can check 
everything that tastes bitter may not the nature of floor 
contain a base. For example, bitter gourd cleaning liquid using 
(karela) possesses a bitter taste but is not an indicator! 
basic in nature.

If litmus is not available, are there 
some other natural substances 
that can serve as acid-base 
indicators?

2.1.2 Red rose as an indicator
You might have observed many coloured flowers in your 
surroundings. Try making your indicators using these flowers.

Activity 2.3: Let us prepare 

 Collect some fallen petals of 
red roses available in your 
surroundings (Fig.  2.5). It is 
advised not to pluck flowers. You 
may pick petals or flowers fallen 
on the ground.

 Take a fistful of the collected 
petals of red roses and wash 
them with water. 

 Crush the petals using a mortar Fig. 2.5: Red roses

the crushed flower petals are completely immersed.

Caution — Perform this step under the supervision of an adult.
 Cover the glass tumbler with a lid. Wait for 5 – 10 minutes till 

the water becomes coloured (Fig. 2.6), and filter it.
 The filtrate (liquid after filtration) is the required flower 

extract (Fig. 2.7) to be used as an acid-base indicator.

Discuss your observations with your classmates.
 Are the samples that change the colour of the flower extract 

to a shade of red the same as those that changed the colour 
of blue litmus paper to red? (Group A, Table 2.2)

 Are the samples that change the colour of the flower extract 
to a shade of green the same as those that changed the colour 
of red litmus paper to blue? (Group B, Table 2.2)

 Are the samples that do not change the colour of the flower 
extract the same as those that did not change the colour of 
red and blue litmus papers? (Group C, Table 2.2)

From the above activity, we can conclude that the red rose 
extract can also be used to test the nature of the substances; 
hence, it is another example of an acid-base indicator. We can 
conclude that the red rose extract seems to give red colour in an 
acidic solution and green colour in a basic solution.

Can you now fill in the nature of the substances in Table 2.3?

 Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral



We are sure that you will be excited about the above results. 
You may repeat the process of preparing the extract and testing 
substances with some vegetables, fruits, or flowers, such as 
beetroot, purple cabbage, turmeric, Indian blackberry (jamun), 
and red hibiscus (gudhal) flower. They can also act as acid-base 
indicators.

FASCINATING FACTS
Hydrangea is a plant that 
grows in cooler climates in 
the Himalayan region and the 
North-eastern states. It gives 
flowers of different colours, 
depending on the nature of the 
soil. Acidic soil produces blue-
coloured flowers, whereas 
in basic soil, the flowers are Hydrangea flowers
pink or red. Can gardeners alter the colour of hydrangea flowers by 
adjusting the acidic or basic nature of the soil?

2.1.3 Turmeric as an indicator
We have used blue and red litmus paper strips in Activity 2.1. Can 
you also make paper strips with some other natural indicators? 
Find out by performing the following activity.

Activity 2.5: Let us prepare
 Take a spoonful of turmeric (haldi) in a petri dish or container 

and add a little water to make a paste (Fig. 2.9a). You may 
also grind a piece of fresh turmeric.

 Carefully dip a piece of filter paper in the turmeric paste 
until it gets yellow colour.

 Take it out and allow it to dry.
 Cut this yellow paper into thin strips, which are used as 

‘turmeric paper’ (Fig. 2.9b).
Caution — Perform this step under the supervision of an adult.

 Using a dropper, put a drop of each of the samples used in 

Activity 2.1, one by one, on separate pieces of turmeric paper.
 Record your observations in Table 2.4.

substances? Discuss your 
observations with your classmates.

Based on the observations, we can conclude that turmeric 
paper can be used to test basic substances. However, it cannot 
differentiate between acidic and neutral substances.

FASCINATING FACTS
Why is turmeric known as a ‘Golden’ spice?

Turmeric is a member of the ginger family, 
which is grown in India and other countries. 
A common spice in daily households, it is being 
researched for benefits beyond the taste and 
colour it provides to the food! In the Ayurvedic Turmeric (Haldi)
system of medicine, turmeric is considered to have numerous health 
benefits, and is commonly used in several traditional home remedies.

Ashwin created a greeting card to pay gratitude to his teacher 
on the day of Guru Purnima. He applied turmeric paste on white 

paper and dried it. He wrote 
his wishes in the teacher's 
mother tongue (Odia 
language) on the dried paper 
using one of the solutions 

I respect my teacher as she nurtured tested in Table  2.4. Which 
curiosity within me and bestowed solution can be used to write 
upon me the gift of learning. I bow the message? His teacher

of this concept.

Are there any substances 
whose odours change on 
adding acidic or basic 
substances?

There are some substances whose odours change in an acidic 
or basic medium. These are called olfactory indicators. 
Let us explore more!

Activity 2.6: Let us investigate

 Take some finely chopped onions in a container, along with 
some strips of clean cotton cloth or filter paper.

 Tightly close the container and leave it overnight.
 Take two of the cotton cloth or filter paper strips from the 

container and check their odour.
 Keep them on a clean surface and put a few drops of 

tamarind water on one strip and a few drops of baking soda 
solution on the other. Allow the drops to spread on the strips.

 Check the odour again.
 Do you notice any change in the odour of the onion strips 

before and after putting tamarind water and baking soda 
solution on them?

 Note your observations. 
 Similarly, test the change in the odour with other acidic and 

basic substances and record your observations.

KNOW A SCIENTIST
Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray (P.C. Ray) is known as the 
‘Father of Modern Indian Chemistry’. He earned a doctorate 
in chemistry from the United Kingdom and returned to 

India. He contributed towards advancing 
scientific research in India. He also 
established India’s first pharmaceutical 
company (a  company in the field of 
medicines) in 1901. He was a person rooted 
in Indian culture and knowledge traditions. 
Through his writings on the history of 
chemistry in India, he highlighted the 
achievements and expertise of ancient 

Indian scientists to the modern world. Ray, a social reformer, 
also advocated the use of the mother tongue as a medium of 
instruction in educational institutions.

2.2  What Happens When Acidic Substances 
Mix with Basic Substances?

Let us investigate by performing the following experiment.

Activity 2.7: Let us experiment

 Take one drop of lemon juice in a test tube and 
add around twenty drops of water to it. Observe 
the colour.

 Add a drop of blue litmus solution to it. Fig. 2.10(a): The colour of the

 Slowly add drops of lime water to this test tube with 

the help of a dropper and swirl it well. 
 What do you observe? Is there any change in the 

colour of the solution?
 A stage comes when the colour of the solution 

changes from red to blue (Fig. 2.10b).
 Again, add one drop of lemon juice to the above 

solution.
Can you predict why there is a change in colour? Fig. 2.10(b): The colour of the 

solution on adding lime water

Chapter 2.indd   17 4/3/2025   4:50:52 PM

 Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral



Initially, when a drop of blue litmus solution is added to the 
lemon juice solution, the colour of the solution turns red. When 
lime water is added to this test tube, the colour of the solution 
eventually changes from red to blue. This shows that the solution 
in the test tube is no longer acidic. Lime water has neutralised 
the effect of the acid.

When the solution of an acid is mixed with the solution of a 
base in sufficient quantity, we find that the resulting solution is 
neither acidic nor basic. Such reactions are called neutralisation
reactions. In a neutralisation reaction, salt and water are formed 
with the evolution (i.e., release) of heat. 

Acid + Base → Salt + Water + Heat
There are many examples in everyday life where you can 

observe the use of neutralisation processes.
Let us find out!

  2.3 Neutralisation in Daily Life
Situation 1: Keerthi was observing a butterfly in 
the garden with her hand resting on a tree trunk. 
Suddenly, a red ant bit her, leaving her skin red 
with stinging pain (Fig. 2.11). Her brother helped 
her by applying moist baking soda to the affected 
area, which relieved the pain. What do you think 
might be the reason for this? 

When an ant bites, it injects an acidic liquid 
(formic acid) into the skin. The effect of the acid 
can be neutralised by rubbing moist baking soda, 
which is a base.

Fig. 2.11: Stinging effect What remedies do people use to treat ant bites 
of an ant bite in your region? 

Situation 2: On the Farmer’s Portal (an 
online platform from the Department of 
Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers 
Welfare), a query from a farmer states, “My 
plants are not growing well lately”. After 
a detailed discussion, it was found that 
the excessive use of chemical fertilisers 
(substances added to soil to help plants 
grow better) made the soil acidic. What 
remedy might be provided to him? 

When the soil is too acidic, the plants 
Fig. 2.12: Neutralising the acidic do not grow well. It can be treated with 

nature of soil lime, which is a base. (Fig. 2.12).
18

Chapter 2.indd   18 4/3/2025   4:50:53 PM

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7



19
If the soil is basic, organic matter like manure and composted 

leaves are added to it. Organic matter releases acids that 
neutralise the basic nature of the soil.

Sometimes, the soil may be neutral, but the plants growing in 
it may still show poor health, which can be due to the deficiency 
of nutrients in the soil.
Situation 3: Ashwin’s friend Gurbir stays near an industrial area. 
He shared with him that the fish population in his neighbourhood 
lake was declining day by day! What do you think might be the 
causes for this? It may be due to factory waste being released 
into the lake. 

If the factory waste is acidic in nature, what could be done to 
save the fish in the lake? 

The factory waste can be neutralised by adding basic 
substances before releasing into the lake.
Let us wrap up!
Now, can you explain why the words ‘Welcome to the Wonderful 
World of Science’ appeared on Ashwin and Keerthi’s paper sheets 
when the liquid was sprayed on them? 

Do you think that one possibility could be using a turmeric 
solution for the spraying liquid and a soap solution for writing 
on the paper?

In a Nutshell

 Substances around us may be classified as acidic, basic, and 
neutral in nature. 

 Extracts of lichen, red rose, red hibiscus, purple cabbage, 
turmeric, etc., can be used to indicate the nature of substances.

 Substances that show different colours in acidic and basic 
solutions are called acid-base indicators.  

 Acids turn the colour of blue litmus to red. Bases turn the 
colour of red litmus to blue. 

 Extract of red rose gives red colour in acidic solutions and 
green colour in basic solutions. 

 The yellow colour of turmeric turns red in basic solutions 
but remains unchanged in acidic and neutral solutions.

 An acid and a base neutralise each other, forming salt and 
water, along with the evolution of heat.

 Many day-to-day problems like a red ant bite, acidic or basic 
nature of soil, and industrial waste can be attempted to be 
managed by the process of neutralisation.

Electricity: 
3 Circuits and their 

Components
Nihal and his classmates were excited for their school trip to the 
Bhakra Nangal Dam. There they would visit the hydroelectric 
power house where the force of falling water was used to generate 
electricity. They also looked forward to the free 13 kilometre- 
train ride from Nangal in Punjab to Bhakra in Himachal Pradesh, 
along the beautiful Sutlej river and through the Shivalik hills.

Prior to the trip, Nihal and his classmates were given a group 
assignment to prepare a presentation on the uses of electricity. 
They began by looking around their houses, then their school, 
followed by their neighbourhood, their city, and finally they 
searched the internet. To their astonishment, their list kept 
growing. They decided to organise the uses under different 
headings.

Cooking Lighting Transportation Heating and Cooling
Electric kettle, mixer Homes, offices, Train, bus, Fan, room heater, 

grinder, toaster, streets, markets,  car, scooter, immersion rod, geyser, 
oven, microwave, factories, lift, escalator, refrigerator, air

Chapter 3.indd   23 4/3/2025   4:51:22 PM



Can you help Nihal by adding some more uses to his lists? 
Also, suggest some other ways of grouping the uses of electricity.

We use electricity all the time, so let us learn something more 
about electricity. You have learnt earlier that electricity is 
generated in multiple ways — by windmills, by using wind 
energy, by solar panels capturing the Sun’s energy, by falling 
water and by using natural gas or coal (in the chapter ‘Nature’s 
Treasures’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity). The electric 
supply from these sources reaches our homes and factories via 
wires. For example, at home we plug in various devices to the 
electrical sockets in the wall. However, to learn about electricity, 
we will focus on a portable source of electricity that most of us 
may have used. Let us start with its use in a common device like 
a torchlight.
Caution — The danger signs on electric poles and 
other appliances warn people that electricity can 
be dangerous if not carefully handled. Never ever 
perform experiments with power supply at your 
home or school. Even electricity from portable 
generators can be dangerous. Use only batteries or 
cells, like those in torchlights, wall clocks, radios, or 
remotes, for experiments with electricity.

3.1 A Torchlight
You might have used a torchlight, also called a torch or a flashlight.

Activity 3.1: Let us explore

 Take a torchlight similar to the one shown in Fig. 3.1.
 Observe it carefully. Do you notice a lamp? And a switch?
 Slide its switch and observe. Does the torch lamp glow?
 Now slide the switch back to its original position and observe 

the torch lamp.
Fig. 3.1: A torchlight You might have noticed that in the first position of the switch, 

the torch lamp glows and in the other position the lamp does not 
glow.
 Now, open the torchlight. What do you find inside?

Inside the torchlight, you may find two or more electric cells. 

Why does the torch lamp 
glow in one position of 
its switch?

3.2 A Simple Electrical Circuit
To understand how a torch works, let us first find out about its 
components.

3.2.1 Electric cell
Activity 3.2: Let us observe Positive Negative 

terminal terminal
 Take an electric cell, turn it around and look at 

it carefully (Fig. 3.2). Do you notice a positive 
(+) sign and a negative (–) sign marked on the 
electric cell? Do you also notice that it has a 
small protruding metal cap on one side and a 
flat metal disc on the other side? Fig. 3.2: An electric cell

All electric cells have two terminals; one is called positive (+ ve) 
while the other is negative (– ve). The metal cap is the positive
terminal of the electric cell and the metal disc is the negative
terminal. The electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy.

3.2.2 Battery In a torch, we generally 
use more than one cell. 

Activity 3.3: Let us experiment Are those placed in any 
particular order?

 Take a torch which uses two cells. Open its cell compartment 
and take out the cells.

 Put the cells back in a different order. Also, try reversing 
the direction of one cell. Then, slide the switch and check 
whether the lamp glows in each case. 

 Check the order in which the cells were placed in the torch 
when the lamp glows. 

The lamp glows when the cells are placed in the order as 
shown in Fig. 3.3. Notice how the terminals of the two cells are 
connected. The positive terminal of one cell is connected to the 
negative terminal of the next cell. Such a combination of two or 
more cells is called a battery.

Fig. 3.3: A battery made up of (a) two cells (b) four cells

Chapter 3.indd   25 4/3/2025   4:51:26 PM

Electricity: Circuits and their Components



For many devices, we may need more than one cell. So, 
we connect two or more cells together as shown in Fig. 3.3. 
Connecting more than one cell provides energy to the circuit for 
a longer time and/or more energy. 

FASCINATING FACTS
The term battery is also used for a single cell. We use the term battery 
even for the single cell that powers our mobile phones.

3.2.3 Electric lamp
Incandescent Lamp

Activity 3.4: Let us observe

Glass bulb Filament For this activity, you will require a torchlight with an 
incandescent lamp (or light bulb). Many old torchlights 
still use such lamps. With your teacher’s help, confirm 
that your torchlight uses an incandescent lamp.

Metal tip The thin wire inside the glass bulb of the lamp glows. 
(one terminal) The glowing thin wire is called the filament of the lamp. 

(a)
 Take out the lamp with the help of your teacher and 

inspect it from all sides. How is the filament fixed?
The filament is attached to two thicker wires that 

support it, as shown in Fig. 3.4a. One thick wire connects 
to the metal case at the lamp’s base, while the other 
connects to the metal tip at the centre of the base (Fig. 
3.4b). These form the two terminals of the lamp, and 
are fixed in a way that they do not touch each other. 
In such incandescent lamps, the filament gets hot and 

(b) glows to produce light.

LED Lamp
Many torches in use today have a Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamp, 
instead of an incandescent lamp, as shown in Fig. 3.5. 

LED lamp

Fig. 3.5: An LED lamp for torch

Activity 3.5: Let us observe

 Take an LED of any colour (Fig. 3.6) and 
observe. Do you see any filament inside it?

 Notice the length of two wires attached to + - + - + - + -
the LED. Do you find one of those longer + -
than the other?

Unlike incandescent lamps, LEDs do not 
have filaments (Fig. 3.6). They also have two 
terminals, but one is positive (attached to a 
longer wire) and the other is negative (the 
shorter wire). A torch may use one or more Fig. 3.6: LEDs of different colours
LEDs, sometimes of different shapes, in its 
lamp.

After having learnt about the electric cell, battery, and electric 
lamps, we are now ready to make the torch lamp glow using an 
electric cell or battery.

3.2.4 Making an electric lamp glow using an 
electric cell or battery

Activity 3.6: Let us construct

 Take an electric cell, an incandescent lamp used in a torch, a 
cell holder, a lamp holder, and four lengths of electric wire.

 Remove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of 
each wire to expose the metal.

 Attach two wires to the two ends of the cell holder as shown 
in Fig. 3.7a.

 Insert the cell in the holder such that its negative terminal 
is towards the spring side of the holder (Fig. 3.7b). In case a 
cell holder is not available, fix the two wires to the cell using 
electrical tape (Fig. 3.7c).

 Attach two wires to the screws of the lamp holder as shown 
in Fig. 3.8a. Fix the lamp in the holder by turning it around in 
the holder (Fig. 3.8b). In case a lamp holder is not available, 
use electrical tape to attach two wires to the two ends of the 
lamp (Fig. 3.8c).

Now, we are ready to connect the cell to the lamp to make it glow.
 We will conduct this activity in two parts — prediction and 

observation. Some of the ways in which the lamp and the cell 
can be connected are shown in Table 3.1. 
 Predict, for each arrangement, if the lamp will glow or 

not and write your prediction in Table 3.1.
 Now, connect the lamp and the cell, and observe if the 

lamp glows or not. Note down your observation in Table 
3.1. Also, for the lamps which glow, colour their glass 
bulbs yellow.

The lamp glows in the arrangements at S.No. 1 and 6 and does 
not glow in the remaining arrangements. Now, carefully look at 
the arrangements in which the lamp glows. Compare these with 
those in which the lamp does not glow. Can you find the reason 
for the difference?

3.2.5 An electrical circuit
The lamp glows when one terminal of the lamp is connected to 
one terminal of the electric cell and the other terminal of the 
lamp to the other terminal of the cell as shown in Fig. 3.9. This 

setup forms an electrical circuit, which provides a 
complete path for electric current to flow through 
the lamp. The lamp glows only when current passes 
through the circuit.

The direction of electric current in an electrical 
circuit is taken to be from the positive to the negative 
terminal of the electric cell. When the terminals of 
the lamp are connected with those of the electric cell 
by wires, the current passes through the filament 
of the incandescent lamp and makes it glow. With 
an incandescent lamp, it does not matter which of 
its terminals connects to the positive or negative 
terminal of the cell. The lamp will glow as long as 

Fig. 3.9: An electrical circuit the circuit is complete and current flows through 
the filament.

FASCINATING FACTS
Sometimes, an incandescent lamp does not glow even when 
connected to a cell. We say the lamp has ‘fused’ usually due to 
a broken filament. A broken filament stops the flow of current, 
preventing the lamp from glowing.

Let us now try to make an LED glow.
Activity 3.7: Let us experiment

 Take two electric cells, an LED of any colour, a cell holder 
that can fit two cells (Fig. 3.8a), and two lengths of electric 
wire.

 Remove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of 
each wire to expose the metal.

 Connect the two wires to the cell holder as shown in 
Fig. 3.10a. 

30

Chapter 3.indd   30 4/3/2025   4:51:32 PM

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7



31
 Insert two cells in the holder, taking care 

that for each cell, its negative terminal 
is towards the spring side of the holder 
(Fig. 3.10b) and the battery is ready to use. 
How will you decide which is the positive + –
terminal of this battery?

The terminal of the holder which is connected 
to the positive terminal of one cell is positive 
and the one connected to the negative terminal 
of the other cell is the negative terminal.
 Now, connect the free end of the battery 

positive terminal wire to the longer wire of (a) (b)
LED, and the free end of the second wire to 
the shorter wire of LED (Fig. 3.10c). Does the 
LED glow?

 Repeat the above step but interchange the + – – +
wires connected to the LED (Fig. 3.10d). 
Does the LED glow again?

You would have observed that the LED glows + – + –
in the first case (Fig. 3.10c) and does not glow in 
the other (Fig. 3.10d). It is because the current 
can pass through the LED in one direction only. 
The current passes through the LED only when 
the positive terminal (longer wire) of the LED is 
connected to the positive terminal of the battery, 
and negative terminal (shorter wire) of the LED 
is connected to the negative terminal of the (c) (d)
battery. When current passes through the LED, 
it glows. Always take care to connect an LED Fig. 3.10: Making an LED glow
correctly in a circuit to make it glow.

Sometimes you may come across a device in which the cells are placed 
side by side. Then, how are the terminals of the cells connected?

If you carefully look inside DIVE
EEPER

the battery compartment, you 
will usually see a thick wire 
or metal strip connecting the 
positive terminal of one cell 
to the negative terminal of 
the next. To help with proper 
placement, ‘+’ and ‘–’ symbols 
are typically printed inside.

3.2.6 Electric switch How does a switch turn 
Let us first make a simple on or off the torchlight?
switch on our own.

Activity 3.8: Let us construct

 Collect two drawing pins, a safety pin (or a 
paper clip), two wires, and a small piece of 
cardboard.

(a)  Insert a drawing pin through the ring of the 
safety pin and fix it to the cardboard piece, 
ensuring that the safety pin can rotate freely 
(Fig. 3.11a).

 Fix the second drawing pin to the cardboard 
piece so the free end of the safety pin can 

(b) touch it (Fig. 3.11b).
Fig. 3.11: A switch  Connect a wire to each drawing pin — our 

(a) in ‘OFF’ position
(b) in ‘ON’ position switch is ready!

Let us now test our switch.
Activity 3.9: Let us test

 Connect the electric cell, lamp, and switch 
as shown in Fig. 3.8a. Does the lamp glow?

 Rotate the free end of the safety pin till it 
touches the other drawing pin as shown in 
Fig. 3.8b. Does the lamp glow now?

When the safety pin touches both drawing 
(a) pins, it closes the gap and completes the path, and 

allows the current to flow. We call this the ON
position (Fig. 3.8b) where the circuit is closed 
and current flows from the cell’s positive to 
negative terminal making the lamp glow. When 
the safety pin does not touch the second drawing 
pin, the gap in the circuit prevents current flow, 
and the lamp does not glow. In this OFF position 
(Fig. 3.8a), we say that the circuit is open.

Note that a switch can be placed anywhere in 
(b) a circuit. A switch is a simple device that either 

completes or breaks a circuit. The switches used

for electrical and electronic parts. Using the same 
symbols across the world helps people from different 
countries and industries understand each other easily. 

3.4 Electrical Conductors and Insulators

Why did we use metal wires for 
making electric circuits? Can we 
not use some other materials for 
wires?

Also, why are electric wires 
covered with plastic or 
rubber?

34

Suppose, we make wires of materials other than 
metal and use them for making the electrical 
circuit. Do you think the electric current will 
pass through those materials in such a circuit?

Activity 3.11: Let us identify

 Connect an electric cell and a lamp while 
leaving the two ends of wires free as shown (a)
in Fig. 3.15a. 

 Touch the two free ends of the wires 
momentarily. Does the lamp glow? If yes, 
our tester is ready. We can use this tester 
to identify the materials through which 
electric current passes.

 Collect objects of different materials, such 
as metal spoons, coins, cork, rubber, glass, 
keys, pins, plastic scale, wooden block, (b)
aluminium foil, candle, sewing needle, 
cardboard, paper, and pencil lead. Fig. 3.15: (a) Conduction tester 

 One by one, touch the free ends of the tester’s (b) Using the conduction tester for 
wires to both ends of each object you have testing a material

other. Does the lamp glow every time?

 Analyse your observations. Did the lamp glow for all 
materials?

The lamp glows for some materials only. This means that 
electric current can pass easily through some materials but not 
through others. The materials through which electric current 
can flow easily are called good conductors, or conductors of 
electricity. The materials through which current cannot pass 
through are called insulators, or poor conductors of electricity. 
 Based on the observations you have recorded in Table 3.3, 

conclude which materials are conductors of electricity and 
which are insulators. Note it in Table 3.3.

From your conclusions in Table 3.3, you would have realised 
that metals are conductors of electricity, and thus, are used for 
making wires. 

DIVE
EEPER Silver, copper, and gold are the best electrical conductors. 

However, for making electrical wires, mainly copper is used 
due to its comparatively lower cost and abundant supply. 
Different types of electrical wires are used for different uses.

From Table 3.3, you would have also realised that plastic, 
rubber, and ceramics are electrical insulators. Have you now 
understood why wires are covered with those materials?

Conductors and insulators are both important. Electrical 
wires, switches, connectors of plugs, and sockets are made of 
conductors. Insulators like rubber, plastics, and ceramics are 
used to cover wires, plug tops, and switches to protect people 
from electric shocks.
Caution — Our body is a conductor of electricity. Electric current 
passing through our body may cause severe injury or even death.
Always handle electrical appliances with care. Never touch switches or 
plugs with wet hands, or use electrical devices in wet areas, or handle 
equipment with damaged insulation or broken plugs.

DIVE
EEPER Have you ever wondered how the electricity from a cell or 

battery is different from the electricity coming from a wall 
socket? Electricity from batteries usually powers small

In a Nutshell

 An electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy.
 An electric cell has two terminals; one is called positive (+ve) 

while the other is negative (–ve).
 In an incandescent electric lamp, there is a thin wire called 

the filament, which gets hot and glows to produce light when 
electric current passes through it.

 An LED has two terminals, one is positive (attached to a 
longer wire) and the other is negative (the shorter wire).

 Electric current can pass through LED in one direction only.
 An LED lights up only when its positive terminal (longer 

wire) connects to the positive terminal of the battery and 
its negative terminal (shorter wire) connects to the negative 
terminal of the battery.

 A switch is a simple device that either completes or breaks a 
circuit.

 The direction of electric current in a closed electrical circuit 
is taken to be from the positive to the negative terminal of 
the electric cell. 

 A representation of an electrical circuit using symbols is 
called its circuit diagram.

 Materials through which electric current can flow easily are 
called good conductors or conductors of electricity. ENQUIRY

 Materials through which current cannot pass through are 
called insulators or poor conductors of electricity.

The World of Metals 
4 and Non-metals

Yashwant and Anandi live in a village in Rajasthan. Their school 
has assigned them a project to learn about craftspersons who 
work with metals. They decide to visit the local ironsmiths who 
practise this craft. Yashwant and Anandi request their grandfather 
to accompany them (Fig. 4.1). They are curious to learn how these 
ironsmiths make different items of daily use. They interact with 
an elderly craftsperson, Sudarshan uncle. 
Yashwant: Which items do you generally make?
Sudarshan: Generally, we make items of daily use, such as flat 
pans (tawas), buckets (baltis), tongs (chimtas), and farming tools 
like spades (phawras), axes (kulhadis), trowels (khurpis), and 
rakes (jelees). 
Anandi: What materials are they made of?

 Fig. 4.1: Ironsmith making various items

Chapter 4.indd   41 4/3/2025   4:52:08 PM



Sudarshan: We use iron metal to make these items. We also use 
wood to prepare handles wherever required. Additionally, we 
use coal in our furnaces to heat the iron.
Sudarshan is heating an iron block in the furnace. It has become 
red hot. He starts beating it hard with a hammer.
Anandi is amazed and asks, “Why are you beating it?” 
Sudarshan: I am beating it to shape it into an axe.
Anandi: Wow, a piece of iron can be beaten into a flat shape! Can 
we do this with other metals as well?
You may also have many such questions — let us explore what 
else we can do with metals.

4.1 Properties of Materials

4.1.1 Malleability
Activity 4.1: Let us explore

Caution— Conduct this activity under the supervision of your teacher 
or an adult.
 Collect some waste pieces of copper and aluminium, an iron 

nail, a piece of coal, a pea-sized lump of sulfur (gandhak), 
and a block of wood.

 Recall the chapter ‘Materials Around Us’ in the Grade 6 
Science textbook Curiosity and observe the appearances of 
the above items. Are they lustrous? Also, note whether they 
are hard or soft and record  your observations in Table 4.1.

 Now, place each of these 
items one by one on any 
hard surface and beat them 
with a hammer (Fig. 4.2). 

 What do you think will 
happen? Do the objects 
become slightly flattened or 
do they break into pieces? 

 Record your observations in 
Table 4.1.

objects or materials

Appearance Effect of hammering 
S.No. Object/Material (lustrous/ Hard/Soft (flattens/breaks into 

non-lustrous) pieces)

1. Piece of copper 

2. Piece of aluminium

3. Iron nail

4. Piece of coal

5. Lump of sulfur 
(pea-sized)

6. Block of wood

Analyse Table 4.1. Identify the objects that are lustrous in 
appearance and hard. You might have observed that objects made 
from copper, aluminium, and iron are lustrous in appearance 
and are hard. Lustre shown by metals is known as metallic 
lustre. Materials like copper, aluminium, and iron are known as 
metals, whereas, coal, sulfur, and wood are non-lustrous and 
not as hard as metals. 

Are all metals hard and solid? Not really; some metals like 
sodium and potassium are so soft that they can be cut with a 
knife. There is one metal, mercury, that is found in a liquid state at 
room temperature, which you might have seen in thermometers. 
Recall the chapter ‘Temperature and its Measurement’ from the 
Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity. 

Which objects did you find become flat on beating with a 
hammer?

You must have observed that objects such as a piece of copper, 
an iron nail, and a piece of aluminium become flat when beaten; 
whereas other objects or materials behave differently. This 
property by which materials can be beaten into thin sheets is 
called malleability. Most metals possess this property. Can you 
give some examples of metal sheets? You might have seen thin 
silver foil on some sweets and aluminium foil used for wrapping 
food items. These are formed due to their malleability. Gold and 
silver are the most malleable metals. 

Chapter 4.indd   43 4/3/2025   4:52:08 PM

The World of Metals and Non-metals



A piece of coal or a lump of sulfur does not show this behaviour. 
They break into pieces and are said to be brittle. On the other 
hand, wood neither gets flattened into a sheet nor breaks into 
pieces. Therefore, wood is neither malleable nor brittle. 

HOLISTIC LENS
The impact of iron on the progress of civilisation of India
In the Grade 6 Social Science textbook Exploring Society India and 
Beyond, you learnt about the Harappans. They knew how to use 
metals like copper and gold. They used these metals to make various 
objects, from utensils to jewellery. However, you would hardly find 
any evidence of the Harappans using a very prominent metal iron, 
which you see a lot around you today. This is because it took a long 
time before iron was used in day-to-day activities.
 However, once the use of iron gained prominence in the times that 
followed, it contributed significantly to the progress of civilisation in 
India. For instance, due to its strength, agricultural tools like ploughs 
made from iron were much superior to those used previously. 
 What could be the potential reason that it is generally considered 
that copper was discovered earlier as compared to iron?

4.1.2 Ductility
Where do you find the use of metal wires? 

You might have seen wires of metals like copper or aluminium 
in electrical fittings. Some ornaments, like bangles, necklaces, 
earrings, etc., are also made from metal wires. Metal wires play 
important functions in a variety of stringed musical instruments, 
such as veena, sitar, violin, and guitar.

This property of materials by which they can be drawn into 
wires is called ductility.

This property of ductility is mainly possessed by metals.

Gold is so ductile The ductile nature of

Have you ever seen wires made of coal or sulfur? Obviously 

not! We can say that coal and sulfur are not ductile.

Do you know that ropes made of steel [a mixture 
of metal (iron) and non-metal (carbon)] wires can DIVE

4.1.3 Sonority
Have you ever noticed the sound produced when a metal spoon, 
or a metal plate, or a metal coin is dropped on the floor? How is it 
different from the sound produced when a piece of coal or wood 
is dropped on the floor?

You would observe that the metal spoon and the metal coin 
produce a ringing sound. Coal and wood, on the other hand, 
produce dull sounds. 

This property of metals that enables them to produce a ringing 
sound is called sonority, and metals are said to be sonorous in 
nature.

4.1.4 Conduction of heat
Have you ever observed the vessels used for cooking in the 
kitchen? You might have noticed that the vessels used for heating 
are made of metals. Can you name some metals that are used for 
making cooking vessels? Do you know why these metals are used 
for this purpose?
Let us find out!

Activity 4.3: Let us investigate

Caution— This activity must be performed under the supervision of 
your teacher or an adult. Be careful while handling hot water.

Metal  Place a glass tumbler on a table. 
spoon Wooden  Fill it with hot water. 

spoon  Take a metal spoon and a wooden 
spoon of almost the same size and 
thickness.

 Immerse both the spoons 
simultaneously into the hot water 
(Fig. 4.3) and leave them undisturbed 
for a few minutes.

Fig. 4.3: Metal and wooden spoons  Now, carefully touch the upper end 
immersed in hot water of each spoon.

46

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7



47
Some discussion points:
 Which of the spoons get hotter?
 What does this experiment tell us about heat transfer along 

the two spoons? 
You may have noticed that the metal spoon is hotter to touch 

than the wooden spoon. Even though both spoons are immersed 
in the water of the same temperature and for the same time. This 
shows that the heat transfers through the metal spoon, making it 
hotter. In contrast, the wooden spoon transfers heat poorly. 

In such cases, the transfer of heat from one point to another 
of a material is called conduction, and materials that transfer 
heat are called conductors.

Based on the observations, one can say that metals are good 
conductors of heat, whereas wood is a poor conductor of heat. 
Now, we can understand why mostly metal vessels are used 
for cooking, and their handles are made with wood or other 
materials that do not conduct heat. You will learn more about 
this in the chapter ‘Heat Transfer in Nature’. 

4.1.5 Conduction of electricity
Have you ever seen an electrician using a screwdriver? What 
type of material is used for making its handle? You may have 
also noticed the electrician wearing rubber gloves and shoes 
while working. What can be the reason for this?

Activity 4.4: Let us design and create

Design an electric circuit, like the ‘tester’ circuit in the chapter 
‘Electricity: Circuits and their Components’. Repeat the same 
activity using the materials listed below and record your 
observations in Table 4.2.
 You may collect a few objects, such as a piece of aluminium 

foil, an iron nail, a lump of sulfur (pea-sized), a copper wire, 
a piece of coal, a piece of dry wood, a stone, an eraser made 
of rubber and a piece of nylon rope.

 Predict which of these could make the bulb of the tester 
glow and which could not. 

Chapter 4.indd   47 4/3/2025   4:52:14 PM

The World of Metals and Non-metals

4. …

You might have observed that objects made of aluminium, 
iron, and copper make the bulb glow, whereas sulfur, coal, 
wood, stone, eraser, and nylon rope could not make it glow. Do 
you see any pattern in the glowing of bulbs when using different 
materials in Activity 4.4? It is observed that all the materials that 
make the bulb glow are metals.

Materials that allow electricity to flow through them easily 
are called good conductors of electricity. In contrast, materials 
that prevent the bulb from glowing by not allowing electricity to 
pass through them are called poor conductors of electricity. 

So, now we can understand that the plastic covering on 
screwdrivers and rubber gloves protect the electrician from 
electric shock because these materials are poor conductors of 
electricity.

We learnt that metals are generally hard, lustrous, malleable, 
ductile, and good conductors of heat and electricity. Now, let us 
learn how metals behave in the presence of air and water.

4.2 Effect of Air and Water on Metals: Iron
You would have often noticed that iron objects develop brown 
deposits when left in the open for a few days. In which conditions 
would an iron object develop brown deposits? 
 When it comes into contact with dry air only.
 When it comes into contact with water only.
 When it comes into contact with both air and water.

Activity 4.5: Let us experiment

Caution— Be careful while handling iron nails.
 Take a few shining iron nails. If you are using old iron 

nails, make sure to remove brown deposits from their 
surface by scrubbing them with the help of a small 
piece of sandpaper. A Thread

 Take three clean, dry glass bottles or test tubes with Iron nail
tight-fitting caps or stoppers. Label them A, B, and C. Silica gel

 Take three iron nails and tie each iron nail with a thread. Fig. 4.4(a)
 Place one iron nail and some silica gel in the glass bottle 

‘A’, and tighten the cap or stopper (Fig. 4.4a). Silica gel 
makes the air dry. It is the substance that is used in 
small pouches in some medicine bottles, water bottles, B Thread

shoe boxes, etc., to keep them dry. Oil

 Place one iron nail in the glass bottle ‘B’. Pour freshly Iron nail
boiled and cooled water (to remove dissolved gases) Water
into it until the iron nail is completely dipped in it. Now, Fig. 4.4(b)
pour some oil to form a layer over the surface of the 
water (Fig. 4.4b). The layer of oil on the surface of the 
water prevents the air from dissolving in the water. Cap 
the glass bottle tightly. C Thread

 Place one iron nail in the glass bottle ‘C’, and pour some 
water so that the iron nail is partially dipped. Keep this Iron nail
glass bottle unstoppered. This allows the iron nail to Water
come into contact with both water and air, as shown in Fig. 4.4(c)
Fig. 4.4c.

The World of Metals and Non-metals



What can you conclude from this experiment? 
It is observed in glass bottles A and B that the iron nails do not 

show any brown deposits. What does this observation indicate? 
This indicates that brown deposits or discolouration on the iron 
nails do not develop when the iron nail is kept in dry air alone 
(bottle A) or water alone (bottle B). However, in glass bottle C, the 
iron nail shows the presence of brown deposits. This indicates that 
the presence of both water and air is essential for these deposits 
to develop. Thus, moist air is responsible for the development of 
brown deposits on objects made of iron. This brown deposit is 
called rust. The process of formation of rust on objects made of 
iron is called rusting. 

Many other metals also exhibit discolouration when kept open 
in the atmosphere. Have you noticed the formation of a green 
coating on the surface of copper objects or a black coating on the 
surface of silver objects? Gradual deterioration of metal surfaces 
caused by air, water, or other substances is known as corrosion. 

Do you know that rusting of iron is a serious problem in our 
country? Every year, an enormous amount of money is spent to 
replace or repair iron structures damaged due to rusting. 

The rusting of iron can be prevented by several methods such 
as painting, oiling, greasing, and applying a protective layer of 
zinc metal on iron (galvanisation). We will learn about this in 
higher grades.

FASCINATING FACTS
The wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy!     
The Iron Pillar of Delhi was made in the time of 
Chandragupta II more than 1600 years ago. It is about 
8 metres high and weighs more than 6000 kilograms. 
What is interesting about this iron pillar is that despite 
all these years of facing winds, rainfall, and intense 
weather, it has barely any rust. 

In other words, it has been made in 
a way that it resists rusting. This tells us 
about the skills that were developed in 
metal technology in India.

 Let the magnesium ribbon burn.
 What do you observe?
 You must have observed that Fig. 4.5: Burning magnesium ribbon

magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling white flame and 
changes into a white powder. Collect it on a watch glass. This 
powder is magnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction 
between magnesium and oxygen present in the air. 

 Add a few drops of warm water to this white powder, stir it 
well, and check its nature. 

 Recall the chapter ‘Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and 
Neutral’. Find out whether the solution of magnesium oxide 
is acidic or basic or neutral in nature. You can use any 
acid-base indicator.

Do you know that sodium is a metal which is stored in kerosene 
because it reacts vigorously with oxygen and water. A lot of heat 
is generated in the reaction. Storing sodium in kerosene prevents 
its exposure to moisture and air. Can you predict the nature of 
its oxide?

Let us now discuss some substances that do not behave like 
metals.

4.4 Substances that Behave Differently 
from Metals in Air and Water

Activity 4.7: Let us experiment (demonstration activity)

Caution— This activity must be performed in a fume hood 
or well-ventilated area. Burning sulfur produces gases, which 
can be harmful if inhaled. 

Fig. 4.7(a): Deflagrating 
spoon  Take a small amount of powdered sulfur in a 

deflagrating spoon (it is a long-handled metal 
spoon used in experiments to safely heat and burn 
substances Fig. 4.7a). If a deflagrating spoon is not 
available, you may take a metallic cap of any bottle, 
wrap a metallic wire around it and give it the shape 
as shown in Fig. 4.7b.

 Heat it on a flame, and as soon as the sulfur starts 
burning, introduce the deflagrating spoon into a 

Fig. 4.7(b): Improvised gas jar or glass tumbler (Fig. 4.7c). Cover the gas jar 
deflagrating spoon or glass tumbler with a lid to ensure that the gas 

produced does not escape.
 Remove the lid after 3 – 4 minutes and take out the 

deflagrating spoon. Add a small quantity of water 
into the gas jar, quickly place the lid back and shake 
it so that the gas dissolves. 

 Again, recall the chapter ‘Exploring Substances: 
Acidic, Basic, and Neutral’. Using an acid-base 

Gas jar indicator, check whether the solution obtained 
after the addition of water to the gas jar is acidic or 

Sulfur basic or neutral.

 Take some sulfur powder in a glass tumbler. 
 Add a small amount of water to it.
 What do you observe?

You may have noticed that there is no reaction when sulfur is 
placed in water. 

Substances like sulfur and phosphorus behave differently 
with air and water than metals. Phosphorus is stored in water 
as it catches fire when exposed to atmospheric air. These 
substances are usually soft and dull in appearance. They are 
neither malleable nor ductile, and they are not sonorous. They 
are also poor conductors of heat and electricity. These are called 
non-metals. Their oxides are acidic in nature. 

Some other non-metals are oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, 
etc. These must not be confused with materials such as plastic, 
glass, wood, rubber, and paper. These materials are not classified 
as metals or non-metals because they are not elements. 

Metals and non-metals are sub-categories of 
substances called elements. An element is a substance DIVE

EEPER
that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. 

Presently 118 elements are known. These 
elements are the basic building blocks of all matter. 
Some are naturally occurring, while others are 
artificially made in the laboratory, and do not exist 
in nature. You will study more about elements in 
higher grades.

4.5 Are Non-metals Essential in 
Everyday Life?

You often observe many metals in your day-to-day lives because 
of their distinct properties, such as their lustrous nature, heat

and electrical conductivity, and high strength. However, this 
should not give an impression in your mind that non-metals are 
not important in our lives. 

We breathe in oxygen, which is a non-metal, and without it, 
we would not be able to survive. Can you think of any other uses 
of oxygen?

Carbon is essential in everyday life because it is the building 
block of all life forms. It is a key component of proteins, fats, and 
carbohydrates, which are necessary for growth and energy. 

Nitrogen is used in the manufacturing of fertilisers and other 
chemicals. It is an essential nutrient for the growth of plants. 
Chlorine is a non-metal commonly used in water purification. 
A solution of iodine, a non-metal, is applied on wounds as an 
antiseptic. 

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Do you know that many metals and their alloys (mixtures of two or 
more metals or a metal and a non-metal) are important for daily use as 
utensils and tools. These are also important for modern technologies 
and essential in almost every industry. Some special metals are also 
used in atomic energy (such as zirconium), aerospace (titanium), etc. 
In India, many metals, especially iron and aluminium, are recycled to 
minimise waste and contribute to sustainability. 

In a Nutshell

 Metals and non-metals are differentiated based on their 
properties.

 Generally, metals are lustrous, whereas most non-metals are 
non-lustrous.

 Metals are generally malleable and ductile, while non-metals 
do not have these properties.

 Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity, but 
non-metals are generally poor conductors.

 Metals react with oxygen to produce metal oxides which are 
basic in nature.

 Non-metals react with oxygen to produce oxides which are 
acidic in nature.

 Generally, non-metals do not react with water.
 Metal objects get damaged when exposed to moist air, and 

the process is known as corrosion.
 Metals and non-metals have wide applications in 

everyday life.

Changes Around Us: 
5 Physical and Chemical

I placed a cube of ice 
here half an hour ago. 
It has now become 
water!

A bud that I saw 
yesterday on this rose 
plant has become a 
flower today.

The bottle containing 
cold water is not cold 
anymore.

Yesterday, I saw some 
brown spots on a 
banana, but today it 
has more brown spots 
and a strong smell.

These students are describing some changes. What kinds of 
changes are they talking about?

Chapter 5.indd   57 4/3/2025   4:52:45 PM



Activity 5.1: Let us think and reflect

You might have observed various changes happening around 
you. Some of them are listed in Table 5.1, you may notice that 
something is changing in each case. Take a moment to reflect on 
the changes in each case. Record your observations in Table 5.1.

Table 5.1: Some changes observed around us

S.No. Change Observation(s)

1. Melting ice cubes

2. Chopping vegetables 

3. Boiling water

4. Making popcorn from corn

5. Cutting a piece of paper

6. Adding beetroot extract to water

7. Burning wood  

8. Drying wet clothes 

9. Making small balls of dough 

10. Rolling small balls of dough into chapatis

11. Any other

You might have noticed that these changes could be in the size, 
shape, smell, or other property of the substance or object. Can you 
think of some other changes that happen in your surroundings? 
Make a list of those changes too.  

We observe the changes occurring around us with the help of 
our senses of sight, smell, touch, hearing, and taste.

Can we arrange these 
changes into categories?

Let us try to answer this question.

5.1 A Substance May Change in 
Appearance but Remain the Same!

Activity 5.2: Let us create and discuss

A. Creating some objects with paper 
 Take a few sheets of paper 

and fold them to create 
new objects (Fig. 5.1).

 Do you get the same paper 
back when you unfold 
these objects?

B. Playing with a balloon
 Take a balloon and inflate 

it. Now, loosen your grip 
and let the air escape out. Fig. 5.1: Objects made from paper

 Do you get the uninflated balloon back? 
 Take another balloon; inflate it and grip the opening 

tightly. Now, prick it with a pin. 
Caution — Be careful while using a pin.
 What happens? Will you be able to get the uninflated 

balloon back?
C. Crushing a piece of chalk
 Crush a small piece of chalk into powder.
 Can you get the chalk piece back from the powder?

Is there any similarity in the changes listed in A, B, and C?
During all these changes, materials, such as the paper, the 

rubber sheet of the balloon, and the chalk, remained the same, 
though their appearances (shape or size) may have changed. You 
may also recall from the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity that 
water can exist in different states (solid, liquid, and gas), and can 
change from one state to another. 

In all these cases, although we observe a change in the 
appearance, no new substance is formed. Such changes in which 
only physical properties like shape, size, and state of substances 
change are called physical changes. 
Let us explore a different type of change.

5.2 A Substance May Change in 
Appearance and Not Remain 
the Same!

Activity 5.3: Let us explore 

 Take two glass tumblers or small transparent bottles. Mark 
them A and B. 

 Fill one-fourth of glass tumbler A with tap water and 
one-fourth of glass tumbler B with lime water. 

 Now, blow air (exhale) into each glass tumbler, one at a time, 
using separate straws (Fig. 5.2) and observe them. 

Caution — Do not suck the water or lime water while doing this.

(a) (b)

Straw Straw

A Glass tumbler  B Glass tumbler 
containing tap containing 
water lime water

Fig. 5.2: Blowing air in (a) tap water; (b) lime water
Do you notice any changes?  
In glass tumbler A, blowing air into water creates bubbles 

only, and there is no change in the appearance of the water. In 
glass tumbler B, blowing air into lime water creates bubbles, and 
turns the lime water milky (or cloudy). If we leave it for some 
time, a white substance settles at the bottom of the glass tumbler, 
indicating something new has formed. Such changes, in which 
one or more new substances are formed, are called chemical 
changes. New substances are formed through a process called 
chemical reaction. In this case, carbon dioxide from the air you 
breathe out (exhale) reacts with lime water, and forms a new 
white-coloured substance (calcium carbonate) that is insoluble 
in water. Therefore, the liquid in the bottle appears milky. Along 
with this a small amount of water is also formed. This formation 
of a new substance indicates a chemical change. The chemical 
reaction involved in this change can be represented in short 
form as a chemical equation.

Calcium hydroxide + Carbon dioxide  Calcium carbonate + Water

       (Lime water) (Insoluble substance)
The turning of lime water milky is also used as a test for 

carbon dioxide. Let us explore this with another activity using 
some substances from our kitchen.

Activity 5.4: Let us experiment 
 Take a teaspoonful of vinegar or lemon juice in a test tube.
 Add a pinch of baking soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate) 

to it.
 What do you observe?
 You would hear a fizzing bubbling sound and see the gas 

bubbles forming.
 Pass this gas through freshly prepared lime water kept in 

another test tube, as shown in Fig. 5.3a. 
 What do you observe?
 The lime water turns milky. What do you infer about the gas 

formed by mixing vinegar and baking soda?
This indicates that the gas formed is carbon dioxide.

This activity can also be performed using two small used 
bottles instead of test tubes and a flexible straw, as shown in 
Fig. 5.3b.

Fig. 5.3: Reaction of vinegar and baking soda
Since a new substance, carbon dioxide, is formed in this 

reaction, we say that a chemical change has occurred here as 
well. It can be represented as—

Vinegar + Baking soda  Carbon dioxide + Other substances
Repeat the above activity using baking soda and water. Do you 

observe any bubble formation? Is this a physical or a chemical 
change?

5.3 Some Other Processes Involving 
Chemical Changes

5.3.1 Rusting
In the rusting of iron, which you studied 
in the chapter ‘The World of Metals and 
Non-metals’, a new brown-coloured 
substance called rust is formed. Thus, 
rusting is also a chemical change because 
it involves the formation of a new 
substance, iron oxide (Fig. 5.4). Fig. 5.4: Rusted 

iron nails
5.3.2 Combustion
Let us recall the burning of a magnesium ribbon 
(Fig. 5.5) learnt in the chapter ‘The World of 
Metals and Non-metals’. Can you predict if this is 
a physical or a chemical change?

When the magnesium ribbon is burnt, a new 
substance, magnesium oxide, is formed. So, the 
burning of magnesium ribbon also involves a 
chemical change. We observed that heat and light 

Fig. 5.5: Burning magnesium ribbon are also produced along with the formation of a 
new substance in this reaction.

The burning of magnesium ribbon can be represented as—
Magnesium + Oxygen  Magnesium oxide + Heat + Light

    (Ribbon)          (Air)         (White powder)
A chemical reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen 

and produces heat and/or light is called combustion. Substances 
that undergo combustion reactions are called combustible
substances. For example, wood, paper, cotton, kerosene, etc., 
are combustible substances.

Let us find out whether the presence of oxygen 
is essential for combustion. 

Activity 5.5: Let us investigate 
 Place two identical candles on two separate 

petri dishes and light them.
 Cover one of these with a glass tumbler, as 

(a) (b) shown in Fig. 5.6. 
Fig. 5.6: Candle (a) burning  What happens to the candle flames in the two 

(b) covered with a glass tumbler cases?     
62

Chapter 5.indd   62 4/3/2025   4:52:49 PM

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7



63
We observe that the candle that was not covered (Fig. 5.6a) 

continues to burn, whereas the candle that was covered with a 
glass tumbler (Fig. 5.6b) stops burning after some time. Why does 
this happen?

Since the candle covered by the glass tumbler does not have 
a continuous supply of air, the flame gets extinguished soon. 
The component of air that supports combustion is oxygen. This 
can be confirmed by the presence of carbon dioxide in the glass 
tumbler inverted on the candle. How can you test the presence 
of carbon dioxide gas? 

You can test the carbon dioxide gas by adding a small amount 
of lime water in the petri dish. You will notice that it turns milky. 
This carbon dioxide was formed by the carbon from the wax and 
the oxygen from the air. In other words, oxygen is required for 
combustion.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
If a person’s clothes catch fire, what is the best way to extinguish 
the fire?

Wrap a blanket or cloth around the person. This cuts off the 
supply of air, and the fire gets extinguished. 
Caution — Synthetic blanket or cloth should never be used to put 
out a fire, as these can melt and stick to the skin.

FASCINATING FACTS
Nature’s wonders: You might have 
seen some insects emitting light in 
a garden or a field in late evenings. 
These insects are called fireflies, and 
their light is produced by a chemical 
change. This type of light production 
(without heat) in living organisms is 
called bioluminescence.

Fireflies 

Is the Presence of Air Enough for Combustion?
We learnt above that combustible substances and oxygen 
are necessary for combustion. We also know that paper is a 
combustible substance, but we can keep it in the air for any 
length of time without it catching fire. What else is needed to 
start combustion?
Let us learn about this.

Chapter 5.indd   63 4/3/2025   4:52:50 PM

 Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical



Activity 5.6: Let us investigate 
Caution — Perform this activity under the supervision of your teacher 
or an adult.

 Hold a piece of paper with a pair of 
tongs and bring a lighted matchstick 
to it. It quickly catches fire. Do we say 
that we need a fire to start the burning 
process? 

 Take another piece of paper. Using a 
magnifying glass, focus the sunrays to 
make the smallest and brightest spot on 
the paper, as shown in the Fig. 5.7a. 
Hold it there for some time. 

What do you observe?
Fig. 5.7(a): Focusing the sunrays using a 

magnifying glass We observe that the paper starts to 
emit smoke, and then catches fire 
(Fig. 5.7b). Thus, we find that a substance 
can burn even without fire. How do we 
explain this change?

Focusing sunrays on the paper heats 
it. The temperature of the paper increases 
with time. After some time, the paper 
becomes so hot that it starts burning. 
This minimum temperature at which a 
substance catches fire is called its ignition 
temperature. Since the temperature of the 
lighted matchstick was already higher than 

Fig. 5.7(b): Paper catching fire the ignition temperature of the paper, it 
caught fire almost immediately.

So, we can conclude that for the combustion process to occur, 
there are three requirements (Fig. 5.8) —

(i) A combustible substance, also called ‘fuel’
(ii) Oxygen

(iii) Heat that allows the fuel to reach its ignition temperature.

Occur in the Same Process?

Activity 5.7: Think, pair, and share

Look at the Fig. 5.9. Analyse what students are discussing about 
the burning candle. 
What do you think?

The wax melts and 
evaporates... Wax melts, flows, 

and solidifies in 
different shapes...

I think the wax burns, 
and new substances 
are formed… 

Maybe...

Maybe the wick 
draws up the liquid 
wax…

Fig. 5.9: What changes occur when a candle burns?
The wax of the candle melts, is carried up the wick, and 

evaporates due to the heat of the flame. The vapour of wax burns 
to produce a flame. The melting of wax, its solidification, and 
evaporation are physical changes. The burning of vapour on the 
other hand, is a chemical change. This shows that the burning of 
a candle involves both physical and chemical changes.

KNOW A SCIENTIST
The candle you just observed has long been an object of curiosity for 
several scientists including Michael Faraday, who made significant 

contributions to several areas of science. In the 
nineteenth century, Faraday delivered a series 
of lectures called Chemical History of a Candle. 
Faraday believed that the candle was the perfect 
object to introduce scientific study. Through 
it, he discussed differences between various 
physical and chemical processes like melting, 
vapourisation, and combustion.

Chapter 5.indd   65 4/3/2025   4:52:53 PM

 Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical



5.5 Are Changes Permanent?
Once something has undergone a change, can we get it back in 
its original form?

Activity 5.8: Let us think

Think again about all the changes that we have discussed 
or talked about so far. In which of these can we get back the 
object or substance in the form we started with? Record your 
observations in Table 5.2.

Table 5.2: Can changes be reversed?

S.No. Change The original state can be 
brought back (Yes/No)

1. Melting ice cubes Yes
2. Chopping vegetables No
3. Boiling water Yes
4. Making popcorn from corn No
5.

...

12.
Returning to the original object or substance with which we 

started shows that the changes we brought can be reversed. For 
example, when ice melts, it can be refrozen into ice. Similarly, 
when water evaporates, it can be condensed back into liquid 
water. However, some changes cannot be reversed since we 
cannot get the original object or substance back after the change. 
For example, chopped vegetables cannot return to their original 
size and shape, and making popcorn cannot go back to its original 
form. Thus, changes around us could be grouped into those that 
can be reversed and those that cannot be reversed.

5.6 Are All Changes Desirable? 
Many useful changes happen in our daily life. For example, the 
changing of milk into curd, ripening of fruits, cutting of fruits, 
and cooking of food. All these are desirable changes. Can you 
think of some other desirable changes happening around you?

66

Chapter 5.indd   66 4/3/2025   4:52:53 PM

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7



67
On the other hand, some changes may be undesirable, such 

as the rusting of iron or the decay of food during its storage. 
A change that is undesirable in some situations may be desirable 
in other situations. For example, decomposition of food can be 
very useful in converting food waste into compost.

Some changes occurring over the years due to human activity 
can have a long-term environmental impact. For example, the 
increased consumption of fuels in cars, trains, aeroplanes, etc., 
is increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
Drying of paint on walls, doors, furniture, etc., releases many 
substances through evaporation, causing atmospheric pollution.

5.7 Some Slow Natural Changes

5.7.1 Weathering of rocks
Have you seen heaps of sand, soil, and stones lying at the base of 
mountains as shown in Fig. 5.10a? These are called sediments. How 
have these formed? These are formed by physical changes that 
break up large rocks into smaller pieces. Temperature changes due 
to climatic conditions, growing roots of trees, and even freezing of 
water within cracks in the rocks can cause them to break.

Water or chemicals present in water, can also react with 
the rocks and cause chemical changes in their composition. An 
example of such a chemical change is shown in Fig. 5.10b. Here, 
an originally black-coloured rock called basalt, which contains 
iron, has chemically changed to produce a red-coloured layer. The 
red colour is a result of the iron oxide produced when the rock 
surface was exposed for a long time to water or air containing 
water vapour. These physical and chemical changes in rocks are 
collectively called weathering, which eventually leads to the 
formation of soil.

Chapter 5.indd   67 4/3/2025   4:52:54 PM

 Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical



5.7.2 Erosion 
Have you noticed fine sand collecting on riverbeds or in lakes? 
This sand is formed when rock pebbles, soil, and sediments are 
broken down and moved from one location to another by natural 
forces like wind and flowing water. This process is called erosion.

Erosion during a landslide is an example of a physical change. 
River rocks and pebbles often appear smoother due to the 
constant erosion caused by the flowing water. When the speed 
of the water or wind decreases, such as in an ocean or a lake, the 
material transported during erosion settles down at the bottom. 
These sediments harden over time and become new rocks. Most 
of these changes take place over thousands of years and cannot 
be reversed.

In a Nutshell

 A physical change is one in which a substance or object 
undergoes a change in its physical properties and no new 
substance is formed.

 A chemical change is one in which one or more new 
substances are formed. It involves a chemical reaction and 
can be represented by a chemical equation.

 Combustion, cooking, and rusting are examples of chemical 
changes.

 Substances that undergo combustion are combustible 
substances. Heat and/or light are given out during 
combustion.

 The lowest temperature at which a substance can catch fire 
is called its ignition temperature. 

 Some changes can be reversed and some cannot.
 Some changes are desirable and some are not.
 Rocks undergo physical and chemical changes due to 

weathering to form soil.
 Erosion caused by flowing water and wind is a physical 

change.

Adolescence:  
6 A Stage of Growth 

and Change
The journey of a plant generally begins with the germination of a 
seed. With proper nourishment, the seed becomes a sapling and 
matures into a young plant. This journey is marked by some specific 
changes. Some of the visible changes are an increase in its height, the 
appearance of more leaves, and the development of flowers, fruits, 
and new seeds. From these seeds, new plants emerge.

It is quite unlikely that a seedling will develop the capabilities 
to produce its own seeds immediately after germination. It needs 
to grow and reach maturity to become capable of producing 
seeds. Similarly, animals also need to grow and reach maturity 
before they can reproduce. Some animals lay eggs that hatch 
into young ones, while others, like humans, directly give birth to 
young ones. In both cases, the young ones gradually grow in size 
and develop over time.

Chapter 6.indd   73 04-04-2025   04:25:25



The journey of life of a human can be divided into different 
stages—infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. 
Each person experiences these stages at their own pace, and the 
duration of each stage may vary from one individual to another. 
From infancy to adulthood, our bodies undergo various changes. 
Until around 10–12 years of age, most changes are related to 
height and weight. After this, other noticeable changes begin to 
occur, marking the onset of adolescence. This is a period of rapid 
growth and development, typically occurring between the ages 
of 10–19. During adolescence, the body prepares for adulthood.

Humans, like most other living beings, can not reproduce 
immediately after their birth. Their bodies need to grow and 
reach a stage of maturity to be able to reproduce.

As humans grow and develop, they experience significant 
physical, emotional, and behavioural changes, along with the 
ability to reproduce. Some of these changes may be quite clearly 
observable, while others occur internally and may go unnoticed. 
In this chapter, you will explore adolescence, understand its 
importance, and learn how to handle it with a sense of responsibility.

During the summer vacation, Venkatesh visited his grandparents. 
As he entered the house, his 12-year-old cousin, Devyani came

between Venkatesh and Devyani.

Activity 6.1: Let us discuss
	 Take a jar and some paper slips.
	 Write down the changes you can notice among students as 

they go from Grades 5 to 8. These could be related to height, 
strength, behaviour, or any other aspect. Please avoid writing 

74 names on the slips.

	 Fold the slips and place them in the jar.
	 Mix all the slips received from the students in the class and 

unfold the collected slips one by one. Based on the information 
on the slips, discuss the changes with the students in the class.

What were the most commonly observable changes among 
students, as mentioned on the slips? List these in Table 6.1.

Have you also experienced some of these changes? If yes, then 
it is because you are also reaching this stage gradually. This stage 
starts around 10 years of age and can continue up to the age of 
19. It is usually a stage of development between childhood and 
adulthood, and is called adolescence.

While analysing Table 6.1, you might have noticed the following:

Increase in height
From birth, our body undergoes continuous growth 
and development including an increase in height. 
However, the increase in height becomes more 
prominent during adolescence.

Changes in body structure, weight gain, and 
strength
As boys grow, it might be seen that along with growing 
taller, they gain weight, their shoulders might become 
a bit broader, and their chests may get wider.
	 Girls also undergo changes in height and weight, 
and other body changes like development of breasts. 

Chapter 6.indd   75 04-04-2025   04:25:30

Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change



Changes in voice
In adolescent boys, the growth of the voice box leads 
to a voice that sounds hoarse. The voice box is a 
structure in our throat that helps us to speak. The 
growth may be seen as a bump in the throat region 
and is called the Adam’s apple. However, it is not 

Adam's noticeable in every individual. The voice box also 
apple grows in adolescent girls but it is not as big as in the 

boys, leading to only slight changes in voice. 

Appearance of hair in different parts of body
Both boys and girls experience the growth of hair in 
different parts of their bodies, such as the armpits and 
pubic region. 
	 Boys often develop facial hair, which later grows 
into a moustache and a beard as they move towards 
adulthood. Some boys may also develop chest hair and 
back hair, though few boys may have no significant 
hair growth. Variations in and timing of appearance of 
hair growth is completely normal.

Changes in facial skin: emergence of pimples
Another common occurrence during the adolescent 
years is a skin condition called acne, in which small, 
reddish pimples appear. These are commonly visible 
on the face. Acne occurs due to an increase in oily 
secretions from the skin during adolescence that can 
clog the skin pores and lead to infections. While acne 
is a condition, pimples are a manifestation of it.

A key point to remember
Whether it is a change in height, voice, or facial hair, it is 
important to recognise that the timing, nature, and extent 
of these changes vary among individuals. These variations 
are completely normal.
	 Each person experiences adolescence at his or her 
own pace, and its duration also varies from one person to 
another.

77
Now, we have understood some of the changes that take place 

during adolescence, particularly those that are easily observable. 
Some of these characteristic changes, like change in voice, the growth 
of facial and chest hair in boys, and the development of breasts 
in girls  are not directly involved in the process of reproduction. 
However, these characteristic changes help distinguish males 
from females. For this reason, they are called secondary sexual 
characteristics.

Secondary sexual characteristics are natural signs that the 
body is preparing for adulthood. They mark the onset of puberty. 
Puberty is the stage in which the body of an adolescent undergoes 
external and internal changes to develop into an adult capable of 
reproduction. 

6.2	 Changes that Indicate Reproductive 
Capability

Adolescence is marked not only by observable changes but also 
by internal changes that are not visible from the outside. One such 
change is the maturation of various parts involved in the process 
of reproduction.

Both boys and girls experience such changes gradually, and 
these changes are a natural part of the process of growing up. 
An important internal change associated with adolescent girls is 
the onset of the menstrual cycle. It recurs generally every 28–30 
days and is more commonly known as ‘the period’. Many healthy 
girls may have longer or shorter menstrual cycles ranging from 
21–35 days. The menstrual cycle is an important natural process 
and is one of the signs of good reproductive health. The phase of 
the cycle when blood discharge occurs from the body is referred 
to as menstruation. It may last for three to seven days. Some girls 
may feel pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen during these 
days. Usually, by the age of 45–55, menstruation stops naturally, 
marking the end of the reproductive capability in a woman’s life.

Breaking myths about menstruation
There are many wrong beliefs about menstruation that 
often lead to unnecessary fear, shame, or even guilt. These 
beliefs have given rise to certain myths and taboos. Among 
such myths and taboos, physical isolation of menstruating 
girls is unfortunately still quite prevalent. Menstruation is a 
natural process, and such myths have no scientific basis. By 
encouraging a scientific outlook towards menstruation, we can 
help society appreciate the need to promote good reproductive 
health of women and contribute positively towards a healthier 
lifestyle for women.

Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change



Adolescence is not just about physical changes or changes 
associated with reproductive capability but also about emotional 
and behavioural changes. Let us discuss them!

6.3	 Emotional and Behavioural Changes 
in Adolescents

Activity 6.2: Let us list

Take a moment to think if there are any changes in your emotions 
or behaviour or that of your classmates and friends in the past 
one or two years. These changes may be exciting, confusing, or 
both.

Let us list some emotional changes in Table 6.2 along with 
their probable effects on behaviour and ways for positive growth 
and development.

ways for positive growth  and development

Mood swings Self-exploration and involvement

Any other

While discussing Table 6.2, you may have explored the 
diverse behavioural changes in adolescents. This is because 
adolescence is often marked by stronger emotions than 
childhood. These emotions might affect adolescents’ behaviour 
like taking up/joining social initiatives to support the needy and 
the disadvantaged, or developing deeper interest in new areas.

Understanding how our emotions influence our behaviour 
and actions, can help us make better choices and respond to 
situations thoughtfully.

6.4	 Making Adolescence a Joyful 
Experience

The journey of adolescence is a unique experience. Heightened 
curiosity and excitement during this stage of life give adolescents 
a new viewpoint towards almost everything around them. 
Good habits, thoughtful decisions, and small actions can have a 
powerful positive impact on the overall well-being of adolescents. 
Let us know about them!

6.4.1 Meeting nutritional needs
In Grade 6 chapter ‘Mindful Eating: A Path to a Healthy Body’, 
you learnt about the need for a healthy diet. Since adolescence is 
a period of growth and development marked by several changes 
in the body, a nutritious diet is of utmost importance.

For proper growth, and to perform 
well on the playground, we need 
proteins and carbohydrates!

Not only that, we also need 
an adequate amount of fats, 
vitamins, and minerals as well!

Activity 6.3: Let us list

Based on the locally available foods, fill Table 6.3 with the healthy 
food sources, nutrients present in them and how these nutrients 
can help our growth and development.

blood-related health problem(s) because of a deficiency of 
iron or vitamin B12 in the body.

	 How can we manage iron deficiency in our body?
	 Find out about government schemes aimed to prevent 

such deficiencies.

Dorothy Hodgkin was a brilliant scientist who studied the 
structure of vitamin B12. In 1964, she became the third 

woman to win the Nobel Prize in the 
field of chemistry. Did you know that 
vitamin B12 is required for the proper 
functioning of the human body? Like 
most vitamins, it cannot be made in the 
human body and has to be obtained 
from the food we eat. Discuss the sources 
of vitamin B12 with your teacher.

6.4.2 Personal hygiene
Besides nutrition, personal hygiene is also crucially important during 
adolescence. Maintaining body hygiene, particularly in the armpits 
and the pubic region, may protect us from potential infections.

For girls, maintaining proper hygiene during menstruation 
is essential for both comfort and health. Menstrual hygiene can 
be maintained using items such as sanitary pads (Fig. 6.1) and 
reusable cloth pads designed for this purpose.

The government also attempts to provide these products free 
of charge or at a low price to improve the menstrual hygiene of 

Fig. 6.1: Sanitary pad girls and women. As a society, we should all make efforts to ensure 
the availability of necessary facilities in schools and public places 
to promote menstrual hygiene. Collectively, we should move 
forward, reducing any stigma around sanitary pads and helping 
in menstrual hygiene.

It is important to dispose of used sanitary pads properly  by 
wrapping them in newspaper and disposing inside a dustbin. This 
is to ensure community health and environmental cleanliness. 
These days, biodegradable sanitary pads are also available that 

80 are environment-friendly.

Science and Society
To support menstrual hygiene, the government has introduced 
several initiatives—
	 Menstrual Hygiene Scheme (MHS): Under this scheme by the 

Government of India, sanitary pads are provided free of charge 
or at a reduced price to adolescent girls in rural areas. Awareness 
programmes are also conducted to educate girls about menstrual 
hygiene and health.

	 Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK): It aims to 
improve the overall health of adolescents, including menstrual 
health and hygiene. It encourages peer education, where older 
students help younger ones learn about these topics.

	 Suvidha Sanitary Napkin Initiative: Under this initiative, 
biodegradable sanitary pads are provided at affordable prices 
through Jan Aushadhi Kendras. The initiative aims to improve access 
to menstrual hygiene products for women and adolescent girls.

	 State-Level Initiatives: Various state governments have their 
own programmes, such as the ‘Shuchi Scheme’ in Karnataka 
and free sanitary napkin schemes in states like Tamil Nadu and 
Odisha. These programmes aim to distribute free sanitary pads in 
government schools.

6.4.3 Physical activities
Regular exercise and physical activities are also very important 
during adolescence. Do you exercise regularly or participate in 
games and sports? What kinds of exercises do you do? These 
activities will keep your body and mind fit and healthy, build up 
your stamina and boost your mood (Fig. 6.2).

6.4.4 Balanced social life
We all live in a society and interact with each other in our day-to-day 
life. We should all be polite and respectful towards each other 
(Fig. 6.3). This helps create a favourable and safe environment.

Since adolescence is a stage of life marked by new experiences 
and emotions, we must be thoughtful and responsible while 
interacting with others — whether in person or through social 
media. This is the time adolescents may feel attracted to their 
peers, and mimic their behaviour. Today, they often interact 
with each other online.

Fig. 6.3: Collaborative learning in action

Making fun Modern technologies have made online platforms 
available for all to obtain information, make 
connections, interact, and share information with 
each other. We should use these platforms responsibly 
for the collective well-being of all. Sometimes, we, 
knowingly or unknowingly, use social media platforms 
carelessly. Seeking guidance from elders and teachers 
can help use these platforms positively.

Fig. 6.4: Cyberbullying 

Science and Society
Cyberbullying involves the use of digital devices such as phones, 
computers, or online platforms to harass others by sending misleading 
messages, spreading false rumours, or sharing personal information 
without consent (Fig. 6.4). However, if someone tries to bully you, it is 
important not to feel scared or helpless. Rather, handle it wisely and 
seek help from parents and teachers. 
	 Additionally, you should be cautious when uploading any picture 
online or sharing  personal information with strangers.

6.4.5  Avoiding harmful substances — learn to 
say NO

Some people, including your peers, may tempt, persuade, force or, 
create pressure on you to consume harmful substances such as 
tobacco, gutka, cigarettes, beedi, alcohol, or even life-threatening 
illegal drugs. Since adolescence is marked by curiosity and 
excitement, adolescents might get influenced by such people and try 
these substances.

These substances are not just harmful to physical and mental 
health but are also addictive. This means that once people start 
consuming them, they develop a strong urge to take them again Someone who 
and again. Over time, they start using them regularly. This is called is addicted 
substance abuse. today, might

Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change



Using these substances can cause serious health problems, 
such as breathing difficulties, memory loss, and damage to the 
lungs (Fig. 6.5), depending on the substance. To stay healthy, it is 
important to completely avoid these substances and make healthy 
choices instead. It is important to remain firm and confident in 
your decision to say ‘NO’. 

The first step to overcoming addiction is seeking help and 
support from family and friends, and talking to trusted people, 
such as parents or teachers. Counselling and medical advice can 
also be helpful in handling such situations. Remember, your 
health and your future are in your hands — choose wisely!

Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan
The Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan was launched by the Ministry 
of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India. It 
intends to reach out to the masses and spread awareness on the 
issue of avoiding substance abuse through active participation of 
the youth, women, and the community. The special focus is on the 
prevention of substance abuse among early-age children. 

The Government has launched a National De-addiction Helpline— 
14446, to deal with drug addiction and to help drug addicts.

6.5 The ‘Why’ Question for Adolescence

We now understand the different 
changes in adolescence and also know 
some ways to handle it with a sense of 
responsibility.

But I wonder why these 
changes occur at this stage 
of life!

Many changes in adolescence, including menstruation and 
other signs of puberty, are mainly due to hormones — certain 
chemicals produced in our bodies. Hormones play a crucial 
role in regulating various aspects of growth and development, 
contributing to the proper functioning of the body. They are 
produced in different parts of the body and are released at an 
appropriate time in response to signals from the brain. Some 

84 hormones influence mood and behaviour.

By staying informed, seeking support and guidance when 

needed, and making healthy decisions, you can build a strong 
foundation for your life ahead.

In a Nutshell

	 Adolescence is the period of change from childhood to 
adulthood. It generally begins around the age of 10 years 
and usually lasts until 19 years.

	 Adolescence is marked by significant and characteristic 
physical, biological, and emotional changes.

	 Features that help to distinguish the male from the female 
but are not directly involved in reproduction are called 
secondary sexual characteristics.

	 Puberty is the stage in which the body of a child undergoes 
observable and internal changes to develop into an adult 
capable of reproduction.

	 Adolescence in girls is also marked by start of the menstrual 
cycle, during which there is a discharge of blood generally 
after every 28–30 days, a process called menstruation. 
Menstruation begins at puberty and generally ends by the 
age of 45–55 years. 

	 Adolescents face several emotional and behavioural changes. 
	 Eating a balanced and healthy diet, maintaining good 

personal hygiene, and participating in physical activities 
help adolescents to stay healthy. 

	 Addictive substances, such as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, 
have adverse effects on the body and mind. It is wise to say 
‘NO’ to these substances and stay away from them. 

	 Changes that take place in the body during adolescence are 
primarily controlled by certain chemicals produced in the 
body. These chemicals are called hormones.

	 Proper guidance and awareness help adolescents manage 
physical, emotional, and behavioural changes effectively.

7 Heat Transfer 
in Nature 

Pema and her brother Palden reside in Gangtok. On a cold winter 
evening, they are sitting around a fireplace. Palden shares his 
experiences of visiting Kerala during the winter vacation. He 
says that compared to Gangtok, winter in Kerala is comparatively 
warm and humid. Both Pema and Palden are curious about why 
some places are so cold and others quite hot. 

Hearing them express their curiosity, their grandfather, a 
retired science teacher, says, “Kerala is closer to the equator than 
Sikkim and it also has a long coastline, which results in warmer 
and more humid weather conditions”. Palden replies, “Yes, we 
learnt in Grade 6 Science and Social Science that for us on the 
Earth, the Sun is the main source of heat and light, and around 
the equator, the climate is generally hot”. 

As they are talking, Pema is keenly observing her grandmother 
cooking thukpa (a traditional Sikkimese dish) in a large metal 
pan. Pema asks, “Why are cooking utensils generally made of 
metals?” Palden immediately responds that they had studied

How does heat get 
transferred in these 
materials?

Let us perform an activity to learn why certain materials are 
good conductors of heat.

a teacher or an adult.

of wax such that they are arranged at 
nearly equal distances (about 2 cm apart),

the strip or will they fall?

 Predict the order in which the pins will fall from the strip. 
 Record your observations in Table 7.1.

You observed that the pin closest to the candle flame (pin I) 

falls first, followed by pins II, III, and IV. Why does pin I fall before 
pin II? Why did all the pins not fall together? 

From your observations, what can you infer? Do you think 
that heat is being transferred along the metal strip from the 
end that is being heated? As the heat travels along the strip and 
approaches a pin, the wax holding it melts and the pin falls. Here, 
the transfer of heat takes place from the hot end of the strip to the 
colder end. The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of 
an object to the colder part is called conduction. In this process, 
the particle that gets heated, passes the heat on to its neighbour, 
and so on. However, the particles themselves do not move from 
their positions. 

Materials like metals that allow heat to pass through them 
easily are called good conductors of heat. Because metals are 
good conductors of heat, we use utensils made of metals for 
cooking. In solids, heat transfer takes place mainly through the 
process of conduction.

If we use a strip made of a material like wood or glass in place 
of a metal strip to perform Activity 7.1, the pins will not fall. Can 
you think of the reason for this based on our learning from the 
chapter ‘The World of Metals and Non-Metals’?

allow heat to pass through them easily and Now, I know, why we

Does your list include air? If it is there on the list, where have 
you placed it? 

You must have experienced that during winters, we prefer 
wearing woollen clothes to keep ourselves warm.

Chapter 7.indd   91 4/3/2025   4:53:57 PM

 Heat Transfer in Nature



Woollen fabric traps air in its pores 
and as air is a poor conductor of heat, 
it reduces heat flow from our bodies to 

Air our surroundings. As a result, we feel 
warm. Similarly, air trapped between 
the layers of clothing acts as a poor 
conductor of heat and keeps us warm. 
The presence of air between two thin 
blankets is the reason why we prefer 

Fig. 7.2: Air trapped between two thin blankets them over one thick blanket to keep 
acts as an insulator us warm (Fig. 7.2).

Is it possible to construct houses that are not affected much 
by the outside heat and cold? Houses constructed in places with 
a very hot or cold climate often use the concept of heat transfer 
to keep them cool or warm.

FASCINATING FACTS
The upper regions of the Himalayas, such as the Mori block of Uttarkashi 
in Uttarakhand, experience an extremely cold climate and heavy 
snowfall during winters. Houses here are often built to stay warm 
during winters, with walls made of two wooden layers filled with cow 
dung and mud between them. As wood and mud are poor conductors 
of heat, they prevent heat loss and help in keeping the houses warm.

There are houses with outer walls that are constructed using 
hollow bricks that keep them warm in winters and cool in 
summers. This happens because the air that gets trapped in the 
hollow bricks is a poor conductor of heat.

Observation about the cups Probable reasons for the observation

You observed that the cup under which the candle 
was placed, rises up (Fig. 7.3b). Why is it so? The air 
around the candle flame heats up. As the air in the 
cup warms up, it expands and occupies more space. Inflated 
As a result, it becomes lighter and rises up. balloon

You can experience the expansion of air on 
heating it by placing a partially inflated balloon in 
the Sun (Fig. 7.4). After the air in the balloon gets 
heated, it expands and the balloon becomes larger. 

You must have observed that when an incense Fig. 7.4: An inflated 
balloon in the Sun

stick (agarbatti) is burnt, smoke rises up. Smoke is a 
mixture of hot gases and tiny solid particles that are released 
when something burns. As it is warmer than the surrounding air, 
it rises up.

 Observe the movement of the coloured streak in the 
Straw water.

Beaker  As you supply heat, a streak of colour starts moving 
Water up and then coming down from the sides (Fig. 7.5b).
Tripod Why does the streak of coloured water go up in the 

stand middle and come down from the sides? The water at the 
Candle bottom of the beaker gets heated up and becomes hot. 

It expands, becomes lighter, and rises. The water on the 
Fig. 7.5(a): Initial set-up sides of the beaker is comparatively cooler and heavier, 

for demonstration and comes down to take the place of the rising water. 
Then, this water gets heated and in turn also rises.

This cycle continues until the entire volume of water 
Coloured gets heated. In this case, the entire volume of water gets 

streak heated through the actual movement of water particles. 
This process of heat transfer is known as convection. It 
is because of convection that we see the movement of the 

Burning 
candle coloured streak inside the beaker.

Thus, we can conclude that water, like air, gets heated 
up by the process of convection. Here, heat transfer takes

convection in heated water gases from one place to another. 

7.2.1 Land and Sea Breeze
Palden shares his experience of visiting a beach in Kerala during 
winter vacation and says, “During the day, the sand or soil near 
the beach is hotter than the water in the sea. However, at night, 
the sand or soil is cooler than the water.” Pema replies, “Yes, 
different objects get heated and cooled differently.” 
Let us check how land and water get heated and cooled by 
performing an activity. 

Activity 7.4: Let us investigate
Caution— This activity should be carried out on a clear, 
sunny day under the supervision of a teacher or an adult.

halfway with water. 

Thermometer  Fix a laboratory thermometer in each bowl as 
shown in Fig. 7.6. Make sure that the bulbs of the 

Soil Water thermometer are immersed in soil and water, and 
do not touch the bottoms or the sides of the bowls.

 Study the rise in temperature of soil and water.
 Did the temperature rise by the same amount for both the 

soil and the water at the same time?
 If not, which one got heated faster?
 How much was the rise in temperature of the soil and the 

water in 20 minutes?
After 20 minutes, you will find that the temperature of the 

soil rises more than that of the water. This indicates that the soil 
heats up faster than water. 

Does the soil also cool faster than water? After letting the soil 
and water get heated, bring the set-up indoors and let it cool for 
20 minutes. You will observe that 
the soil cools faster than water, 
just as it gets heated faster. Warm air

People living in coastal 
areas experience an interesting 
phenomenon caused by the 
heating and cooling of land and 
water at different rates. As the 
land gets heated faster than water Warmer 
during the day, it causes warm Cool sea breeze land
air above the land to rise. This Cooler sea
causes cooler air to move from 
the sea towards the land. This 
movement of cooler air from the Fig. 7.7(a): Sea breeze
sea to the land is called sea breeze 
(Fig. 7.7a). Hence, in hot places, sea breeze relieves people from 
the heat. That is why, windows of the houses in coastal areas are 
placed facing the sea.

At night, the process 
Warm air reverses. In the absence of 

sunlight, land cools down 
faster than the water in the 
sea. As a result, the air above 
the sea is warmer and rises 
up. Cooler air from the land

the fireplace? They felt warm.

Their grandfather tells them that the

fire reaches us? process known as radiation. The heat of the 

Sun reaches us through this process. Heat 
transfer by radiation does not require any medium. 

All objects radiate heat. You must have observed that a hot 
utensil kept away from the flame cools down after some time. 
What is the reason for it? The hot utensil cools down by radiating 
heat to its surroundings.

DIVE Why is it more comfortable to wear white or light-coloured 
EEPER clothes during summers and dark-coloured clothes during 

winters? 

Light-coloured clothes reflect most of the heat that falls on 
them, and therefore, we feel more comfortable wearing 
them during summers. Dark surfaces, on the other hand, 
absorb more heat, and therefore, we feel more comfortable 
with dark-coloured clothes during winters.

97
There are many examples in our daily life, where we can 

observe conduction, convection, and radiation happening 
together.

Consider the case of water being heated up, as 
shown in Fig. 7.8. Let us identify the various ways in 
which the pan and the water get heated up, as well 
as the warmth we feel around the flame and the hot 
pan. Heat is transferred from the flame to the utensil 
by conduction. Subsequently, water in the utensil 
gets heated up by convection. The warmth that we 
feel around the flame and the hot utensil is due to Fig. 7.8: Heating water in a pan

radiation.
Let us wrap up!
From the activities, examples, and discussions so far, we find that 
there are three processes by which heat gets transferred. These 
are conduction, convection, and radiation. 
 In conduction, heating takes place when one particle receives 

heat, transfers heat to the next particle in contact, and so 
on. The particles themselves do not move away from their 
positions.

 In convection, heat transfer takes place by the actual 
movement of particles. 

 Note that in conduction and convection, a medium must be 
present whose particles help in the transfer of heat. 

 In the case of radiation, heat travels from one place to 
another and no material medium is required for its transfer.

FASCINATING FACTS
In the upper reaches of the Himalayan 
region, a traditional room heater locally 
known as bukhari is used to keep rooms 
warm during winters. It consists of an iron 
stove in which wood or charcoal is burnt. 
A long pipe attached to the upper part of 
the heater serves as a chimney, venting 
out the smoke. Additionally, the bukhari
can be used for cooking, as its flat top 
provides a platform for placing utensils. 
All the three processes of heat transfer 
are involved when this device is used for 
cooking and warming up the room. Bukhari

 Heat Transfer in Nature



You have learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, that 
the Sun is the main source of heat for the Earth. You have seen 
your parents drying wet clothes on the clothesline at home. Wet 
clothes dry faster on a sunny day since the heat from the Sun 
makes the evaporation of water faster. 

Thus, heat from the Sun plays an important role in the 
evaporation of water, be it from clothes drying on a line or from 
water bodies like oceans and lakes. Let us look at the phenomenon 
of water cycle to understand this in more detail.

7.4 Water Cycle
You have also learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, 
that water exists in three states in nature. As a liquid, it fills 
the oceans, rivers, and lakes on the Earth. As a solid, it forms 
snow, ice sheets, and glaciers in the mountains and the polar 
regions. As a gas, it exists in the form of water vapour in the 
Earth’s atmosphere. During summers, some of the snow and 
ice gets converted to water due to the Sun’s radiation and flows 
down as rivers, and ultimately into the oceans. The melted ice is 
replenished by fresh snow during winters. 

Water in the oceans, 
rivers, and lakes gets 

Sun heated due to the Sun, and 
as a result, it evaporates 

Condensation Precipitation as water vapour. Water 
also evaporates from 
trees and plants through 
transpiration. 

Evaporation Transpiration When water vapour 
rises up, it cools down 
and condenses to form 
clouds. Clouds bring 
rain, snow, and hail. 
This process is called 

Fig. 7.9: Water cycle precipitation. 
The continuous movement of water — upward as water vapour 

and downward through precipitation, passing through soil, rocks, 
and plants, and finally returning to water bodies, is called water 
cycle (Fig. 7.9). Thus, the water cycle helps in redistributing and 
replenishing water in rivers, lakes, and oceans. It also serves to 
conserve the total amount of water on the Earth. Rainwater that 
falls on the surface of the Earth, flows into ponds, lakes, rivers, 
and oceans or seeps into the ground.

Varahamihira was an astronomer and mathematician of the 
sixth century CE in Ujjaini (modern-day Ujjain), Madhya Pradesh. 
In his work Brihatsamhita, he gave methods for predicting seasonal 
rainfall. His predictions of seasonal rainfalls were based on factors, 
such as cloud formation, wind patterns, position of stars and the 
moon, and other natural phenomena.

Do your findings match with your predictions?
You may have observed that water seeps fastest through 

Open 
spaces gravel, slower through sand, and slowest through clay. Why 

is it so? The spaces between gravel particles are wider when 
compared to those in sand and clay. Hence, water can seep 
through the gravel more easily. In this way, water seeps 
beneath the surface of the Earth. This process of surface water 
seeping through soil and rocks is called infiltration. Water 
can infiltrate more readily if the spaces between soil and 
rock particles are wider, open, and interconnected (Fig. 7.11).

The water that seeps through gets stored in the pore spaces 
Gravel of sediments and the openings in rocks beneath the surface 

as groundwater. The underground layers of sediments and 
Soil rocks that store water in pore spaces are called aquifers 

(Fig. 7.12). This is the water we extract by digging wells or 
drilling bore wells into aquifers. This water may be a few 
metres to hundreds of metres below the ground, depending

However, groundwater is not unlimited. The growing water 

requirements of an increasing population have led to excessive 
groundwater extraction. Additionally, decreased vegetation cover 
and increased concrete surfaces in urban areas have limited 
water infiltration. As a result, groundwater is getting depleted. 
To address this, rainwater harvesting and recharge pits are used 
to replenish groundwater. Hence, the water cycle ensures that 
groundwater sources are recharged, thereby helping to ensure a 
sustainable groundwater supply.

Since water scarcity makes life difficult, people have 

developed different ways to conserve water. For example, in 
Ladakh, people have developed innovative ways to conserve 
water by making ice stupas (Fig. 7.13) during the winters.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Ice Stupa
During the spring season in 
Ladakh, streams often dry 
up, leading to scarcity of 
water as the heat from the 
Sun’s radiation is not enough 
to melt the snow on the 
mountains. During winters, 
water from mountain 
streams is channeled down 
through underground pipes. 
This water is then sprayed 
into the cold air. As it falls, it Fig. 7.13: Ice stupa
freezes due to extremely low 
temperatures. 

The ice builds up layer by layer, creating a tall, cone-shaped 
structure called an ice stupa as shown in Fig. 7.13. The ice stupa 
melts slowly during spring, providing water for farming and other 
needs throughout the summer.

In a Nutshell

 There are three ways in which heat is transferred from one 
place to another — conduction, convection, and radiation.

 The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of an object 
to a colder part is called conduction. In this process, particles 
do not move from their positions.

 Materials that allow heat to pass through them easily are 
called good conductors of heat.

 Materials that do not allow heat to pass through them easily 
are called poor conductors (insulators) of heat.

 In solids, heat is mainly transferred through the process of 
conduction. In liquids and gases, heat is transferred by the 
process of convection. 

Chapter 7.indd   101 4/3/2025   4:54:07 PM

8 Measurement of 
Time and Motion

Prerna and her younger sister are watching a sports channel 
on television. Prerna enjoys running and she has been declared 
the fastest runner among the girls in her district for winning 
the 100 metre sprint at an interschool competition held at the 
district level. She is now training to compete at the state level. 
She dreams of representing India at the international level in 100 
metre sprint contests in future. 

While watching the rerun of sprints at the Olympic games held 
in the past, Prerna is always amazed that the measurement of 
the time taken for the race is so advanced that they could identify 
the winner even when two sprinters seemed to cross the finish 
line almost together. However, in her school, the sports teacher 
only used a special kind of watch called a ‘stopwatch’ for timing 
the school races. She had noticed her mother wearing a watch on 
her wrist and her sister looking at her mobile phone when she 
needed to check the time. Her uncle used a Braille watch and had 
recently acquired a talking watch that announced the time at the 
touch of a button. There was also a large clock on the wall near 
the school entrance. Her thoughts turned to people in the ancient 
past, who did not have the modern gadgets we have today and 
she wondered…

How was time 
measured when there 
were no clocks and 
watches?

8.1 Measurement of Time

Humans got interested in keeping track of time long ago. They 
started noticing that many events in nature repeat themselves 
after definite intervals of time. For example, the rising and setting 
of the Sun, the phases of the Moon and the changing seasons. 
They started using the cycles of these events for timekeeping. 
First, they devised calendars. A day was defined by the cycle of 
rising and setting of the Sun. Then began the quest to find ways 
of knowing the time of day. 

So, they made many devices which 
helped them to measure smaller intervals 
of time within a day. Some of these were 
sundials, water clocks, hourglasses, and 
candle clocks. 

In a sundial, time is determined with 
the changing position of the shadow of an 
object cast by the light of the Sun during 

Fig. 8.1 A sundial the day (Fig. 8.1).
The water clocks used the flow of water 

out or into a vessel to measure time. In 
one type, water flowed out from a vessel 
which had markings for time (Fig. 8.2a). In 
the other type, there would be a bowl, with 
a fine hole at the bottom, which was 

(a) (b) floated on the surface of water (Fig. 8.2b). 
Fig. 8.2 A water clock (a) Water flowing out-type It gradually filled up in a fixed time and 

(b) Floating bowl-type finally sank. Then, it was lifted up and 
floated again. 

In an hourglass (Fig. 8.3), time was 
measured on the basis of the flow of sand 
from one bulb to another.

Candle clocks (Fig. 8.4) were candles 
with markings that indicated the passage 
of time when burned.

FASCINATING FACTS
The world’s largest stone sundial, 
the Samrat Yantra, was built 
around 300 years ago at the Jantar 
Mantar, in Jaipur, Rajasthan, 
a UNESCO World Heritage site 
that houses several astronomical 
instruments. With its imposing 
height of 27 metres, its shadow 
moves at about 1 millimetre per 
second and falls on a scale finely marked to measure time intervals as 
short as 2 seconds. Like any sundial, it measures local or ‘solar time’, 
requiring a correction to determine Indian Standard Time.

Should we make a simple water clock?

Activity 8.1: Let us construct

 Take a used transparent plastic  bottle (1/2 litre or larger) 
with its cap.

 Cut it into two, roughly in the middle as shown in Fig. 8.5a.
 Using a drawing pin, make a small hole in the cap of the 

bottle (Fig. 8.5b).

Fig. 8.5: Making a simple water clock

 Place the upper part of the bottle in an inverted position over 
the lower half (Fig. 8.5c).

 Fill the upper part of the bottle with water. You may add a 
few drops of ink or colour to make the water level easily 
visible (Fig. 8.5d). 

 The water will start dripping into the lower part of the bottle. 
Using a watch, mark the level of water after every one minute 
till all the water drips down.

Your water clock is ready. Can you now guess how to use it? 
Pour the water from the lower part back into the top part and 
watch the level of water dripping into the lower part. Every time 
it touches a mark made by you, one more minute has passed.

Measurement of Time and Motion



FASCINATING FACTS
In ancient India, time was measured using both shadows and water 
clocks. The earliest reference to shadow-based time measurement 
appears in the Arthasastra by Kautilya (was composed and revised 
between the second century BCE – third century CE). An accurate 
expression for time in terms of the shadow of a vertical stick was 
given by Varahamihira around 530 CE. The water clock with water 
flowing out was described in the Arthasastra, Sardulakarnavadana, 
and some other texts (early CE centuries). These clocks were not very 
accurate because as water levels dropped, the flow rate decreased. 
This led to the development of the sinking bowl water clock 
(Fig. 8.2b), or Ghatika-yantra, first mentioned by Aryabhata, and then 
in several astronomical texts later. Time was measured constantly 
with Ghatika-yantra at Buddhist monasteries, royal palaces, town 
squares, and each time the bowl sank, it was announced by drums, 
conch shells, or striking a gong. Though the Ghatika-yantra was 
progressively replaced by pendulum clocks in the late nineteenth 
century, it continued to be used at the religious places for rituals.

As human civilisation advanced, and 
as people began to travel long distances, 
the measurement of time became very 
critical. This led to the development of 
increasingly better mechanical devices 
for the measurement of time, driven 
by weights, gears, and springs from the 
fourteenth century onwards. However, 

Pendulum the invention of the pendulum clock 
in the seventeenth century marked 

Fig. 8.6: Huygens’ a major breakthrough in mechanical 
Pendulum clock timekeeping.

KNOW A SCIENTIST
The pendulum clock was invented in 1656 and patented in 1657 by 
Christiaan Huygens (1629 –1695). He was inspired by the investigations 
of pendulums by Galileo Galilei (1564 –1642). It is said that once while 
sitting in a church, Galileo’s attention was drawn to a lamp suspended 
from the ceiling, which was swinging back and forth. Using his pulse 
to measure time, Galileo found that the lamp took the same time for 
each swing. After experimenting with different pendulums, Galileo 
concluded that the time taken to complete one oscillation was always 
the same for a pendulum of a given length.

8.1.1 A simple pendulum
A simple pendulum We did an activity in the chapter 
consists of a small ‘Measurement of Length and Motion’ 
metallic ball (called the in the Grade 6 Science textbook 
bob of the pendulum) Curiosity, where we observed the 
suspended from a rigid oscillatory motion of an eraser hung 
support by a long thread with a thread. Is the pendulum 
as shown in Fig. 8.7a. similar to that?

Fig. 8.7 A simple pendulum

The pendulum at rest is in its mean position. When the bob of 
the pendulum is moved slightly to one side and released, it starts 
oscillatory motion. Its motion is periodic in nature because it 
repeats its path after a fixed interval of time. 

The pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when 
its bob, starting from its mean position O, moves to extreme 
position A, changes direction and moves to another extreme 
position B, changes direction and comes back to O (Fig. 8.7b). The 
pendulum also completes one oscillation when its bob moves 
from one extreme position A to another extreme position B and 
comes back to A. The time taken by the pendulum to complete 
one oscillation is called its time period. Let us now set up a 
pendulum and measure its time period.

Activity 8.2: Let us experiment

 Collect a piece of string around 150 cm long, a heavy metal 
ball with hook/ a stone (bob), a stopwatch/ watch, and a ruler.

 Tie the bob at one end of the string. 
 Fix the other end of the string to a rigid support such that the 

length of the string in between support and bob is around 
100 cm. 

 Wait for the bob to come to rest. Your pendulum is now 
ready.

Chapter 8.indd   109 4/3/2025   4:54:35 PM

Measurement of Time and Motion



 Gently hold the bob, move it slightly to one side and release 
it. Take care not to push the bob while releasing it and that 
the string is taut. Is your pendulum now oscillating?

 Using a watch, measure the time it takes for the pendulum 
to complete 10 oscillations. Record the time in Table 8.1.

 Repeat this activity 3–4 times.
 Divide the time taken for 10 oscillations by 10 to calculate

the time period of your pendulum. Note it down in Table 8.1.

Is the time period of your pendulum almost the same every 
time? What do you conclude from this observation? The time 
period of the pendulum is almost the same every time.

THINK LIKE A SCIENTIST!
You just did an important historical experiment which was first done 
by Galileo, except you used a watch to measure time in place of your 
pulse beat. Suppose you were Galileo experimenting with pendulums, 
what all would you investigate? What questions could you ask? Would 
all pendulums have the same time period? How would you test this? 

Repeat Activity 8.2 using the same bob but with pendulums of two 
or three different lengths. Does the time period change? If so, how does 
the length affect it? If changing the length influences the time period, 
does the bob’s mass also matter? Test this by repeating Activity 8.2 
with a fixed pendulum length but with bobs of different mass. Do you 
observe any change?

The time period of a simple pendulum depends on its length but 
not on the bob’s mass. All pendulums of the same length have the same 
time period at a given location.

The time period of a simple pendulum of a given length is 
constant at a place. This property is used in the measurement of 
time.

All clocks, old or modern, are based on some process repeating 

continuously, which can be used to mark equal intervals of time. 

Modern clocks measure time using the same basic principle — 
periodically repeating processes — but use tiny and very rapid 
vibrations either from a quartz crystal (quartz clocks) or from some DIVE

EEPER
specific atoms (atomic clocks). While Huygens’ early pendulum 
clocks could gain or lose 10 seconds each day, today’s atomic clocks 
are so precise that they lose only one second in millions of years! 
Scientists are constantly searching for even better ways to measure 
time with greater accuracy.

Fig. 8.8: Some common clocks and watches

8.1.2 SI unit of time
The SI unit of time is the second. Its symbol is s. The larger units 
of time are minute (min) and hour (h).

60 s = 1 min 60 min = 1 h

DIVE Units of time, such as second, minute, and hour begin with a 
EEPER lowercase letter, except at the beginning of a sentence. Their 

symbols ‘s’, ‘min’, and ‘h’ are also written in lowercase letters 
and in singular. Note that a full stop is not written after the 
symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the time, 
always leave a space between the number and the unit. Also, 
note that writing ‘sec’ for second and ‘hrs’ for hour is incorrect.

FASCINATING FACTS
The hole in the bowl of Ghatika-yantra was made in such a manner 
that it took 24 minutes to fill and sink. The time unit measured by this 
clock was called ghatika or ghati. It became the standard unit of time 
measurement and continued until the end of the nineteenth century. 
A 24-hour-long day was, thus, divided into 60 equal ghatis.

 Look at the wall clock shown in Fig. 8.9 carefully. 
What is the smallest interval of time you can 
measure with it? 

One second is the smallest interval of time that we can 
Fig. 8.9: A wall clock measure using this clock.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
In today’s world, measuring tiny fractions of a second is very 
important! For example, in sports, timekeeping devices can 
record events down to one-hundredth or even one-thousandth of 
a second (a millisecond) to determine the winners in a race. In 
medicine, heart monitors like Electrocardiogram (ECG) machines 
measure the millisecond variations in heartbeats to detect health 
issues. In music, digital recordings capture sound thousands of 
times per second for smooth playback. Many devices use even 
shorter intervals, smartphones, and computers process signals 
in microseconds (one-millionth of a second), allowing them 
to operate very fast. Scientists continue to develop even more 
precise time-measuring tools for space exploration, medicine, and 
advanced science experiments. The faster and more accurate our 
clocks become, the more they help society in ways we may not 
even notice!

For races covering the same 
distance, we can tell who was 
faster by measuring time. But how 
can we tell that when comparing 
races for different distances?

8.2 Slow or Fast
What do we mean when we say something is moving fast or 
slow? Suppose you are watching a 100 metre race on a straight 
track. All the players begin from the starting line together but 
after sometime they are not running together (Fig. 8.10). How do 
you decide who is running faster amongst them?

113

Fig. 8.10: Boys running a race on a straight track
Someone who is ahead of others at some instant of time, is 

running faster than them. Hence, someone who has covered 
more distance within the same time is running faster.

The distances moved by objects in a given interval of time 
decide which one is faster or slower. We often say that the faster 
runner has a higher speed. You are probably familiar with the 
word ‘speed’. 

8.3 Speed
By comparing the distances moved by two or more objects in a 
unit time, it can be found out which of them is moving faster. The 
unit time may be one second or one minute or one hour. We call 
the distance covered by an object in a unit time as the speed of 
the object.

How can we determine the speed of an object? It can be 
calculated, if we know the total distance covered by an object 
and the time taken to cover it. The speed of an object is the total 
distance covered divided by the total time taken to cover it. Thus,

Speed = Total distance covered
 Total time taken

What would be the unit of speed? We know the SI units of 
length and time. Since the speed is distance/time, the SI unit of 
speed is metre/second and is expressed as m/s. 

Speed can also be expressed in other units. If we express the 
distance in kilometre and time in hour, then the unit of speed is 
kilometre/hour, expressed as km/h.

 Compare the speeds of the trains. Which is the fastest train? 

The train which has covered the maximum distance in unit time 
is the fastest train, that is, the one with the highest speed. 

8.3.1 Relationship between speed, distance, 
and time
We already know how to calculate speed using 

Speed = Total distance covered
 Total time taken
if the distance travelled and time taken for it are known to us.
We can write this equation in a different form to calculate the 
distance covered by an object, if we know its speed and the time 
taken, by using 

Total distance covered = Speed × Total time taken
Similarly, we can also calculate the time an object will take to 
cover a distance, if the distance and speed are given, by using

Total time taken = Total distance covered
               Speed

Example 8.2: Raghav is going to a neighbouring city in a bus 
moving at a speed of 50 km/h. If it takes him 2 h to reach that 
city, how far is that city?
Solution: Distance covered by bus = Speed × Time

                                                               = km
50 ×2h

h
                                                              = 100 km
Example 8.3: A train is travelling at a speed of 90 km/h. How 
much time will it take to cover a distance of 360 km? 

Solution: Time taken by the train = Distance covered
Speed

360km
                                                             = 

km
90

h

                                                             = 4 h
In all the examples so far, we have found the speed of an 

object by using ‘the total distance covered divided by the total 
time taken’. However, the object might not have travelled with 
the same speed during the entire duration of time. The object 
might have sometimes moved slower or sometimes faster. So, the 
speed that we have calculated is the average speed, but, in this 
book, we have used the term ‘speed’ for ‘average speed’.

Measurement of Time and Motion



SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Vehicles such as scooters, 
motorbikes, cars, and buses have 
an instrument which measures and 
displays the vehicle’s speed in km/h. 
It is called a speedometer. Another Speedometer
instrument, known as an odometer, Odometer
is also fitted in the vehicles that 
measures the distance travelled by 
the vehicle in kilometre.

I once watched a part of marathon on a straight 
road stretch. I noticed that some people seemed to 
be running at the same speed during that distance 
while some people would speed up or slow down. 
How were their motion different?

8.4 Uniform and Non-uniform Linear Motion

Do you remember learning about linear motion in the chapter 
‘Measurement of Length and Motion’ in the Grade 6 Science 
textbook Curiosity? When an object moves along a straight line, 
its motion is called linear motion. Now, imagine a train on a 
track which is along a straight line between two adjacent railway 
stations. So, the motion of the train between these two stations is 
an example of linear motion (Fig. 8.11). The train starts from the 
first station A at a slow speed, then moves at a faster speed, then 
slows down and comes to a halt at the next station D. In between 
the two stations, for some distance (B to C), the train moves at a 
constant speed, that is, at an unchanging speed. 

A B C D

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7



117
An object moving along a straight line with a constant speed 

is said to be in uniform linear motion. So, the train is in uniform 
motion between B and C (Fig. 8.11). On the other hand, if the speed 
of an object moving along a straight line keeps changing, it is said 
to be in non-uniform linear motion. The motion of the train 
between A and B, as well as between C and D, is non-uniform 
(Fig. 8.11).

An object in uniform linear motion covers equal distances 
in equal intervals of time, while it covers unequal distances in 
equal intervals of times when it is in non-uniform linear motion. 
In Table 8.3, data are given for the distances travelled by two 
trains, X and Y, between the time 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM.

Table 8.3:  Distances travelled by two trains in equal time intervals 
of 10 minutes

10:40 80 20 75 25
10:50 100 20 95 20

11:00 120 20 120 25

Which of the two trains is in uniform linear motion between 
10:00 AM and 11:00 AM? Train X covers equal distances in equal 
intervals of time, so it is in uniform linear motion while Train Y 
is in non-uniform linear motion.

Uniform linear motion is an idealisation. In everyday life, 
we seldom find objects moving with a constant speed over long 
distances or for long intervals of time. That is why we have to use 
average speeds.

9 Life Processes 
in Animals

If your food is fully digested before you eat again, you won’t need medicine for pain.
(Thirukkural 942)

In the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, chapter ‘Living 
Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’, we learnt about 
processes essential for survival of living beings like nutrition, 
respiration, excretion, and reproduction. These are collectively 
called life processes. In this chapter, we will learn about life 
processes such as nutrition and respiration in detail.

Chapter 9.indd   121 4/3/2025   4:55:07 PM



Observe your surroundings and notice what animals eat. 
Animals eat different types of food. Bees and sunbirds suck the nectar 
of flowers, while infants of humans and many other animals feed on 
their mother’s milk. Snakes, like python, swallow the animals they 
prey upon. Some aquatic animals filter tiny food particles floating 
nearby and feed upon them. 

Animals, including humans, obtain 
energy from food, which enables them to 
carry out various life processes. Animals 

Mouth consume food that contains complex 
components, such as carbohydrate, protein, 
and fat. These complex food components 
have to be broken down into simpler forms 

Oesophagus before the body can use them. But how does 
or Food pipe this process happen? 

Breaking down of complex food 
Liver components into simpler forms occurs in a 
Stomach long tube called the alimentary canal. This 

Pancreas process starts in the mouth and ends at the 
anus (Fig. 9.1). As food moves through this 

Small intestine canal, digestive juices secreted at different 
Large intestine parts break it down into simpler forms. 
Rectum This simpler form of food is absorbed by 

Anus different parts of our alimentary canal and 
transported to various parts of our body to 
carry out various functions.

Fig. 9.1: Human digestive system

9.1 Nutrition in Animals  
How do the complex food components get broken down into 
simpler forms and used by the body in various animals? Is this 
process the same in all animals or does it vary? Let us first try to 
understand this process in humans.

9.1.1 Digestion in human beings
Let us trace the journey of food inside our body as it passes 
through different parts of the alimentary canal.
Beginning with the mouth cavity
The journey of the food you eat begins when it enters your 
mouth. Your teeth break down food you eat into smaller pieces 
by the processes of crushing and chewing. This process of initial 
breakdown of food into fine pieces is called mechanical digestion. 
Think about your favourite food. Does your mouth feel watery? 

122

123
This happens because of more saliva that gets released when you 
recall your favourite food.

What do you think is the role of saliva in your mouth? What 
do you feel when you eat other types of food, such as chapati? Let 
us find out.

Take a small piece of chapati or a bite-sized portion of boiled 
rice and chew it properly for 30–60 seconds. At first, the chapati
or rice has its usual taste, but as you continue chewing, do you 
notice a change in taste? The food begins to taste sweet! Have you 
ever wondered why this happens?

Chapati or rice contains starch, which is a type of carbohydrate. 
Our saliva contains a digestive juice that helps break down starch 
into sugar. This explains why starchy food, like chapati, tastes 
sweet when you chew it for a long time. Saliva helps to break 
down components of food into simpler ones.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
A healthy mouth requires good oral hygiene. We should brush our 
teeth and clean our tongue twice a day, and rinse our mouth with 
water after each meal to prevent tooth decay and bad smell in the 
mouth. Find out the ways our elders were maintaing oral hygiene. 

Activity 9.1: Let us investigate

 Take two test tubes and label them as ‘A’ and ‘B’. 
 Take one teaspoonful of boiled rice in test tube A, and take a 

teaspoonful of boiled rice after chewing it for 30–60 seconds 
in test tube B. 

 Add 3–4 mL of water in both the test tubes. 
 Note the initial colour of the rice-water mixture in Table 9.1.
 Add 3–4 drops of iodine solution into each test tube with the 

help of a dropper. Mix the content of each test tube separately 
and observe. 

Record your observations in Table 9.1.

Life Processes in Animals



Did you observe that the colour of boiled rice turned blue-black 
in test tube A, while in test tube B, chewed boiled rice either did 
not change colour or turned only a very light blue-black colour? 
What causes the change of colour in test tube A? In Grade 6, we 
learned that iodine gives a blue-black colour when it reacts with 
starch. In test tube A, the appearance of the blue-black colour 
indicates the presence of starch. In test tube B, which contains 
chewed boiled rice, if there is no change in colour, it indicates 
that the starch is no longer present; if there is only a slight 
change in colour, it indicates that starch is present only in very 
small amount. It has been broken down into simple sugars by 
the action of saliva. If the colour still appears in test tube B, what 
changes would you make in the activity to explore it further? 
Would the colour change if chewing time is increased? Try to 
find out by repeating the activity.

Now, we know that saliva secretion in the mouth helps break 
down starch into sugars. This process of breaking complex food 
components into simpler forms in the body is called digestion. Food 
is partially digested in the mouth. Let us learn how this partially 
digested food gets further digested through the alimentary canal. 
Food pipe (Oesophagus): A passage from the mouth to the 
stomach

Site of contraction When you chew your food, your 
saliva not only helps in digesting 
the starch but also moistens 

Food it, making it soft and easy to 
swallow. Your tongue helps in

Stomach Stomach (Fig. 9.2). But how does the food 
Fig. 9.2: Movement of food in the food pipe move down? 

The walls of the food pipe gently contract and relax in a 
wave-like motion to push the food down into the stomach. This 
movement takes place throughout the alimentary canal and 
pushes the food forward.
Stomach
In the stomach, the walls contract and relax to churn the food. The 
churned food is then mixed with a secretion from the inner lining 
of the stomach. The secretion from stomach contains digestive juice, 
acid, and mucus.

125
The digestive juice of the stomach breaks 

down proteins present in the food into simpler Digestive juice, 
acid and mucus

components. 
The acid not only helps break down proteins 

but also kills many harmful bacteria. The mucus 
protects the stomach lining from the acid, preventing 
damage. In the stomach, the food is partially digested 
and transformed into a semi-liquid mass, preparing Stomach wall

it for the next stage of digestion. Fig. 9.3: Stomach

FASCINATING FACTS
How did scientists learn about digestion in the human body?

The discovery of how the stomach works happened 
by chance. In 1822, a man named Alexis St. Martin 
was accidentally shot in the stomach. He was treated 
by a doctor, William Beaumont. However, his wound 
never fully healed, leaving a small permanent hole. 
This opening allowed Dr. Beaumont to observe 

Alexis St. Martin’s digestion in the stomach as it happened. He conducted 
shotgun wound experiments on how different foods were broken 

down and studied how emotions affect digestion.

Small Intestine
After its journey through the stomach, the partially Mouth

Food pipe
digested food moves into the small intestine. Look (Oesophagus)
at Fig. 9.4. It is a sketch of a stretched-out alimentary 
canal. Guess how long it is. You will be surprised Stomach
that although it is called small intestine, it is almost 
6 metres long—almost twice the height of your Liver
classroom! You will be surprised to know that the Pancreas

small intestine is the longest part of the alimentary 
canal. Small 

The small intestine receives digestive secretions intestine
from three sources—the inner lining of the small 
intestine itself, and two more structures associated 
with the alimentary canal—the liver and the 
pancreas (Fig. 9.4). The liver secretes bile, which 
is mildly basic in nature. Recall the neutralisation Large 
reaction in chapter ‘Exploring Substances: Acidic, intestine
Basic, and Neutral’. Bile neutralises acids present 
in the food moving down from the stomach and Anus
breaks down fats into tiny droplets, making its 
digestion easier. Fig. 9.4: Alimentary canal if it is 

stretched out

Chapter 9.indd   125 4/3/2025   4:55:10 PM

Life Processes in Animals



The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice, which is also 
basic in nature and helps neutralise acids present in the food. 
Additionally, pancreatic juice also breaks down carbohydrates, 
proteins, and fats. The digestive juice secreted by the wall of the 
small intestine further breaks down fats, proteins, and partially 
digested carbohydrates into simpler forms. 

The digested nutrients pass on 
from the small intestine into the blood 
present in blood vessels found in the 
walls of the small intestine. This process 
is called absorption of nutrients. How 
are these nutrients absorbed from 
the small intestine? The inner lining 
of the small intestine is thin and has 
thousands of finger-like projections 

0.5 mm (Fig. 9.5) that increase the surface 
area for efficient nutrient absorption. 

Fig. 9.5: Inner lining of the small intestine These finger-like projections allow 
the digested nutrients to pass into the 

blood, which carries them to different parts of the body. These 
nutrients provide energy, support growth and repair, and help 
the body function properly. 

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Celiac disease is a condition in which the body reacts 
to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. 
This reaction damages the inner lining of the small 
intestine, where nutrients are absorbed. As a result, 
the intestine cannot function properly. The only way 
to manage celiac disease is to avoid foods that contain 
gluten. Millets (like jowar, bajra, and ragi) are good 
alternatives because they are naturally gluten-free.

Large intestine
After most of the nutrients are digested and absorbed in the 
small intestine, what happens to the undigested food? It moves 
into the large intestine. The large intestine is about 1.5 metres 
in length. It is shorter than the small intestine. Then why is it 
called the large intestine? The reason is that it is wider than the 

126

127
small intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and some salts 
from the undigested food, thus making the waste semi-solid. This 
semi-solid waste is called stool. The stool is then stored in the 
lower part of the large intestine, called the rectum, until the 
body is ready to get rid of it. Eating fibre-rich foods like fruits, 
vegetables, and whole grains helps the large intestine function 
properly by making the stool easier to pass. Finally, it is expelled 
through the anus—a process known as egestion. This is how your 
body removes the waste it does not need, keeping you healthy!

Isn’t it fascinating how the digestive system works, absorbing 
nutrients from food and eliminating waste?

FASCINATING FACTS
The large intestine contains various small living organisms, 
such as bacteria, that help in digestion. They help in keeping our 
digestive system healthy. They break down undigested food, 
especially fibre, and produce essential nutrients. Fibre-rich 
food, and especially ‘fermented foods’ (like curd, buttermilk, 
shrikhand, kanji, pickles, gundruk, and poita bhat) are good for 
a healthy digestive system and overall well-being.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
The importance of digestion in maintaining good health has been 
recognised for centuries. The  Charaka Samhita, an ancient Ayurvedic 
text, highlights the role of easily digestible foods and the judicious use 
of spices like ginger, black pepper, and cumin to enhance digestion. 
Advances in science in the area of nutrition also emphasise eating 
meals at proper timings, practising mindful eating, and avoiding 
overeating as key factors in maintaining digestive health.

9.1.2  Do all animals digest food the same way as 
humans do?

I have seen cows keep chewing 
the food even when they are 
not actively grazing or eating 
anything. Why?

Chapter 9.indd   127 4/3/2025   4:55:13 PM

Life Processes in Animals



Grass-eating animals, such as 
Small Intestine Pancreas Oesophagus cows (Fig. 9.6) and buffaloes, 

partially chew the grass 
and swallow it into their 
stomachs. In the stomach, 
partial digestion of the food 
takes place. The partially 
digested food is brought back 

Rumen to the mouth for gradual 
chewing. This process is 
called rumination, and these 
animals are called ruminants. 
A cow spends about 8 hours a 
day just chewing the food! The 
thoroughly chewed food again 

Fig. 9.6: Digestive system of a ruminant passes down the alimentary 
canal for further digestion.

but they have a chamber

often with the help of grit 
(small stones) that the birds 
swallow. Fig. 9.7: Digestive system in birds

This shows that animals exhibit variations in the structure 
and function of the alimentary canal to adapt to different ways 
of digesting different kinds of food. 

We have learnt that the nutrients from digested food are 
carried to different parts of the body. Some of the nutrients help 
build and repair the body, while others, like sugar, are broken 
down inside the body to release energy. The process by which 
nutrients are converted into usable energy is called respiration. 
Let us now explore how this process occurs in animals.

9.2 Respiration in Animals
We learnt in Grade 6 chapter ‘Living Creatures: Exploring their 
Characteristics’, that all living beings respire. Is the process of 
respiration the same in all animals? Let us first understand the 
process of respiration in humans.

9.2.1 Respiration in humans
You know that we breathe in (inhale) and breathe out (exhale) air 
continuously to obtain oxygen and release carbon dioxide. How 
is this oxygen used in the body? Are breathing and respiration 
different? Let us find out. 
How do we breathe?
The process of inhaling and exhaling air is called breathing. It is 
difficult to live without food for a week; without water for a day or 
two, but without breathing, we usually cannot survive more than a 
few minutes. Why is that? All of us are alive because we breathe. Not 
just humans, plants and other animals also breathe. But how do we 
breathe? 

Just as food follows a specific pathway in the digestive system, 
our body also has a specific system for breathing and respiration. 
This system is called respiratory system. The respiratory 
system consists of various parts as shown in Fig. 9.8. In this 
system, the exchange of gases follows a specific pathway. The 
pathway through which the air is inhaled and exhaled involves 
various parts of the respiratory system assisting in the process of 
breathing and respiration.

The respiratory system begins with a pair 
of nasal openings called nostrils through 
which we inhale and exhale air (Fig. 9.8). Nostrils
The inhaled air passes into a pair of small 
passages called the nasal passages. Have Windpipe
you noticed tiny hair inside your nostrils? Alveoli
These hair, along with mucus, help trap Left lung
dust and dirt from the air we breathe in. Right lung
This is why we should breathe through the 
nose and not through the mouth. From the Rib cage
nasal passages, the air reaches our lungs Diaphragm
through the windpipe. The windpipe forms 
two branches, which enter the two lungs. Fig. 9.8: Human respiratory system
In the lungs, these branches further divide into smaller and 
finer branches that end in small balloon-like sacs called alveoli 
(Fig. 9.8). Our lungs are protected by the rib cage. 

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
While a lot of the dust is filtered out from the inhaled air, often 
small infectious particles can get through the lungs. For example, 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus affected 
the respiratory system, leading to breathing difficulties and 
often causing serious lung problems.

Let us understand the mechanism of breathing by making a 
simple model.

Activity 9.2: Let us make a model 

 Take a wide transparent plastic 
bottle with a lid. Remove its 
bottom. 

 Make a hole in the lid of the bottle. 
 Take a Y-shaped hollow tube, as 

shown in Fig. 9.9. 
 Fix two deflated balloons to the 

forked end of the tube. Secure 
them with rubber bands to make 
them airtight. 

 Insert the straight end of the tube 
tightly through the lid from the (a) Inhalation (b) Exhalation
open base of the bottle and seal Fig. 9.9: Model to show 
the lid with clay to make it airtight. mechanisms of breathing

 To the open base of the bottle, attach a thin rubber sheet 
tightly using a large rubber band.

Pull the rubber sheet from the centre of the base downwards 
and watch the balloons (Fig. 9.9a). What do you observe? Now, 
release the rubber sheet upwards and observe the balloons 
(Fig. 9.9b). What changes do you see in the balloons? When you 
pull the rubber sheet downwards, the balloons inflate. Conversely, 
when you release the rubber sheet upwards, the balloons deflate.

Air is drawn in Air is forced out When you breathe 
in (inhale), your chest 

Ribs move expands as the ribs move

back up and outwards. The 
diaphragm (a dome-shaped 
muscle below the lungs)

the chest, and air enters the 
lungs. When you breathe

Breathing Practices for a Healthy Life
Breathing exercises have been practised across different cultures 
in India and worldwide for centuries. Pranayama is well known for 
improving respiratory health, mind relaxation, and concentration. 

In Ladakh, people practise Tummo breathing, 
a technique that improves lung function and 
helps keep the body warm even in cold weather. 
Similarly, deep breathing techniques are used to 
promote well-being. Some traditions combine deep 
breathing with chanting, using rhythmic breath 
control to enhance relaxation and mental clarity.

What do we breathe out?

 Do you observe any changes in the colour of the lime water? 
The lime water in test tube B turns milky (or cloudy), but the lime 
water in test tube A does not. What does this indicate? Lime water 
turns milky when it reacts with carbon dioxide. Therefore, this 
indicates that the exhaled air contains more carbon dioxide than 
the air we inhale.

Chapter 9.indd   131 4/3/2025   4:55:16 PM

Life Processes in Animals



How does the exchange of gases 
happen?

Alveoli Through the process of breathing, 
fresh air from outside enters the 

Carbon lungs and fills the alveoli. The alveoli 
dioxide have thin walls surrounded by fine 
Oxygen tubes containing blood (Fig. 9.12). 

Blood carries carbon dioxide from 
the body to the alveoli, where it is 

Blood vessel Alveolus released into the air. At the same 
time, oxygen from the alveoli passes 

Fig. 9.12: Gas exchange through alveoli into the blood and is transported to 
all parts of the body. 

Have you ever wondered how the food you eat gives you 
energy? The key is not only the food but also the oxygen we 
breathe! When we eat food, our body breaks it down into simple 
substances like sugar (glucose). Oxygen helps break down glucose 
to release energy. This process is called respiration. The word 
equation of the process of respiration is as follows—

Glucose + Oxygen  Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy
During breathing, 

we inhale air from 
Inhaled air Exhaled air our surroundings and 

Nearly 21% oxygen Nearly 16–17% 
oxygen exhale air having more 

carbon dioxide than 
the inhaled air. Note 
that not all the oxygen 

Nearly 0.04% Nearly 4–5% is used up (Fig. 9.13). 
carbon dioxide carbon dioxide Some other animals 

Lungs can use a larger 
fraction of the oxygen 
during respiration. 

Fig. 9.13: The percentage of oxygen and carbon This exchange of gases 
dioxide in inhaled and exhaled air ensures that each 

segment of our body gets oxygen to produce energy and remove 
waste products. In simple words, breathing brings in oxygen and 
removes carbon dioxide, while respiration uses oxygen to break 
down food and release energy. This energy helps us walk, run, 
play, and even think!

Breathing is a physical process, while respiration is a chemical 
process that occurs inside the body. Both the processes are 
essential for our survival!

133
Our body has a unique system for the transport of nutrients, 

oxygen, and other substances. This system is called the circulatory 
system. It includes the heart, blood, and blood vessels. The heart 
pumps blood through blood vessels, ensuring the transport of 
nutrients, oxygen, and other substances to all parts of the body, 
while waste products are carried away. 

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Smoking is extremely harmful to health. It damages the lungs and 
increases the risk of serious diseases, including lung cancer and 
other respiratory illnesses. It leads to persistent coughing and 
frequent infections.
 In addition to harming the smoker, smoking releases toxic 
chemicals into the air, putting others at risk. When non-smokers 
inhale this polluted air, they experience passive smoking, which 
can be especially dangerous for children, pregnant women, and 
the elderly. Due to these risks, avoiding smoking helps protect both 
personal health and the well-being of those around us.

9.2.2 Do other animals breathe the same way as 
humans do?

You have learnt that different animals Gills
live in different habitats. You may have 
observed birds flying and fish swimming. 
How do they breathe? Animals, such 
as birds, elephants, lions, cows, goats, 
lizards, and snakes, breathe through 
their lungs. Although all these animals 
have lungs, the structure of their lungs 
are quite different. Most aquatic animals 
like fish, have specialised structures Fig. 9.14: Breathing body parts in a fish
known as gills (Fig. 9.14). These are 
richly supplied with blood vessels. The exchange of oxygen and 
carbon dioxide between the blood and the gases dissolved in 
water takes place across the gills. 

Amphibians, like frogs, live both on land and in water. They 
use different body parts for breathing at various stages of their 
life. For example, tadpoles breathe through gills, while adult frogs 
use lungs for breathing on land and skin for gas exchange when 
they stay in water. This adaptation helps them survive both in 
water and on land, showing how animals have adapted over time 
to different environments. Earthworms use their moist skin for 
the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Life Processes in Animals



Thus, different animals have different breathing mechanisms 
to suit their unique habitats. Apart from the digestive system, the 
respiratory system, and the circulatory system, there are other 
systems which work in coordination with each other in the body 
and perform different functions to sustain life. You will study 
about them in higher grades.

In a Nutshell

 Life processes such as nutrition, circulation, respiration, 
excretion, and reproduction are essential for the survival 
of living beings. These processes are collectively called life 
processes.

 The human digestive system consists of an alimentary canal 
which includes the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small 
intestine, large intestine, and anus, and its associated parts, 
the liver and the pancreas. 

 The digested food is primarily absorbed through the walls of 
the small intestine. 

 The  nutrients absorbed are distributed through the blood 
to different parts of the body where they are used for 
performing various functions. 

 The large intestine absorbs most of the remaining water and 
some salts from the undigested food.

 Grass-eating animals such as cows and goats are called 
ruminants. They chew the food partially and swallow it. 
Later, the partially digested food is returned to the mouth, 
and the animal chews it thoroughly. 

 Breathing involves the movement of air into the lungs 
(inhalation) and out of the lungs (exhalation).

 The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the 
alveoli of the lungs.

 Respiration uses oxygen from inhaled air to break down 
glucose into carbon dioxide and water. The process by which 
nutrients are converted into usable energy is called respiration.

 The circulatory system transports nutrients  and oxygen to 
all parts of the body. It includes the heart, which  pumps 
blood through blood vessels, delivering oxygen and nutrients 
while also removing waste from the body.

 Breathing is a physical process and respiration is a chemical 
process.

 Different animals have different breathing mechanisms 
adapted to suit their habitats.

10 Life Processes 
in Plants

In Grade 6, we learnt that all living beings grow and need food 
for their growth. Also, in the previous chapter, we discussed the 
process through which animals obtain nutrition.  

We know that animals eat food to grow, but what about 
plants? Have you ever seen plants eating food like animals do? 
As animals grow, their size and weight usually increase, and their 
bodies undergo various changes. What changes do you notice in 
plants when they grow?

We learnt that food provides nutrients like carbohydrates, 
fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, which, along with water, 
are all essential for growth. Let us explore how plants obtain 
nutrients for their growth.

Chapter 10.indd   137 4/3/2025   4:55:45 PM



10.1 How Do Plants Grow?
Look around your neighbourhood. Have you observed any 
changes in a plant during its life span? As a plant grows, new 
leaves and branches emerge, its height increases, and its stem 
thickens. What do you think causes these changes? Discuss with 
your friends and provide your explanation as well. 

When we water plants 
regularly, they grow better. Maybe plants take

of  plants.

Let us perform an experiment to test some of these explanations. 

Activity 10.1: Let us test some explanations 

 Take three earthen pots (or used bottles/containers) of the 
same size filled with garden soil. Plant saplings of similar sizes 

of a fast-growing plant like chilli or 
tomato in each pot (Fig. 10.1).

 Label the pots A, B, and C.
 Count the number of leaves on 

each sapling and record your 
observations.

 Place pot C in the dark. Keep the soil in this pot slightly moist 

by adding an adequate amount of water every day (Fig. 10.1c).
 Observe the plants for two weeks1 and record changes in 

their height, number of leaves, colour of leaves, and any 
other changes that may appear.

 Record your observations in Table 10.1.

 What differences did you observe between the plants in the 
three pots? 

 Which pot has the plant with the maximum growth?
 Which pot has the plant with the least growth?

Analyse the observations recorded in Table 10.1, and discuss 
them with your teacher and friends.

You are likely to find that the plant in Pot A, kept in direct 
sunlight with adequate water, grows better than the plant in Pot 
C, which gets adequate water but no sunlight. The plant in Pot 
B may have died as it did not get water even though it received 
adequate sunlight.

What do you infer from the observations made in this activity? 
The results indicate that plants require both sunlight and water 
for their growth. 
1   This experiment will need two weeks. Teachers can plan this activity 

accordingly.

FASCINATING FACTS
फलकुसमुसपंदुिचता रोपणतो भवित केवलान् न यत: ।

“Trees do not produce fruits and flowers merely because they are planted.”
This line is from an ancient Indian text named Vrikshayurveda. It records 
useful observations about plant growth, soil, and agricultural practices to 
help improve crop health, growth and production. The knowledge in the 
text seems to be based on practical experiences and patterns seen over 
time. These ideas were then systematically documented to guide farming 
practices. For instance, there are references to different methods of organic 
manure preparation, such as mixing water, barley, and various seeds, like 
green, black, and horse grams.

10.2  How Do Plants Get Food for their 
Growth?

We know that animals get their food from plants, either directly by 
eating plants or indirectly by eating animals that in turn eat plants 
for their nutrition and growth. But how do plants obtain the food 
they need to grow? Unlike animals, plants do not eat food. 

10.2.1 Leaves: the ̒ food factories ̓ of plants
Plants store food in the form of starch, a type of carbohydrate. 
This starch is produced in the leaves of a plant which, by design, 
are generally broad and flat. These are mostly green because of 
the presence of a green pigment called chlorophyll, that helps in 
capturing sunlight efficiently.

Let us find out the role chlorophyll plays in the preparation of 
food in the form of starch in plants.

 Take out the leaf and place it on a plate. 
 Now, put a few drops of diluted iodine solution with the help 

of a dropper on the decolourised leaf (Fig. 10.2b). Wait for a 
few minutes and observe.

 If the colour of the leaf changes to blue-black, it indicates the 
presence of starch.

Caution — Alcohol should never be placed near a heat source directly, 
as it is highly flammable and can easily lead to fire and burns. 

Did you wonder why we decolourise the leaf in the DIVE
EEPER

beginning of this activity?
Decolourisation of a leaf enables us to easily observe 
colour change and, thus, the presence of starch.

In Activity 10.1, we have learnt that water and sunlight are 
essential for plant growth. In Activity 10.2, we have discovered 
that green leaves store starch as food. 

Bhaskar loves gardening during his free time. Being a curious 
student, he often looks around his garden and wonders how 
plants produce food. From his experiences, Bhaskar knows 
that water and sunlight are essential for plant growth. But he 
wonders if sunlight contributes to the production of food in the 
form of starch in plants.

How does sunlight 
contribute in the production 

of starch in plants? 

Activity 10.3: Let us check 

Bhaskar took a leaf having both green and non-green patches 
from each of two similar potted plants — one kept in sunlight and 
the other kept in the dark for 36 hours. He wanted to compare 
the leaves before and after the starch test. 

He made a sketch of the leaves to record the location of the 
green and the non-green patches on them with the help of a 
tracing paper. After that, he performed an iodine test (as shown 
in Activity 10.2) on the leaves. Bhaskar recorded his observations 
in Table 10.2.

In Table 10.2, Bhaskar recorded a blue-black colour (indicating 
the presence of starch) on the green patches of the leaf obtained 
from the plant placed in sunlight. Bhaskar also recorded that the 
leaf obtained from the plant kept in the dark does not show a 
blue-black colour, even on the green patches, indicating that no 
starch has been produced. Non-green patches of the leaf obtained 
from the plant placed in sunlight do not turn blue-black. Does it 
indicate that there is no chlorophyll present in those patches? 
The non-green patches may not have sufficient chlorophyll to 
prepare enough starch to be detected using the iodine test. 

FASCINATING FACTS
Some plant leaves appear red, violet, 
or brown because they contain more 
of these coloured pigments than the 
green-coloured chlorophyll. This hides 
the green colour. Some of these pigments 
also help in photosynthesis. You can use 
an iodine test to check for the presence 
of starch in these leaves, indicating that 
photosynthesis has indeed taken place.

143
What do we infer from the observations listed in Table 10.2? 

As we know, leaves are mostly green because of the presence 
of chlorophyll. We have also seen that the starch is produced 
where green patches of the leaf are present. We can infer that 
chlorophyll helps in preparing starch in the presence of sunlight. 
In fact, it is essential for the preparation of starch. Hence, the 
leaves are also called ‘food factories’ of plants. 

What else is essential for the preparation of food in plants? 
Let us find out. 

10.2.2 Role of air in the preparation of food

While reading contributions of 
scientists in plant nutrition, my sister 
told me that air plays a role in the 
process of food preparation in plants. 

Which gas from the air is 
essential in the process of 
food preparation in plants? 

Activity 10.4: Let us experiment 
(demonstration activity)

The teacher may demonstrate this activity.
 Take a potted green plant and keep it in the Destarched 

dark for two to three days to allow it to destarch plant

(i.e., lose any stored starch). Then, locate one 
leaf of this plant for this experiment. Sodium

 Take a wide-mouthed bottle and pour some solution

caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) into it 
(caustic soda absorbs carbon dioxide from 
the air). (a) The set-up

Caution — Caustic soda is a strong chemical that can 
cause skin burns; only teachers should handle it.
 Insert half of the destarched leaf into the 

bottle through a split cork, leaving the other 
half of the leaf outside, and place the bottle as (b) Iodine test on the leaf
shown in Fig. 10.3a.

chlorophyll and air

Life Processes in Plants



 Place the set-up in sunlight for a few hours.
 Observe and record the availability of water, sunlight, 

chlorophyll, and carbon dioxide in Table 10.3.
 Remove the leaf and test it for starch using the iodine test, as 

was done in Activity 10.2. 
 Record your observations in Table 10.3.

Availability of Starch 
Part of the 

leaf Water Sunlight Chlorophyll Carbon present 
dioxide (Yes/No)

Part of the 
leaf inside the 
bottle
Part of the leaf 
outside the 
bottle

We notice that the part of the leaf that was outside the bottle 
turns blue-black, indicating the presence of starch. However, the 
part of the leaf inside the bottle does not turn blue-black in colour, 
indicating that food is not made in that part of the leaf. This is 
because the caustic soda solution inside the flask absorbs the 
carbon dioxide present in the air. What does this experiment show?

This experiment shows that carbon dioxide present in the air 
is essential for plants to prepare starch. 

Based on Activities 10.3 and 10.4, what do you conclude? 
Which part of the plant is involved in the synthesis of starch?  

Based on our learnings so far, we have found that sunlight, 
water, chlorophyll and carbon dioxide are essential for the 
synthesis of food in plants. This process by which plants prepare 
food in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll is called 
photosynthesis. A leaf is the primary site for photosynthesis.  Do 
other green parts of the plant also perform photosynthesis? Yes, 
other parts of the plants which have chlorophyll also perform 
photosynthesis.

So far, we have learnt that plants take in carbon dioxide from 
the air and water, and use sunlight to prepare their food by the 
process of photosynthesis. But have you ever thought about what 
more happens during this process? Do plants only take in

substances from their surroundings, or do they also release 
something? Let us explore this through an experiment performed 
by Barkha didi.

A? The gas produced in this set-up 
caused bubbles to emerge and get

tube. Which gas is this?  of oxygen during photosynthesis

Oh yes! I remember. In our science lab,  I 
have seen a similar set-up placed under 
sunlight near a window. 

When sufficient gas was accumulated in the 
inverted test tube, Barkha didi placed her 
thumb on the mouth of the test tube while 
taking the test tube off the set-up. She then 
quickly inserted a lit matchstick into the tube 
and the matchstick produced an intense flame. 

She inferred that the gas in the test tube is rich in 
oxygen. It indicates that oxygen is released during 
the process of photosynthesis. It also indicates that 
photosynthesis occurs in the presence of sunlight.

Based on Barkha didi’s experiment, we can conclude that 
oxygen is released during photosynthesis.

KNOW A SCIENTIST
Many scientists across the world contributed to develop an 
understanding of photosynthesis. In India, Rustom Hormusji Dastur 

(1896–1961) studied the process of photosynthesis. 
He was a plant scientist and served as the head of the 
Botany Department at the Royal Institute of Science, 
Bombay (now the Institute of Science, Mumbai), from 
1921–1935. He studied effects of the amount of water 
and temperature on photosynthesis. He examined the 
importance of water, temperature, and the colour of 
light in the process of photosynthesis. 

10.2.4 How do leaves exchange gases during 
photosynthesis?
We now know that photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide, and 
oxygen is released in the process. Which part of the plant helps in 
the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen? Let us conduct an 
activity to understand where the exchange of gases takes place.

Stomata

 Collect a leaf from a plant such as rhoeo, 
money plant, onion, hibiscus, coleus, or 
any grass.

 Put it in a beaker filled with water.
 Carefully peel a thin layer from the lower 

surface of the leaf.
 Place the peel in a watch glass with water.
 Now, take a microscope slide and 

carefully put a drop of water on it.
 Using forceps, transfer the peel of the leaf 

from the watch glass to the slide with the 
help of forceps.

 Put a drop of ink on the leaf peel with the 0.1 mm
help of a dropper. Fig. 10.6: Stomata on the lower 

 Cover the peel with a coverslip and surface of a rhoeo leaf
observe it under a microscope.

What do you observe? Do you notice tiny 
pores on the peel, as shown in Fig. 10.6? 
These pores are called stomata. Stomata, present on the surface 
of leaves, help in the exchange of gases.

10.3 Transport in Plants 
10.3.1 Transport of water and minerals

All living beings need water to grow. Plants use water in the 
process of photosynthesis. Water, along with minerals present in 
the soil, is taken up by the roots of a plant. Minerals are important 
nutrients for the growth of plants. How do water and minerals 
taken up by the roots move to all parts of the plant? 

We can study water transport in plants by carrying out an 
activity. For this activity, we require two glass tumblers, some 
water, red ink, and twigs of two similar tender plants, preferably 
with white-coloured flowers (for example, white sadabahar, 
balsam), as shown in Fig. 10.7.

Activity 10.7: Let us experiment

 Take two tumblers and label them A and B. 
 Fill one-third of each tumbler with water.
 Add a few drops of red ink to tumbler B.
 Obliquely cut the stems of both plants at their 

base while keeping them inside the water and 
immediately place one plant in each tumbler, 
as shown in Fig. 10.7a and Fig. 10.7b.

 Observe these plants the next day.
A B What do you notice? Compare the plant 

(a) With water (b) With coloured water stems placed in the tumblers. Do you observe 
plant twigs placed in water with different 

treatments red colour in the stem, leaves, and flowers of the 
plant from Tumbler B? Fig. 10.7c and Fig. 10.7d 
show the plants after one day. Compare the plant 
in Fig. 10.7c with that in Fig. 10.7d. A red colour 
is visible in the stem, leaves, and flowers of the 
plant in Fig. 10.7d. How did different parts of the 
plant acquire this red colour? 

Cut the stem from the upper part of the plant 
A B that is not immersed in the red-coloured water. 

(c) With water (d) With coloured water Observe the cut stem using a magnifying glass.  Do 
plant twigs after one day you spot the red colour in the stem (Fig. 10.7e)? 

How does the red colour ink move upwards? This 
Phloem is due to the thin tube-like structure called the 

Xylem xylem present in the stem, branches, and leaves 
Cut of plants. Just like red ink, minerals dissolved in 

water also move up the stem through the xylem. 
Now, we know that water and minerals are 

(e) Enlarged view of cut end of the twig transported to the leaves and other parts of

water transportation in plants plants through the xylem (Fig. 10.8). The water 
transported through the xylem is used to perform 

Food transport various functions. How does food get transported 
through phloem to other parts of a plant? 

10.3.2 Transport of food
Water transport We know that leaves are the primary site for 
through xylem photosynthesis. The food prepared by plants in the 

leaves is transported to all parts of the plant. This 
food is transported through another set of thin 
tube-like structures called the phloem (Fig. 10.8). 

Fig. 10.8: Transport of water The transported food may also be stored in some 
and minerals in a plant other parts of a plant, such as seeds and roots.

10.4 Do Plants Respire? 
In the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, chapter ‘Living 
Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’, you learnt that all 
living beings respire. Do plants also respire like we do?

Activity 10.8: Let us find out

 Soak some moong bean seeds in water overnight.
 Put a layer of cotton in a conical flask (Fig. 10.9) and moisten 

the cotton with water to keep it wet. 
 Place the soaked seeds over the wet cotton in the conical flask. 
 Cover the mouth of the conical flask with 

a cork having two holes. 
 Fit two tubes A and B through the two Tube A Lime water

holes on the cork, as shown in Fig. 10.9. 
 Leave it undisturbed for 24 hours in 

the dark. Tube B
 Take two test tubes and fill them with Germinating 

lime water. seeds 
 Cover the mouth of one test tube with a 

cork having one hole in it.
 Dip one glass tube in the test tube Fig. 10.9: Set-up to test respiration in plants

through a hole in the cork.
 Connect the flask and test tube with a rubber pipe as shown 

in Fig. 10.9.
Compare both the test tubes for any change in colour. Does 

the lime water turn milky in both the test tubes? Why does the 
lime water turn milky in the test tube connected to the flask? 
Lime water turns milky due to the presence of more carbon 
dioxide in the flask. But where does this carbon dioxide come 
from? As we know, carbon dioxide is naturally present in very 
small quantities in the air. In the flask, additional carbon dioxide 
is produced by the seeds as they respire. 

During respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of 
oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and energy. The word 
equation for the proccess of respiration, is as follows — 

Glucose + Oxygen    Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy
The energy produced during respiration is used by plants 

for their growth and development. All parts of a plant, green or 
non-green, carry out respiration.

Thus, plants have different mechanisms for synthesising, 
transporting, and utilising food to get energy.

Life Processes in Plants



In a Nutshell

 All living organisms require food that provide energy for 
their growth and development.

 Plants use carbon dioxide and water in the presence of 
sunlight and chlorophyll to produce glucose and oxygen. 
This process of synthesis of food is known as photosynthesis.

 Leaves are the ̒ food factories ̓ of a plant. 
 Tiny pores on the surface of leaves, called stomata, help 

in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide during 
photosynthesis and respiration.

 The xylem transports water and minerals from roots, while 
the phloem carries food from leaves to all parts of the plants.

 Plants break down glucose and release energy by a process 
called respiration. They use oxygen and release carbon 
dioxide in this process.

KNOW A SCIENTIST
Kamala Sohonie (1911–1998) was a woman scientist of India. She 
received a Ph.D. degree for her remarkable contribution in the area of 

respiration in plants from Cambridge University. 
She returned to India and worked at the Lady 
Hardinge Medical College in New Delhi, and later 
at the Nutrition Research Laboratory, Coonoor. 
Thereafter, she moved to the then Royal Institute 
of Science, Bombay, where she was eventually 
appointed as Director. Much of her work helped 
improve the nutritive values of plant foods. She 
also worked on the sap of the coconut palm as a 
nutritive drink called Neera.

11 Light: Shadows and 
Reflections 

In the Western Ghat region of Maharashtra, Keshav spends 
part of his summer vacation at his friend Jatin’s grandparents’ 
village. Having lived in a big city, he finds the forests, fresh 
air, sounds of gushing streams, and chirping birds a novel 
experience.

However, for Keshav, the most fascinating sight is the 
dance of hundreds of fireflies at night, flashing their lights 
in a wonderful performance. Jatin’s grandparents explain 
that fireflies are seasonal insects and they use light to 
communicate. Unfortunately, Keshav also learns the number 
of fireflies is decreasing due to light pollution, reduced forest 
cover, and excessive tourism.

At the end of their vacation, Keshav and Jatin board an 
evening bus back to their city. As the bus winds through the 
hilly roads, Keshav watches the moonlit landscape and the 
beams from the headlights of passing vehicles flashing by. He 
is reminded of the many poems and songs about moonlight, 
and wonders — does the Moon actually produce its own 
light? Did we not learn in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the 
Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity that all other objects in 
our solar system shine only by reflecting the light of the 
Sun? Is moonlight just reflected sunlight? Which objects give 
off their own light? While thinking, he notices something 
strange — light seems to move in a straight line!

Chapter 11.indd   153 4/3/2025   4:56:22 PM



11.1 Sources of Light
The Sun gives out or emits its own light and is the main source 
of natural light on the Earth. Stars, lightning, natural fire, and 
certain animals also emit their own light (Fig. 11.1).

In ancient times, humans learnt to create 
fire — the earliest form of artificial lighting. With 
time, they learnt to create 
fire using different fuels, 
such as animal fat, oil, 
wax, and gas (Fig. 11.2). 

With the invention of 
electricity and different 
kinds of electric light 
sources, most of the 
lighting needs of humans 
are now met by electric 

Fig. 11.1: Some natural sources of light lighting (Fig. 11.3).
Objects that emit their own light are 

called luminous objects. Objects that 
do not emit their own light are called 
non-luminous objects. The Moon is a 
non-luminous object. It does not emit its 
own light. It just reflects the light emitted 
by the Sun that falls on it. Fig. 11.2: Fire as a source 

of artificial light

Fig. 11.3: Some sources of electric light

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamps are modern light 
sources that consume much less power, are brighter 
and last longer than traditional lamps. This not 
only reduces electricity bills but is also better for 
environment. Recognising their advantages, the 
Indian government has made substantial efforts to 
promote the use of LED lamps nationwide. At their 
end of life, LED lamps must be appropriately disposed 
or recycled, and not thrown in the garbage.

11.2 Does Light Travel in a Straight Line?
Let us do an activity to try to find out.

Screen
Activity 11.1: Let us investigate Hole

 Take three matchboxes and make a hole in 
the inner tray of each matchbox, exactly at the 
same position.

 Arrange these three matchboxes in a straight 
line. Make sure that all three holes are exactly 
at the same height and are in a line as shown Fig. 11.4: Matchbox activity—
in Fig. 11.4. light through holes

 Place a torch light on one side of the matchboxes, ensuring 
that its lamp is at the height of the holes.

 Place a cardboard (screen) on the other side of the matchboxes 
and obtain a bright spot on it. (You may need to slightly adjust 
the heights of boxes.)

 Move one of the matchboxes slightly to a side or up and down. 
Are you able to obtain the light spot on the screen now?

When all the three holes are not in the same line, we could not 
obtain the light spot on the screen. These observations suggest 
that light travels in a straight line.

Can we somehow 
check it in some I have an idea. Let us try 

other way? to see the candle flame 
through a bent pipe! 

Should we also try out this idea? 
Activity 11.2: Let us explore

Caution — Use a lighted candle under adult supervision 
only.
 Take a long hollow pipe of some flexible (a)

material and align it so that you can see the 
candle flame as shown in Fig. 11.5a.

 Now, bend the pipe and try to see the candle 
flame again (Fig. 11.5b). Can you still see it? 

You could see the candle flame through a straight 
pipe but not through a bent pipe. This shows that 
light travels in a straight line. (b)

anyone’s eyes, as it can cause serious eye damage.

Pass a laser beam 
through a beaker filled with 
water in which a drop of 
milk is added to make the 
laser beam easily visible. 
What do you observe? Do you see that the 
beam of laser light inside water follows a 
straight path? 

However, light can sometimes even bend 
around corners! This is something you will 
learn in the higher grades.

Translucent, and Opaque Materials

 List the materials of the objects in Table 11.1 and classify them 

into transparent, translucent, and opaque (In the chapter 
‘Materials Around Us’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity
you learnt to classify materials into transparent, 
translucent, and opaque, depending on how 
you could see through them).

 Go to a dark room, turn on the torch, and place 
it at such a position that you get a spot of light 
from the torch on a wall. Or you may place a 
cardboard screen as shown in Fig. 11.6 and get 
the spot of light on it. Fig. 11.6: Passing light 

 We will now conduct this activity in two through different materials
parts — prediction and observation.
 Predict what will happen if you hold an object in front of 

the light coming out of the torch. Would you continue to 
see the spot of light on the screen? Note your prediction 
in Table 11.1.

 Now, actually place the object between the torch and 
the screen. Does light pass through the object? Note your 
observation in Table 11.1.

 Repeat this for all the objects.
Was your observation the same as your prediction? What 

conclusions could you draw? Light passes almost completely 
through transparent materials. Light passes partially through 
translucent materials. Light does not pass through opaque
materials.

What happens when an 
opaque object blocks 

the path of light?

11.4 Shadow Formation
What did you see on the screen in Activity 11.3 when 
an opaque object was placed in the path of light? Did 
you see a dark patch on the wall? Why was this dark 
patch formed? 

We now know that light travels in a straight line. 
So, when an opaque object is placed in its path, light is 
blocked. The dark patch, where light does not reach, 
is the shadow. 

Fig. 11.7: Shadows around us

Chapter 11.indd   157 4/3/2025   4:56:31 PM

Light: Shadows and Reflections 



We have noticed shadows of ourselves and other objects 
around us when we are in the Sun or under a light (Fig. 11.7). 
Also, you might have had fun making different shapes with 
shadows sometime.  

Do translucent and transparent objects create shadows or not? 
Did you notice that in Activity 11.3? Opaque objects form darker 
shadows. Translucent objects make lighter shadows. Even some 
transparent objects can create faint shadows!
Let us learn more about shadows.

Activity 11.4: Let us explore

 Collect some opaque objects of different shapes and sizes. 
 Repeat Activity 11.3, but this time, carry out the actions 

mentioned in the first column of Table 11.2.
 Observe the shape and size of the shadow on the screen for 

each of the actions. 
Did the shadow form in all cases? Was the shape and size of the 
shadow the same as the object?
 Record your observations in the second column of Table 11.2.
Table 11.2: Observation of shadows

Action shadow

The object is removed.

The torch is switched off.

The object is moved closer to the torch, 
keeping the torch and the screen fixed.

The object is tilted, keeping the torch and 
the screen fixed.

The colour of the object is changed.
What conclusions do you draw from this activity? What do 

we need to observe a shadow? Does the colour of the shadow 
change when the colour of the object is changed?

Shadows are formed when an object blocks light from falling on 
a screen. We need a source of light, an opaque object, and a screen 

158

Chapter 11.indd   158 4/3/2025   4:56:31 PM

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7



159
to observe a shadow. The walls, floor, ground, or any other surface 
acts as a screen for observing shadows in our daily life.
The shape, size, and sharpness of the shadow depend on the 
position of the object relative to the light source and the screen. 
The shadows may give information about the object or we may 
not be able to guess the object at all. Changing the colour of 
opaque objects does not change the colour of the shadows.

FASCINATING FACTS
Shadow play, or shadow puppetry, 
has been a part of our cultural 
heritage for centuries. In this art 
form, flat cut-out figures called 
shadow puppets are placed between 
a light source and a screen. By 
moving the puppets and the light, 
puppeteers can create life-like 
movements, bringing the characters 
to life. Different regions have their 
own unique styles, like the Charma 
Bahuli Natya in Maharashtra, Keelu 
Bomme and Tholu Bommalata of Andhra Pradesh, Togalu Gombeyaata
in Karnataka, Ravana Chhaya in Odisha, Tholpavakoothu in Kerala, and 
Bommalattam in Tamil Nadu. These are used not only for entertainment 
but also communicate important messages to the community.

11.5 Reflection of Light

When the opaque object was a shiny object like a 
polished steel plate, I got a shadow on the screen, 
but I also saw that there was a bright spot of light 
on the wall on the opposite side. Why was it so?

Activity 11.5: Let us investigate

 Find a shiny flat steel plate or a plane mirror, that is, a mirror 
that is flat and not curved. 

 Take it outside and let the sunlight fall on the shiny surface. 
What can you do to redirect light on the wall on which the 
sunlight is not falling directly?

Chapter 11.indd   159 4/3/2025   4:56:32 PM

Light: Shadows and Reflections 



 Turn the shiny plate or mirror in 
different directions to redirect the 
light onto a wall or a nearby surface 
(Fig. 11.8). Do you see a spot of light 
on the wall? Does it mean that the 
shiny plate or mirror has changed 
the direction of light?

 Now, tilt the shiny plate or mirror 
in different ways and observe 
the light spot on the wall. Does it 
change position? Notice how light 
always travels in straight lines and 

Fig. 11.8: Using mirror to redirect changes direction when it falls on 
sunlight on a wall the shiny plate or mirror.

What conclusion do you draw from your observations? This 
activity suggests that a shiny surface or a mirror changes the 
direction of light that falls upon it. This change in direction of 
light by a mirror is called the reflection of light. Let us try to 
understand the reflection of light by a mirror.

Activity 11.6: Let us experiment

Thin slit  Take a plane mirror with stand, a torch, a comb, 
a sheet of white paper, and a strip of black paper.

 Using the black paper, close all openings of the 
comb, except for one to make a thin slit. 

 Spread a white paper on a table, hold the comb 
perpendicular to the sheet of paper and shine 
the torch light on the slit. Adjust the comb and 
torch slightly till you see a thin beam of light 
along the paper which has passed through the 

(a) slit (Fig. 11.9a).
Plane mirror  Now, place the mirror in the path of the light 

beam while keeping the comb steady (Fig. 11.9b). 
What do you observe?

The path of the light beam is changed after falling 
on the mirror. The reflection of light occurs at the 
mirror.

In a mirror, I can also see my 
(b) face. Is that also due to the 

Fig. 11.9: (a) A light beam (b) Reflection reflection of light?

11.6 Images Formed in a Plane Mirror
Look into the mirror. Do you see your face in it? What you see is 
a reflection of your face in the mirror. We also see reflections of 
other objects that are in front of the mirror. Let us try to find out 
more about this.

Activity 11.7: Let us experiment

 Take a plane mirror and a pen or some other object.
 Place the pen in front of the mirror as shown in 

Fig. 11.10.
What do you see in the mirror? It appears as if a similar 
pen is placed behind the mirror. The pen which appears 
behind the mirror is the image of the pen formed by the Fig. 11.10: Image of a pen 

in a plane mirror
mirror. The pen itself is the object.
 Now, move the pen to different positions in front of the 

mirror and compare the sizes of the images of the pen at 
each position. 

Are the two sizes the same? The image formed by a plane 
mirror is of the same size as the object.
 Again, move the pen to different positions in front of the 

mirror and observe if the image is upright at each position. 
Does the tip of the pen appear on top at each position? An 

upright image is called erect. An image formed by a plane mirror 
is erect.
 Now, place a screen vertically behind the mirror. Move it 

around. Do you get the image on the screen? Repeat this by 
placing the screen in front of the mirror.

The image formed by a plane mirror cannot be obtained on 
a screen.

Activity 11.8: Let us experiment

 Stand in front of a plane mirror and look at your image 
(Fig. 11.11). Notice how far it appears to be from the mirror.

 Now, stand close to the mirror. Is the image also closer to the 
mirror?

 Stand at different distances from the mirror and notice how 
far the image appears to be from the mirror in each case. 
Do you find any relation between your distance from the Fig. 11.11: Observing one’s 
mirror and the distance of your image from the mirror? own image in a mirror

Chapter 11.indd   161 4/3/2025   4:56:34 PM

Light: Shadows and Reflections 



You might have noticed that when you stand close to the 
plane mirror, the image also appears to be close to the mirror. 
The image appears to be far from the mirror when you stand far 
from the plane mirror.
 Raise your left arm. Which arm does your image raise?
 Touch your right ear. Which ear does your image touch?

You find that your left appears right in your image and your 
right appears left in your image. This type of perceived left-right 
reversal is called lateral inversion. There is lateral inversion in 
the images formed by a plane mirror.

Oh! Now I realise why ‘ ̓ is written 
on an ambulance. It reads ‘AMBULANCE ̓ when 

viewed from the rear-view mirrors of the 
vehicle ahead of the ambulance.

FASCINATING FACTS
When mirrors were invented is not known. Earlier, mirrors 
were made by polishing stone or metal. When glass mirrors 
started being made, the art of making metal mirrors got lost 
gradually. However, it still survives, for example, in Kerala, 
where Aranmula Kannadi, a unique metal surface mirror has 
been made for centuries.

Can we see an image of an 
object only in a mirror or are 

there some other ways as well?

11.7 Pinhole Camera
A pinhole camera is a device in which the light rays from an 
object pass through a tiny hole (a pinhole) and form an image on 
a screen.

EEPER A pinhole camera gives an upside down image. On the other hand, 

there is lateral inversion in the image formed by a mirror but it is 
not upside down. We will learn more about this in higher grades.

11.8 Making Some Useful Items
After having learnt that light travels in a straight line and is 
reflected by mirrors, it is time to create some useful items based 
on this learning.

11.8.1 Periscope
Mirror 1 We can make a simple periscope by 

placing two plane mirrors in a Z-shaped 
box as shown in Fig. 11.14.

Reflection from two mirrors 
enables us to see objects that are not 

Mirror 2 visible directly. Periscopes are used in 
submarines, tanks, or by soldiers to see 
outside their bunkers. You may use it 
to look ahead when standing behind 
taller friends.

11.8.2 Kaleidoscope
Fig. 11.14: A periscope Get three rectangular plane mirror 

strips of equal width and join them 
together in a triangular manner as 
shown in Fig. 11.15a. You may use three 
strips of thick reflective paper instead 
of mirrors. Fix these in a circular tube 
of thick chart paper (Fig. 11.15b). On 
one end of the tube, fix a transparent 

(a) (b) plastic sheet using a rubber band or 
an adhesive tape. Place several broken 
pieces of coloured bangles or beads on 
this (Fig. 11.15c), and cover it with a 
tracing paper using a rubber band or 
an adhesive tape. 

When you peep through the open 
side, you view a beautiful pattern 

(c) (d)

sides of the kaleidoscope open and

165
point it towards a tree or other objects, you see beautiful patterns. 
An interesting feature of the kaleidoscope is that one always gets 
to see a different pattern every time the kaleidoscope is turned 
about. Since there are 3 mirrors, and multiple images (due to 
reflections of reflections), many interesting patterns are formed. 
Designers and artists often use kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new 
patterns.

In a Nutshell

 Objects that emit their own light are called luminous objects.
 Light travels in a straight line.
 Light passes almost completely through transparent 

materials. Light passes partially through translucent 
materials. Light does not pass through opaque materials.

 A shadow is formed when light is blocked by an object. 
Opaque objects form darker shadows. Translucent objects 
make lighter shadows. Some transparent objects can create 
faint shadows.

 The change in the direction of light by a mirror is called 
reflection of light.

 The image formed by a plane mirror is of the same size as 
the object, is erect, cannot be obtained on a screen, and is 
laterally inverted.

 A pinhole camera creates an inverted image of an object on 
a screen. ENQUIRY

Earth, Moon, and 
12 the Sun

One morning in Kanniyakumari, Tamil Nadu, 12-year-old 
Rashmika was eagerly cycling to school. She was excited. That was 
the day her science teacher had dedicated a class for students to 
share and try to explain interesting observations.

Rashmika had been noticing that the coconut tree shadows 
were long in the morning but shorter in the afternoon on her 
way back. She thought about it and decided that the size of the 
shadows changed because the Sun moved across the sky during 
the day. But she also remembered learning that the Earth moved 
around the Sun (in chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science 
textbook Curiosity) so she was puzzled. She wondered — does the 
Sun move in the sky? Or does the Earth move?

Chapter 12.indd  


12.1 Rotation of the Earth
You might have also noticed that the Sun rises in the East and sets in 
the West. Have you ever wondered why? Let us try to understand 
why. Have you ever enjoyed riding a merry-go-round at a park or 
at your school? Let us go back to riding a merry-go-round!

Activity 12.1: Let us explore

 Sit on a merry-go-round facing towards the outer side as 
shown in Fig. 12.1.

 Ask someone to turn the merry-go-
round slowly in the anti-clockwise 
direction as shown in Fig. 12.1. While 
you are sitting on the moving merry-
go-round, look around you. Do the 
objects around you appear to be 
moving? In which direction do they 
appear to be moving? 

While you turn in the anti-clockwise 
direction, the objects appear to turn 
around you in the opposite direction, that 
is, in the clockwise direction.
 Now fix your gaze at a particular tree 

(or a building) ahead of you while 
Fig. 12.1: A girl observing objects around sitting on the merry- go-round turning 

her while riding a merry-go-round around in anti-clockwise direction.
In which direction do you find the tree turning around you? Is 

it in your view all the time?
The tree appears to turn around you in the opposite direction, 

that is, the clockwise direction. The tree appears in your view 
from your left-hand side and then moves out of your view on the 
right-hand side when you view it from a merry-go-round turning 
around in anti-clockwise direction.

Using the observations made by us while riding a merry-go-
round, let us now think. When we view from the Earth, the Sun 
appears in the East, moves across the sky from the East to the West 
and disappears in the West. Does it indicate that the Sun is moving 
in the sky? Or might it be that the Earth itself is turning around 
and the Sun just appears to move?

The fact is that the Sun appears to be moving because we view 
it from the Earth, which is turning around itself.

In which way is the Earth turning around itself? To visualise 

this, let us recall some of the objects which turn around themselves. 
Have you watched a top spinning around its spindle (Fig. 12.2a)? 
Or a spinning fan (Fig. 12.2b)? Or tried spinning a ball (Fig. 12.2c)?

the Earth and identified North Pole, South Pole, and 
Equator on it. You also learnt that its axis passed South Pole
through its North and South poles (in the Grade 6 Social (SP)

Science textbook Exploring Society India and Beyond). Fig. 12.3: Rotation of the Earth

Activity 12.2: Let us explore

 Use a globe to represent the Earth and place a small 
sticker to mark your location on it (Fig. 12.4a). 

 While viewing from above the North Pole, slowly 
rotate the globe on its axis in anti-clockwise Sticker

 Observe how your location turns around 
and finally comes back to its original position

The light falls on the eastern part of India first when the globe 
rotates from West to East with respect to the North-South axis of 
the globe. 
 Now while rotating the globe from West to East, observe your 

location on the Earth. Does it go through a cycle of day and 
night?

Sunrise occurs as your location moves into light and sunset 
occurs as it moves into darkness.

The Earth’s rotation from West to East causes the day-night 
cycle. As shown in Fig. 12.5, the side facing the Sun experiences 
daytime, while the other side is dark and experiences night.

Due to the rotation of the Earth, the Sun appears to rise in the 
eastward direction, move across the sky from the East to the West 
and set in the westward direction (Fig. 12.6). Then the night begins 
and the stars become visible in the sky.

FASCINATING FACTS
In an earlier chapter ‘Measurement of Time and 
Motion’, you learnt how the scientist Galileo 
discovered an important property of a pendulum, 
and in the seventeenth century, another scientist, 
Huygens, used that property to make pendulum 
clocks that measured time. In the middle of 
nineteenth century, another scientist, Leon 
Foucault, used a long pendulum to give the first 
simple demonstration of the Earth’s rotation. The 
pendulum, known as a Foucault pendulum in his 
honour, consists of a long string with a heavy bob, 
suspended from a high ceiling.

A Foucault pendulum with a length of 22 metres 
has been hung from a skylight in the Constitution 
Hall of the new Parliament building in New Delhi, 
India. It symbolises the integration of the idea of 
India with the vastness of the cosmos.

 After two hours, observe the Big Dipper again. Has it moved? 

Again, draw its orientation and note down the time.
 Repeat the above step after two hours. Do you observe that 

the Big Dipper appears to move around the Pole Star (notice 
just the movement even if you cannot see the Pole Star)? 

The Earth’s axis of rotation points very close to the Pole Star in 
the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the Pole Star appears nearly 
stationary in the sky from the Earth. All the stars appear to move 
around it. Just like the Sun, the Moon also appears to rise in the 
eastward direction and set in the westward direction because the 
Earth rotates from West to East.

FASCINATING FACTS
Astrophotographers take long exposure

FASCINATING FACTS
Ancient Indian astronomers, including Aryabhata, had also 
noticed the daily apparent motion of the celestial objects, such 
as the Sun, Moon, planets and stars. Aryabhata was a famous 
mathematician and astronomer of ancient India who wrote an 
important treatise, Aryabhatiya, around the fifth century CE. The 
apparent motion of the stars due to the rotation of the Earth is 
explained in Verse 9, Golapada, Aryabhatiya.

¥¿ÜæçÙ ÖæçÙ ÌmÌ÷ï â×Âçp×»æçÙ ÜVæØæ×÷ïH
Just as a man in a boat moving forward sees stationary objects as 
moving backwards, so also the stars that are stationary are seen 
by people of Lanka as moving towards the west.
Aryabhata’s stated value for the time taken by the Earth to 
complete one full rotation about its axis is around 23 hours 56 
minutes 4.1 seconds (in modern units). This value is impressively 
close to the currently accepted value.

I have seen that the stars and 
constellations that appear in the 
East at sunset change during 
different months.

Yes. Maybe that is why we were told to 
look for certain stars and constellations at 
certain times of the year in Grade 6. But, 
why do different stars appear in the night 
sky over the course of a year?

12.2 Revolution of the Earth
While rotating on its own axis, the Earth also revolves around the Sun 
as we learnt in Grade 6. This movement is different from rotation. 
Revolution is the motion of an object around another object. 

Chapter 12.indd   175 4/3/2025   4:57:18 PM

Earth, Moon, and the Sun



The path an object takes while revolving around another object 
is called its orbit. If viewed from the top (Fig. 12.8), the orbit of the 
Earth around the Sun is nearly circular. (In the figure of the Solar 
System given in chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science 
textbook Curiosity, the orbit appeared elongated because it was 
a side view of the orbit). The Earth completes one revolution
around the Sun in about 365 days and 6 hours.

12.2.1 Changing view of night sky from the Earth
Every evening the Sun sets in the westward direction and the night 
sky becomes visible. We know that this occurs due to the Earth’s 
rotation. As the Earth also revolves around the Sun continuously, 
the stars seen in the night sky after sunset gradually change over 
a year as we look in different directions, as shown in Fig. 12.8.

You can also notice this change by looking at the pattern of 
stars (such as those that you learnt about in Grade 6), at a fixed 
time of the night, on days separated by a month.

in western India, who used the appearance of certain patterns of stars

12.2.2 Seasons on the Earth

I have noticed that we go 
through a cycle of seasons 
every year. Is it related to I have also noticed 
the revolution of the Earth that days are longer 
around the Sun in some in summer than in 
way? winter.

The Earth’s axis of rotation is not upright with respect to the 
orbit, but is tilted. The Earth maintains this tilt as it orbits around 
the Sun (Fig. 12.9). The tilt of the Earth’s axis and the spherical 
shape of the Earth gives rise to seasons. Let us find out, how.

Fig. 12.9: Different positions of the Earth while revolving around the Sun

top view. The sizes and distances are not to scale)

In June, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun while 
the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun (Fig. 12.9). 
As seen in Fig. 12.10a, a given amount of sunrays are spread in 
a smaller area in the Northern Hemisphere as compared to the 
Southern Hemisphere due to the spherical shape of the Earth’s 
surface. So that area is heated more.

Further, the Northern Hemisphere receives sunlight for more 
than 12 hours in June (Fig. 12.11a). So, the Northern Hemisphere 
experiences more intense sunlight, which lasts for a longer time, 
causing the summer season. In December, the situation is opposite 
in the Northern Hemisphere and it experiences winter season 
with sunlight for shorter time (Fig. 12.10b and Fig. 12.11b).

There, it is winter in June and summer in December (Fig. 12.10 
and Fig. 12.11). 

Two incorrect reasons often given to explain why seasons occur 
DIVE

EEPER on the Earth are:
 When the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the Sun, it is 

closer to the Sun.
 The orbit of the Earth is an oval with the Sun slightly displaced 

from its centre so the Earth is at different distances from the 
Sun over the year.

However, the difference in distances in either of these cases is 
very small and these are not the reasons why seasons occur on 
the Earth. In fact, the Earth is closest to the Sun in January.

In the Northern Hemisphere, the longest day occurs around 
21 June—this is known as summer solstice. After the summer 
solstice, the duration of a day becomes shorter while that of a DIVE

EEPER
night becomes longer. The shortest day and longest night in this 
Hemisphere occur around 22 December known as the winter 
solstice. Around 21 March and 23 September, the daytime lasts 
for 12 hours. In the Northern Hemisphere, these days are called 
the spring and the autumn equinox, respectively.

FASCINATING FACTS
At the North Pole, the Sun rises in the East direction on the equinox 
day — 21 March, and remains continuously in the sky for six months. 
The Sun sets on 22 September. The South Pole experiences the opposite 
behaviour. The polar regions thus experience continuous sunshine for 
six months followed by a six-month period of darkness.

On the equator, there is always 12 hours of sunlight and 12 
hours of darkness. There is little difference in the intensity of the 
sunrays falling on the equator in different months. Thus, for the 
southern states of India that lie close to the equator, the effect 
of seasons is not very prominent. Other effects, such as local 
geographical features and proximity to oceans or seas, can also 
influence these broader patterns seen in the two hemispheres, as 
you have learnt in social science. 

12.3 Eclipses

Day and night cycle, seasons, the life 
on the Earth... so much is dependent 
upon the Sun. Could the light from the 
Sun get blocked by the two planets
which are revolving between the 
Earth and the Sun?

The planets Mercury and Venus appear very small compared to 
the Sun, and never block the entire light from the Sun reaching 
us. However, you may be surprised to know that the Moon can 
do that. Do you remember studying in Grade 6 that the Moon is a 
natural satellite of the Earth and it revolves around the Earth as 
the Earth revolves around the Sun? 

Chapter 12.indd   179 4/3/2025   4:57:23 PM

Earth, Moon, and the Sun



12.3.1 Solar eclipse
At certain times, the Moon can come in between the Sun and the 
Earth in a way that obstructs the light from the Sun from reaching 
us. This is known as a solar eclipse. You may wonder how the 
Moon, which is smaller than the Sun, blocks the light coming from 
the Sun that we see in the sky. 

Activity 12.4: Let us explore

 Ask your friend to stand in front of you at a distance of about 
5 metres. Consider his head to be the Sun.

 Now close one eye and show a thumbs up with your 
outstretched hand towards your friend as shown in Fig. 12.12. 
Are you able to cover the entire head of your friend with your 
thumb?

You can cover the entire head of your friend 
with the help of your thumb, even though your 
thumb is much smaller than the actual size of 
your friend’s head. How could it be? The size of 
any object as seen by your eye — also known as 
apparent size — depends upon both its actual 
physical size and its distance from you. The 
thumb being much closer to you as compared to 
your friend, the apparent sizes of your thumb and 

Fig. 12.12: Trying to cover a your friend’s head as seen by you in Activity 12.4 
friend’s head with the thumb are similar.

The apparent sizes of the Moon and the Sun in the sky are 
similar when viewed from the Earth. This is so because though 
the Moon is much smaller in physical size than the Sun, the Moon 
is much closer to us compared to the Sun. Therefore, the Moon 
can appear to cover the entire Sun as viewed from the Earth.

DIVE Though the planets Mercury and Venus are much larger than 
EEPER the Moon in size, they are also much farther from the Earth as 

compared to the Moon. Thus, their apparent sizes are very much 
smaller than the Sun and they cannot block the Sun. For example, 
when Venus passes between the Sun and the Earth, it appears as 
a tiny black dot passing against the bright face of the Sun. This 
event, known as a Transit of Venus, is a rare event.

Figure 12.13 shows the arrangement of the Sun, the Moon, and 
the Earth during a solar eclipse. The shadow of the Moon falls on 
a small area on the surface of the Earth as seen in Fig. 12.13. This 
area is in total darkness, and no part of the Sun can be seen from 
there. The observers in this area witness a total solar eclipse 
(Fig. 12.14a).

(The sizes and distances are not to scale)

In areas where the Moon partially blocks out only some 
regions of the Sun, the observers see a partial solar eclipse 
(Fig. 12.13 and Fig. 12.14b). 

During a total solar eclipse, for a few minutes it turns dark 
during the day as no sunlight reaches the Earth. Due to the 
Earth’s rotation and the motion of the Moon in its orbit, the 
Moon’s shadow moves across the surface of the Earth. Thus, the 
total solar eclipse is visible only for a few minutes. As the Moon 
begins to move away from the front of the Sun (Fig. 12.14c), we (a) Total solar eclipse

Safe Viewing of a Solar Eclipse
Caution— During a solar eclipse, one might be tempted to look at the 
Sun, thinking that it wouldn’t be strong enough to cause harm to our 
eyes. However, even during the eclipse, the Sun is intense enough to 
damage the eyes and cause blindness. Thus, directly viewing solar (b) Partial solar eclipse

This activity, similar to Activity 11.5, is to be set up by your 
teacher. A mirror can be used to project an image of the 
Sun onto a wall. However, holding it at the correct angle DIVE

EEPER
throughout a solar eclipse can be difficult. To solve this, make 
a movable stand for the mirror. Use a hollow ball with a small 
hole, half-fill it with sand (to keep it stable), and attach a small 
mirror (such as an embroidery mirror) to it. Place the ball on 
a circular ring, like an adhesive tape ring, so it can be turned 
around easily. Adjust it until the Sun’s image appears on a 
wall or screen. Fig.  12.15 shows this set-up where the mirror 
is fixed to a green ball.
Caution — This activity should be performed strictly under 
supervision of a teacher. Take care not to direct the reflected 
light beam in anyone’s eyes.

People have observed eclipses and maintained records since 
ancient times. When the reasons for eclipses were not known, they 
feared the occurrence of eclipses. As you can imagine, something 
blocking the Sun, the main source of heat and light on the Earth, 
even for a brief period of time, would have been extremely 
concerning. Many superstitions were attached to solar eclipses in 
various parts of the world related to the activities that could not 
be carried out during eclipses—such as eating, cooking, or going 
out of home. But now that we know the reason why a solar eclipse 
occurs, we need not fear these events as long as we do not look at 
the Sun directly. In fact, scientists go around the world to observe 
the eclipses from wherever these are observable. The eclipses 
provide them an opportunity to study phenomena that cannot be 
observed otherwise.

FASCINATING FACTS
An eclipse is known as grahan in Sanskrit and in many Indian languages. 
Many ancient Indian astronomical texts provide calculations to 
predict eclipses. The best known and most referred text is the Surya
Siddhanta, which is written in the classical Sanskrit poetry tradition 
in rhythmic shlokas.

12.3.2 Lunar eclipse
As the Moon revolves around the Earth, sometimes the Earth can 
block the sunlight from reaching the Moon. This is known as a 
lunar eclipse. On such days, we see the Earth’s shadow falling on 
the full disc of the Moon. Fig. 12.16 shows the arrangement of the 
Sun, the Earth, and the Moon during a lunar eclipse.

(The sizes and distances are not to scale in the figure)

When the Moon is completely in the Earth’s shadow, it is 
called a total lunar eclipse. The bright disc of the Moon starts 
to appear dark red in colour and stays that way until the Moon 
moves out of the shadow of the Earth. When part of the Moon 
is in the Earth’s shadow and the rest of the Moon is visible, it 
is called a partial lunar eclipse. Unlike the Sun, we can safely 
watch the eclipsed full Moon with our naked eye. 

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Using the computer version of Stellarium app, which is free, you may 
get information about the upcoming solar and lunar eclipses (if any) 
which may be visible from your location.

FASCINATING FACTS
The Kodaikanal Solar 
Observatory is located in 
the beautiful Palani range of 
hills in southern India. It was 
established in 1899 and has 
provided data about the Sun for 
over 100 years. It is operated 
by the Indian Institute of 
Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru.

KNOW A SCIENTIST
M.K. Vainu Bappu is known as the father of modern 
Indian astronomy. He led efforts in setting up 
many instruments and telescopes in India, such 
as the telescopes at Manora Peak near Nainital 
(Uttarakhand) and Kavalur (Tamil Nadu). The 
observatory at Kavalur has been named after him. 
He mainly studied stars and even discovered a 
comet. He also travelled to different parts of the 
world to study solar eclipses.

In a Nutshell

 The Earth rotates on its own axis in about 24 hours. 
 The Earth’s rotation from West to East causes day and night 

as well as the apparent motion of the Sun, the Moon, and 
the stars.

 The Earth revolves around the Sun and takes nearly 1 year 
to complete a revolution.

 The Earth’s axis of rotation is not upright with respect to the 
orbit, but is tilted.

 Seasons occur because of the tilt of the Earth’s axis of rotation 
and its spherical shape.

 A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon is in the path of the 
Sun as seen from the Earth, and sunlight is blocked from 
reaching the Earth. 

 A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes in between 
the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight from reaching 
the Moon.

9. The Moon is much smaller than the Sun, yet it can block the 
Sun completely from our view during a total solar eclipse. 
Why is it possible?

10. The Indian cricket team matches in Australia are often held 
in December. Should they pack winter or summer clothes for 
their trip?

11. Why do you think lunar eclipses can be seen from a large 
part of the Earth when they happen, but total solar eclipse 
can be seen by only a small part of the Earth?

12. If the Earth’s axis were not tilted with respect to the axis of 
revolution, explain what would be the effect on seasons?

Exploratory Projects

 Repeat Activity 12.2 but replace the torch with an electric 
lamp. Then place  the globe at different positions on a circle 

History Art around the lamp while maintaining the tilt of the globe.
(i) Note down your observations regarding how much of 

the Northern and Southern hemispheres of the globe are 
illuminated at different positions.

Geography Society (ii) Rotate the globe and take a note of the length of the day 
and night on different parts of the globe.

(iii) Repeat (ii) for different positions of globe on the circle.
 The Earth goes around the Sun in an oval-shaped path. 

Technology Economy Draw two circles with the same centre, one with a radius of 
14.7 cm, and another one with a radius of 15.2 cm. If 1 cm 
corresponds to 10 million km, the two circles represent the 
closest and farthest distances from the Sun. Note how small 
is the difference between these two distances.

 Suppose the tilt of the Earth’s axis of rotation increases. Will 
it cause more extreme seasons? Find out if the tilt of Uranus 
is more than the Earth and about the seasons there. Write an 
interesting article for a newspaper or your school magazine 
about it. 

DIVE In reality, the planets move around a special point in 
EEPER the solar system, which is very close to the Sun but 

not exactly at its centre! The Sun also moves around 
the same point a little instead of staying perfectly still. 
Scientists use such tiny wobbles in the movement of 
other stars to discover exoplanets around them!

It's Still Not the End, My Friend!
And once again, we’ve reached the last page of this book, and as 
we said earlier, it is certainly not the end of our curiosity — our 
jigyasa. We hope you’ve enjoyed the activities and experiments as 
you journeyed through the chapters. More importantly, we hope 
you asked a lot of questions! Now it is our time to ask you one.

Have you looked closely at the front and back covers of 
this science textbook? At first, they may just look like regular 
scenes from a playground or a running track, but if you observe 
carefully, you’ll find tiny hidden science clues connected to 
different chapters in the book! Take a closer look — maybe you 
will spot something related to what we discussed about motion 
or light, or maybe even about plants and animals? 

Challenge yourself to find as many science links with the 
chapters as you can (we think there are more than 25!). And 
who knows — you might find connections that the authors and 
illustrators hadn’t even thought about! That is exactly how 
discoveries in science were made — by someone just observing 
something new, something unusual in the world around them.

This textbook is just a small guide, a map to find our way 
around the different paths of science. Never stop asking questions, 
and remember, your curiosity is the spark that lights the flame 
of exploration that will take you to incredible heights. And we’ll 
join you again, next year, for more adventures in science.
