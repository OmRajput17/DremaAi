Balancing a chemical equation
According to the law of conservation of mass, a balanced chemical equation has the same number of 
atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. Many chemical equations can be balanced by 
trial and error. Let us take the reactions of a few metals and non-metals with oxygen to give oxides 
		  4 Fe(s)  +  3O2(g)  → 2Fe2O3(s)		  (a) balanced equation
		  2 Mg(s)  +  O2(g)  → 2MgO(s)		  (b) balanced equation
		  P4(s)   +  O2 (g)  → P4O10(s)		  (c) unbalanced equation
Equations (a) and (b) are balanced, since there are same number of metal and oxygen atoms on 
each side of the equations. However equation (c) is not balanced. In this equation, phosphorus 
atoms are balanced but not the oxygen atoms. To balance it, we must place the coefficient 5 on 
the left of oxygen on the left side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms appearing on the 
right side of the equation.
		  P4(s)  +  5O2(g)  → P4O10(s)		  balanced equation          
Now, let us take combustion of propane, C3H8. This equation can be balanced in steps.
Step 1 Write down the correct formulas of reactants and products. Here, propane and oxygen are 
reactants, and carbon dioxide and water are products.
		  C3H8(g)  +  O2(g) → CO2 (g) + H2O(l)   unbalanced equation
Step 2 Balance the number of C atoms:  Since 3 carbon atoms are in the reactant, therefore, three 
CO2 molecules are required on the right side.
	     	 C3H8 (g)  +  O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g) + H2O (l)
Step 3 Balance the number of H atoms: on the left there are 8 hydrogen atoms in the reactants 
however, each molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms, so four molecules of water will be 
required for eight hydrogen atoms on the right side.
		  C3H8  (g) +O2 (g)  → 3CO2  (g)+4H2O (l)
Step 4 Balance the number of O atoms:  There are 10 oxygen atoms on the right side (3 × 2 = 6 in 
CO2 and 4×1= 4 in water).  Therefore, five O2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10 CO2 
and 4×1= 4 in water).  Therefore, five O2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10 oxygen 
atoms.
		  C3H8 (g) +5O2   (g)  →  3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (l)
Step 5 Verify that the number of atoms of each element is balanced in the final equation. The 
equation shows three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and 10 oxygen atoms on each side.
All equations that have correct formulas for all reactants and products can be balanced. Always 
remember that subscripts in formulas of reactants and products cannot be changed to balance 
an equation.

Summary

Chemistry, as we understand it today is not a very old discipline. People in ancient India, 
already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of 
modern science. They applied the knowledge in various walks of life. 

The study of chemistry is very important as its domain encompasses every sphere 
of life. Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes 
undergone by them. All substances contain matter, which can exist in three states – 
solid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these states 
of matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties. Matter can also be classified 
into elements, compounds or mixtures. An element contains particles of only one type, 
which may be atoms or molecules. The compounds are formed where atoms of two or 
more elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other. Mixtures occur widely and many 
of the substances present around us are mixtures.

When the properties of a substance are studied, measurement is inherent. The 
quantification of properties requires a system of measurement and units in which the 
quantities are to be expressed. Many systems of measurement exist, of which the English

Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry 25

and the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however, has agreed to 
have a uniform and common system throughout the world, which is abbreviated as SI units 
(International System of Units).

Since measurements involve recording of data, which are always associated with a certain 
amount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the quantities 
is very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread over a wide 
range of 10–31 to 10+23. Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers in scientific 
notation is used. The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number of significant 
figures, in which the observations are reported. The dimensional analysis helps to express 
the measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible to interconvert 
the results from one system of units to another.

The combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination 
— these being the Law of Conservation of Mass, Law of Definite Proportions, Law of 
Multiple Proportions, Gay Lussac’s Law of Gaseous Volumes and Avogadro Law. All 
these laws led to the Dalton’s atomic theory, which states that atoms are building blocks 
of matter. The atomic mass of an element is expressed relative to 12C isotope of carbon, 
which has an exact value of 12u. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element is the 
average atomic mass obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of different 
isotopes of that element. The molecular mass of a molecule is obtained by taking sum of 
the atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The molecular formula can be 
calculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present in a compound 
and its molecular mass. 

The number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are 
expressed in the terms of  Avogadro constant (6.022 × 1023). This is known as 1 mol of the 
respective particles or entities.

Chemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements and 
compounds. A balanced chemical equation provides a lot of information. The coefficients 
indicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part in a particular 
reaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called 
stoichiometry. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amount of one or more reactant(s) 
required to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice-versa. The 
amount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is expressed in number of ways, 
e.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.

2.1	 Discovery of Sub-atomic 
Particles

An insight into the structure of atom was 
obtained from the experiments on electrical 
discharge through gases. Before we discuss 
these results we need to keep in mind a 
basic rule regarding the behaviour of charged 
particles : “Like charges repel each other and 
unlike charges attract each other”. Fig. 2.1(a) A cathode ray discharge tube

2.1.1 Discovery of Electron 
In 1830, Michael Faraday showed that if 
electricity is passed through a solution of an 
electrolyte, chemical reactions occurred at the 
electrodes, which resulted in the liberation 
and deposition of matter at the electrodes. 
He formulated certain laws which you will 
study in Class XII. These results suggested 
the particulate nature of electricity. Fig. 2.1(b) 	A cathode ray discharge tube with

characterised in 1919. Later, a need was felt 
for the presence of electrically neutral particle 
as one of the constituent of atom. These 
particles were discovered by Chadwick (1932) 
by bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium 
by α-particles. When electrically neutral 
particles having a mass slightly greater than 
that of protons were emitted. He named 
these particles as neutrons. The important

(i)	 Most of the space in the atom is empty as 

most of the α–particles passed through 
the foil undeflected.

(ii)	 A few positively charged α–particles were 
deflected. The deflection must be due 
to enormous repulsive force showing 
that the positive charge of the atom 
is not spread throughout the atom as 
Thomson had presumed. The positive 
charge has to be concentrated in a very

radiation emitted by such a body is called 
black body radiation. In practice, no such

for hydrogen atom is based on the following 
postulates:
i)	 The electron in the hydrogen atom can 

move around the nucleus in a circular 
path of fixed radius and energy. These 
paths are called orbits, stationary states 
or allowed energy states. These orbits 
are arranged concentrically around the 
nucleus.

ii)	 The energy of an electron in the orbit 
does not change with time. However, 
the electron will move from a lower 
stationary state to a higher stationary 
state when required amount of energy 
is absorbed by the electron or energy is 
emitted when electron moves from higher 
stationary state to lower stationary state 
(equation 2.16). The energy change does 
not take place in a continuous manner.

Orbit, orbital and its importance
Orbit and orbital are not synonymous. An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path around the 
nucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the electron is impossible 
according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore, have no real meaning and 
their existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An atomic orbital, on the other hand, 
is a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one electron wave function ψ in an atom. It is 
characterized by three quantum numbers (n, l and ml) and its value depends upon the coordinates 
of the electron. ψ has, by itself, no physical meaning. It is the square of the wave function i.e., |ψ|2 
which has a physical meaning. |ψ|2 at any point in an atom gives the value of probability density 
at that point. Probability density (|ψ|2) is the probability per unit volume and the product of |ψ|2 
and a small volume (called a volume element) yields the probability of finding the electron in that 
volume (the reason for specifying a small volume element is that |ψ|2 varies from one region to 
another in space but its value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element). 
The total probability of finding the electron in a given volume can then be calculated by the sum 
of all the products of |ψ|2 and the corresponding volume elements. It is thus possible to get the 
probable distribution of an electron in an orbital.

What is the total number of orbitals

Solution
For n = 3, the possible values of l are 
0, 1 and 2. Thus there is one 3s orbital  
(n = 3, l = 0 and ml = 0); there are three 
3p orbitals (n = 3, l = 1 and ml = –1, 0, 
+1); there are five 3d orbitals (n = 3, l = 
2 and ml = –2, –1, 0, +1+, +2). Fig. 2.12	 The plots of (a) the orbital wave

probability density in that region.

Boundary surface diagrams of constant 
probability density for different orbitals give 
a fairly good representation of the shapes 
of the orbitals. In this representation, a 
boundary surface or contour surface is 
drawn in space for an orbital on which the 
value of probability density |ψ|2 is constant. 
In principle many such boundary surfaces 
may be possible. However, for a given 
orbital, only that boundary surface diagram

which bounds a region in which the probability 
of finding the electron is, 100 %? The answer 
to this question is that the probability density 
|ψ|2 has always some value, howsoever 
small it may be, at any finite distance from 
the nucleus. It is therefore, not possible to 
draw a boundary surface diagram of a rigid 
size in which the probability of finding the

for a s orbital is actually a sphere centred on 
the nucleus. In two dimensions, this sphere 
looks like a circle. It encloses a region in 
which probability of finding the electron is 
about 90%.

Thus, we see that 1s and 2s orbitals are 
spherical in shape. In reality all the s-orbitals

at zero and infinite distance, as the distance 
from the nucleus increases. The number of 
nodes are given by the n –2, that is number 
of radial node is 1 for 3p orbital, two for 4p 
orbital and so on.

For l = 2, the orbital is known as d-orbital 
and the minimum value of principal quantum 
number (n) has to be 3. as the value of l cannot 
be greater than n–1. There are five ml values 
(–2, –1, 0, +1 and +2) for l = 2 and thus there 
are five d orbitals. The boundary surface 
diagram of d orbitals are shown in Fig. 2.15.

The five d-orbitals are designated as dxy, 
dyz, dxz, dx2–y2 and dz2. The shapes of the first 
four d-orbitals are similar to each other, where 
as that of the fifth one, dz2, is different from 
others, but all five 3d orbitals are equivalent 
in energy. The d orbitals for which n is greater 
than 3 (4d, 5d...) also have shapes similar to 
3d orbital, but differ in energy and size.

Besides the radial nodes (i.e., probability 
density function is zero), the probability 
density functions for the np and nd orbitals 
are zero at the plane (s), passing through the 
nucleus (origin). For example, in case of pz 
orbital, xy-plane is a nodal plane, in case of 
dxy orbital, there are two nodal planes passing 
through the origin and bisecting the xy plane 
containing z-axis. These are called angular 
nodes and number of angular nodes are given 
by ‘l’, i.e., one angular node for p orbitals, two 
angular nodes for ‘d’ orbitals and so on. The 
total number of nodes are given by (n–1), 
i.e., sum of l angular nodes and (n – l – 1) 
radial nodes.

number (Z ). of (n+l ) Rule

Both the attractive and repulsive 
interactions depend upon the shell and shape 
of the orbital in which the electron is present. 
For example electrons present in spherical 
shaped, s orbital shields the outer electrons 
from the nucleus more effectively as compared 
to electrons present in p orbital. Similarly 
electrons present in p orbitals shield the outer 
electrons from the nucleus more than the 
electrons present in d orbitals, even though all 
these orbitals are present in the same shell. 
Further within a shell, due to spherical shape 
of s orbital, the s orbital electron spends more 
time close to the nucleus in comparison to p 
orbital electron which spends more time in 
the vicinity of nucleus in comparison to d 
orbital electron. In other words, for a given 
shell (principal quantum number), the Zeff 
experienced by the electron decreases with 
increase of azimuthal quantum number (l), 
that is, the s orbital electron will be more 
tightly bound to the nucleus than p orbital 
electron which in turn will be better tightly 
bound than the d orbital electron. The energy 
of electrons in s orbital will be lower (more 
negative) than that of p orbital electron

The order may be remembered by using Pauli Exclusion Principle
the method given in Fig. 2.17. Starting from The number of electrons to be filled in various 

orbitals is restricted by the exclusion principle, 
given by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli 
(1926). According to this principle : No two 
electrons in an atom can have the same set 
of four quantum numbers. Pauli exclusion 
principle can also be stated as : “Only two 
electrons may exist in the same orbital and 
these electrons must have opposite spin.” 
This means that the two electrons can have 
the same value of three quantum numbers 
n, l and ml, but must have the opposite spin 
quantum number. The restriction imposed 
by Pauli’s exclusion principle on the number 
of electrons in an orbital helps in calculating 
the capacity of electrons to be present in any 
subshell. For example, subshell 1s comprises 
one orbital and thus the maximum number of 
electrons present in 1s subshell can be two, in 
p and d subshells, the maximum number of 
electrons can be 6 and 10 and so on. This can 
be summed up as : the maximum number 
of electrons in the shell with principal 
quantum number n is equal to 2n2.
Hund’s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity
This rule deals with the filling of electrons into 
the orbitals belonging to the same subshell 
(that is, orbitals of equal energy, called

Causes of Stability of Completely Filled and Half-filled Subshells

The completely filled and completely 
half-filled subshells are stable due to the 
following reasons:
1.Symmetrical distribution of 
electrons: It is well known that symmetry 
leads to stability. The completely filled 
or half filled subshells have symmetrical 
distribution of electrons in them and 
are therefore more stable. Electrons in 
the same subshell (here 3d) have equal 
energy but different spatial distribution. 
Consequently, their shielding of one-
another is relatively small and the 
electrons are more strongly attracted by 
the nucleus.
2. Exchange Energy : The stabilizing 
effect arises whenever two or more 
electrons with the same spin are present 
in the degenerate orbitals of a subshell. 
These electrons tend to exchange their 
positions and the energy released due to 
this exchange is called exchange energy. 
The number of exchanges that can take 
place is maximum when the subshell 
is either half filled or completely filled 
(Fig. 2.18). As a result the exchange 
energy is maximum and so is the stability.
	 You may note that the exchange 
energy is at the basis of Hund’s rule 
that electrons which enter orbitals of 
equal energy have parallel spins as far 
as possible. In other words, the extra 
stability of half-filled and completely filled 
subshell is  due to: (i) relatively small 
shielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion 
energy, and (iii) larger exchange energy.

Summary

Atoms are the building blocks of elements. They are the smallest parts of an element that 
chemically react. The first atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, regarded atom as 
the ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was 
proved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles: 
electrons, protons and neutrons. The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal 
of various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.

Thomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity 
with electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to 
be evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle 
scattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively 
charged nucleus, at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits. 
Rutherford model, which resembles the solar system, was no doubt an improvement over 
Thomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e., why the electron 
does not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of 
atoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The 
difficulties of the Rutherford model were overcome by Niels Bohr in 1913 in his model of the 
hydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in circular orbits. 
Only certain orbits can exist and each orbit corresponds to a specific energy. Bohr calculated 
the energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the 
electron and nucleus. Bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the 
spectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron atoms. The 
reason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged 
particle moving in a well defined circular orbit about the nucleus. The wave character of 
the electron is ignored in Bohr’s theory. An orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can 
completely be defined only if both the exact position and the exact velocity of the electron 
at the same time are known. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty 
principle. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour 
of electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle. 

Erwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to 
describe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This 
equation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with 
Heisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a 
hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and 
the corresponding wave function(s) (ψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the 
electron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding 
wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal 
quantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number ml) 
arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions 
on the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The 
quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the 
hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the 
Bohr model.

According to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an 
atom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought 
to consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or 
more orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems 
(such as He+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of 
the orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value 
of (n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (n + l ) value, 
the orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are

possible and electrons are filled in those orbitals in order of increasing energy in accordance 
with Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four 
quantum numbers) and Hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity (pairing of electrons in the 
orbitals belonging to the same subshell does not take place until each orbital belonging to 
that subshell has got one electron each, i.e., is singly occupied). This forms the basis of the 
electronic structure of atoms.

SUMMARY

In this Unit, you have studied the development of the Periodic Law and the Periodic Table. 
Mendeleev’s Periodic Table was based on atomic masses. Modern Periodic Table arranges 
the elements in the order of their atomic numbers in seven horizontal rows (periods) and 
eighteen vertical columns (groups or families). Atomic numbers in a period are consecutive, 
whereas in a group they increase in a pattern. Elements of the same group have similar 
valence shell electronic configuration and, therefore, exhibit similar chemical properties. 
However, the elements of the same period have incrementally increasing number of electrons 
from left to right, and, therefore, have different valencies. Four types of elements can be 
recognized in the periodic table on the basis of their electronic configurations. These are 
s-block, p-block, d-block and f-block elements. Hydrogen with one electron in the 1s orbital 
occupies a unique position in the periodic table. Metals comprise more than seventy eight 
per cent of the known elements. Non-metals, which are located at the top of the periodic 
table, are less than twenty in number. Elements which lie at the border line between metals 
and non-metals (e.g., Si, Ge, As) are called metalloids or semi-metals. Metallic character 
increases with increasing atomic number in a group whereas decreases from left to right 
in a period. The physical and chemical properties of elements vary periodically with their 
atomic numbers.

 Periodic trends are observed in atomic sizes, ionization enthalpies, electron gain 
enthalpies, electronegativity and valence. The atomic radii decrease while going from 
left to right in a period and increase with atomic number in a group. Ionization enthalpies 
generally increase across a period and decrease down a group. Electronegativity also shows 
a similar trend. Electron gain enthalpies, in general, become more negative across a period 
and less negative down a group. There is some periodicity in valence, for example, among 
representative elements, the valence is either equal to the number of electrons in the 
outermost orbitals or eight minus this number. Chemical reactivity is highest at the two 
extremes of a period and is lowest in the centre. The reactivity on the left extreme of a period 
is because of the ease of electron loss (or low ionization enthalpy). Highly reactive elements 
do not occur in nature in free state; they usually occur in the combined form. Oxides formed 
of the elements on the left are basic and of the elements on the right are acidic in nature. 
Oxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric or neutral.

Since lattice enthalpy plays a key role

4.2.1	 Lattice Enthalpy
The Lattice Enthalpy of an ionic solid 
is defined as the energy required to 
completely separate one mole of a solid 
ionic compound into gaseous constituent 
ions. For example, the lattice enthalpy of 
NaCl is 788 kJ mol–1. This means that 788 Fig. 4.1  The bond length in a covalent

Bond length is defined as the equilibrium 
distance between the nuclei of two bonded 
atoms in a molecule. Bond lengths are 
measured by spectroscopic, X-ray diffraction 
and electron-diffraction techniques about 
which you will learn in higher classes. Each 
atom of the bonded pair contributes to the 
bond length (Fig. 4.1). In the case of a covalent 
bond, the contribution from each atom is 
called the covalent radius of that atom. 

The covalent radius is measured 
approximately as the radius of an atom’s 
core which is in contact with the core of an Fig. 4.2	 Covalent and van der Waals radii in

4.5.2  Directional Properties of Bonds
As we have already seen, the covalent bond 
is formed by overlapping of atomic orbitals. 
The molecule of hydrogen is formed due to the 
overlap of 1s-orbitals of two H atoms.

In case of polyatomic molecules like CH4, 
NH3 and H2O, the geometry of the molecules 
is also important in addition to the bond 
formation. For example why is it so that CH4 
molecule has tetrahedral shape and HCH 
bond angles are 109.5°? Why is the shape of 
NH3 molecule pyramidal ?

The valence bond theory explains the 
shape, the formation and directional properties 
of bonds in polyatomic molecules like CH4, 
NH3 and H2O, etc. in terms of overlap and 
hybridisation of atomic orbitals.
4.5.3	 Overlapping of Atomic Orbitals
When orbitals of two atoms come close to form 
bond, their overlap may be positive, negative 
or zero depending upon the sign (phase) and 
direction of orientation of amplitude of orbital 
wave function in space (Fig. 4.9). Positive and 
negative sign on boundary surface diagrams

SUMMARY

Kössel’s first insight into the mechanism of formation of electropositive and electronegative 
ions related the process to the attainment of noble gas configurations by the respective ions. 
Electrostatic attraction between ions is the cause for their stability. This gives the concept 
of electrovalency.

The first description of covalent bonding was provided by Lewis in terms of the sharing 
of electron pairs between atoms and he related the process to the attainment of noble gas 
configurations by reacting atoms as a result of sharing of electrons. The Lewis dot symbols 
show the number of valence electrons of the atoms of a given element and Lewis dot structures 
show pictorial representations of bonding in molecules. 

An ionic compound is pictured as a three-dimensional aggregation of positive and negative 
ions in an ordered arrangement called the crystal lattice. In a crystalline solid there is a 
charge balance between the positive and negative ions. The crystal lattice is stabilized by 
the enthalpy of lattice formation. 

While a single covalent bond is formed by sharing of an electron pair between two atoms, 
multiple bonds result from the sharing of two or three electron pairs. Some bonded atoms 
have additional pairs of electrons not involved in bonding. These are called lone-pairs of 
electrons. A Lewis dot structure shows the arrangement of bonded pairs and lone pairs around 
each atom in a molecule. Important parameters, associated with chemical bonds, like: 
bond length, bond angle, bond enthalpy, bond order and bond polarity have significant 
effect on the properties of compounds.

A number of molecules and polyatomic ions cannot be described accurately by a single 
Lewis structure and a number of descriptions (representations) based on the same skeletal 
structure are written and these taken together represent the molecule or ion. This is a very 
important and extremely useful concept called resonance. The contributing structures 
or canonical forms taken together constitute the resonance hybrid which represents the 
molecule or ion.

Chemical Bonding And Molecular Structure 133

The VSEPR model used for predicting the geometrical shapes of molecules is based on 
the assumption that electron pairs repel each other and, therefore, tend to remain as far 
apart as possible. According to this model, molecular geometry is determined by repulsions 
between lone pairs and lone pairs; lone pairs and bonding pairs and bonding pairs and bonding 
pairs. The order of these repulsions being : lp-lp > lp-bp > bp-bp

The valence bond (VB) approach to covalent bonding is basically concerned with the 
energetics of covalent bond formation about which the Lewis and VSEPR models are silent. 
Basically the VB theory discusses bond formation  in terms of overlap of orbitals. For example 
the formation of the H2 molecule from two hydrogen atoms involves the overlap of the 1s 
orbitals of the two H atoms which are singly occupied. It is seen that the potential energy 
of the system gets lowered as the two H atoms come near to each other. At the equilibrium 
inter-nuclear distance (bond distance) the energy touches a minimum. Any attempt to bring 
the nuclei still closer results in a sudden increase in energy and consequent destabilization 
of the molecule. Because of orbital overlap the electron density between the nuclei increases 
which helps in bringing them closer. It is however seen that the actual bond enthalpy and 
bond length values are not obtained by overlap alone and other variables have to be taken 
into account. 

For explaining the characteristic shapes of polyatomic molecules Pauling introduced the 
concept of hybridisation of atomic orbitals. sp, sp2, sp3 hybridizations of atomic orbitals 
of Be, B, C, N and O are used to explain the formation and geometrical shapes of molecules 
like BeCl2, BCl3, CH4, NH3 and H2O. They also explain the formation of multiple bonds in 
molecules like C2H2 and C2H4.  

The molecular orbital (MO) theory describes bonding in terms of the combination and 
arrangment of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals that are associated with the molecule 
as a whole. The number of molecular orbitals are always equal to the number of atomic 
orbitals from which they are formed. Bonding molecular orbitals increase electron density 
between the nuclei and are lower in energy than the individual atomic orbitals. Antibonding 
molecular orbitals have a region of zero electron density between the nuclei and have more 
energy than the individual atomic orbitals.

The electronic configuration of the molecules is written by filling electrons in the molecular 
orbitals in the order of increasing energy levels. As in the case of atoms, the Pauli exclusion 
principle and Hund’s rule are applicable for the filling of molecular orbitals. Molecules are 
said to be stable if the number of elctrons in bonding molecular orbitals is greater than that 
in antibonding molecular orbitals.

Hydrogen bond is formed when a hydrogen atom finds itself between two highly 
electronegative atoms such as F, O and N. It may be intermolecular (existing between two 
or more molecules of the same or different substances) or intramolecular (present within 
the same molecule). Hydrogen bonds have a powerful effect on the structure and properties 
of many compounds.

Summary

Thermodynamics deals with energy changes in chemical or physical processes and enables us to 
study these changes quantitatively and to make useful predictions. For these purposes, we divide 
the universe into the system and the surroundings. Chemical or physical processes lead to evolution 
or absorption of heat (q), part of which may be converted into work (w). These quantities are related 
through the first law of thermodynamics via ∆U = q + w. ∆U,  change in internal energy, depends 
on initial and final states only and is a state function, whereas q and w depend on the path and 
are not the state functions. We follow sign conventions of q and w by giving the positive sign to 
these quantities when these are added to the system. We can measure the transfer of heat from one 
system to another which causes the change in temperature. The magnitude of rise in temperature 
depends on the heat capacity (C) of a substance. Therefore, heat absorbed or evolved is q =  C∆T. 
Work can be measured by w = –pex∆V, in case of expansion of gases. Under reversible process, we 
can put pex = p for infinitesimal changes in the volume making wrev = – p dV. In this condition, we 
can use gas equation, pV = nRT.

At constant volume, w = 0, then ∆U = qV , heat transfer at constant volume. But in study of 
chemical reactions, we usually have constant pressure. We define another state function enthalpy. 
Enthalpy change, ∆H = ∆U + ∆ngRT, can be found directly from the heat changes at constant pressure, 
∆H = qp.

There are varieties of enthalpy changes. Changes of phase such as melting, vaporization and 
sublimation usually occur at constant temperature and can be characterized by enthalpy changes 
which are always positive. Enthalpy of formation, combustion and other enthalpy changes can be 
calculated using Hess’s law. Enthalpy change for chemical reactions can be determined by

rH  ai f H products   bi f H reactions 
f i

and in gaseous state by
∆rH

 =	 Σ bond enthalpies of the reactants – Σ bond enthalpies of the products
First law of thermodynamics does not guide us about the direction of chemical 

reactions i.e., what is the driving force of a chemical reaction. For isolated systems, 
∆U = 0. We define another state function, S, entropy for this purpose. Entropy is a measure 
of disorder or randomness. For a spontaneous change, total entropy change is positive. 
Therefore, for an isolated system, ∆U = 0, ∆S > 0, so entropy change distinguishes a spontaneous 
change, while energy change does not. Entropy changes can be measured by the equation 

q
∆S = rev q

T  for a reversible process. rev  is independent of path.
T

Chemical reactions are generally carried at constant pressure, so we define another state function 
Gibbs energy, G, which is related to entropy and enthalpy changes of the system by the equation:

∆rG =	 ∆rH – T ∆rS
For a spontaneous change, ∆Gsys < 0 and at equilibrium, ∆Gsys = 0.
Standard Gibbs energy change is related to equilibrium constant by
∆rG

 = – RT ln K.
K can be calculated from this equation, if we know ∆rG

 which can be found from 
. Temperature is an important factor in the equation. Many reactions which 

are non-spontaneous at low temperature, are made spontaneous at high temperature for systems 
having positive entropy of reaction.

Dynamic Equilibrium – A Student’s Activity
Equilibrium whether in a physical or in a chemical system, is always of dynamic nature. This can 
be demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible in a school laboratory. 
However this concept can be easily comprehended by performing the following activity. The activity 
can be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students.

Take two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes each of 
30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of 3-5mm. Fill 
nearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this purpose add a crystal 
of potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder (number 2) empty. 

Put one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder 1, 
close its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its lower portion to 
cylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2nd cylinder, transfer the coloured water in a similar manner 
from cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring coloured water using the two glass 
tubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you notice that the level of coloured water in both 
the cylinders becomes constant.

If you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will not be 
any further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take analogy of ‘level’ of 
coloured water with ‘concentration’ of reactants and products in the two cylinders, we can say 
the process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy of level, is indicative of dynamic 
nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking two tubes of different diameters we find 
that at equilibrium the level of coloured water in two cylinders is different. How far diameters are 
responsible for change in levels in two cylinders? Empty cylinder (2) is an indicator of no product 
in it at the beginning.

Similarly let us consider the reaction,

equal initial concentration of H2 and I2, the 
reaction proceeds in the forward direction 
and the concentration of H2 and I2 decreases 
while that of HI increases, until all of these 
become constant at equilibrium (Fig. 6.5). We 
can also start with HI alone and make the 
reaction to proceed in the reverse direction; 
the concentration of HI will decrease and 
concentration of H2 and I2 will increase until 
they all become constant when equilibrium is 
reached (Fig. 6.5).  If total number of H and I

this mixture is analysed, it is found that the

that ammonia and all deuterium containing

conclude that scrambling of H and D atoms in

Faraday was born near London into a family of very limited means. At the age of 
14 he was an apprentice to a kind bookbinder who allowed Faraday to read the 
books he was binding. Through a fortunate chance he became laboratory assistant 
to Davy, and during 1813-4, Faraday accompanied him to the Continent.  During 
this trip he gained much from the experience of coming into contact with many of the 
leading scientists of the time.  In 1825, he succeeded Davy as Director of the Royal 
Institution laboratories, and in 1833 he also became the first Fullerian Professor of 
Chemistry. Faraday’s first important work was on analytical chemistry. After 1821

He discovered his two laws of electrolysis in 1834. Faraday was a very modest and kind hearted 
person.  He declined all honours and avoided scientific controversies. He preferred to work alone and 
never had any assistant. He disseminated science in a variety of ways including his Friday evening 
discourses, which he founded at the Royal Institution.  He has been very famous for his Christmas 
lecture on the ‘Chemical History of a Candle’.  He published nearly 450 scientific papers.

Arrhenius was born near Uppsala, Sweden. He presented his thesis, on the 
conductivities of electrolyte solutions, to the University of Uppsala in 1884.  For the 
next five years he travelled extensively and visited a number of research centers 
in Europe. In 1895 he was appointed professor of physics at the newly formed 
University of Stockholm, serving its rector from 1897 to 1902.  From 1905 until his 
death he was Director of physical chemistry at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm.  He 
continued to work for many years on electrolytic solutions.  In 1899 he discussed 
the temperature dependence of reaction rates on the basis of an equation, now 
usually known as Arrhenius equation.

(1859-1927) immunochemistry, cosmology, the origin of life, and the causes of ice age. He was

EQUILIBRIUM 207

SUMMARY

When the number of molecules leaving the liquid to vapour equals the number of molecules 
returning to the liquid from vapour, equilibrium is said to be attained and is dynamic in 
nature. Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical processes and at 
this stage rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Equilibrium constant, Kc is 
expressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants, each term raised to the 
stoichiometric coefficient.

For reaction, a A + b B        c C +d D
Kc = [C]c[D]d/[A]a[B]b

Equilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage all the 
macroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. become constant. For a gaseous 
reaction equilibrium constant is expressed as Kp and is written by replacing concentration 
terms by partial pressures in Kc expression. The direction of reaction can be predicted by 
reaction quotient Qc which is equal to Kc at equilibrium. Le Chatelier’s principle states that 
the change in any factor such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc. will cause the 
equilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce or counteract the effect of the change. 
It can be used to study the effect of various factors such as temperature, concentration, 
pressure, catalyst and inert gases on the direction of equilibrium and to control the yield of 
products by controlling these factors. Catalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition 
of a reaction mixture but increases the rate of chemical reaction by making available a new 
lower energy pathway for conversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.

All substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes. Acids, 
bases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous solutions 
is due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of electrolytes 
in aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In weak electrolytes 
there is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte molecules. According to 
Arrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous 
solutions. Brönsted-Lowry on the other hand, defined an acid as a proton donor and a base as 
a proton acceptor. When a Brönsted-Lowry acid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate 
base and a conjugate acid corresponding to the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate 
pair of acid-base differs only by one proton. Lewis further generalised the definition of an 
acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions 
for ionization (equilibrium) constants of weak acids (Ka) and weak bases (Kb) are developed 
using Arrhenius definition. The degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and 
common ion are discussed. The pH scale (pH = –log[H+]) for the hydrogen ion concentration 
(activity) has been introduced and extended to other quantities (pOH = – log[OH–]); pKa = –log[Ka]; 
pKb = –log[Kb]; and pKw = –log[Kw] etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and we 
note that the equation: pH + pOH = pKw is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid and 
weak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo hydrolysis in 
aqueous solution. The definition of buffer solutions,  and their importance are discussed 
briefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed and the equilibrium 
constant is introduced as solubility product constant (Ksp). Its relationship with solubility 
of the salt is established. The conditions of precipitation of the salt from their solutions 
or their dissolution in water are worked out. The role of common ion and the solubility of 
sparingly soluble salts is also discussed.

A careful examination of reaction (7.3) in processes:

which hydrogen has been replaced by oxygen 2 HgO (s)   2 Hg (l) + O2 (g)	 (7.8)
prompted chemists to reinterpret oxidation (removal of oxygen from mercuric oxide )
in terms of removal of hydrogen from it and, 2 FeCl3 (aq) + H2 (g) →2 FeCl2 (aq) + 2 HCl(aq)
therefore, the scope of term oxidation was (7.9)

The Paradox of Fractional Oxidation Number
Sometimes, we come across with certain compounds in which the oxidation number of a particular 
element in the compound is in fraction. Examples are:
C3O2 [where oxidation number of carbon  is (4/3)], 
Br3O8 [where oxidation number of bromine is (16/3)] 
and Na2S4O6 (where oxidation number of sulphur is 2.5).

We know that the idea of fractional oxidation number is unconvincing to us, because electrons 
are never shared/transferred in fraction. Actually this fractional oxidation state is the average 
oxidation state of the element under examination and the structural parameters reveal that the 
element for whom fractional oxidation state is realised is present in different oxidation states.

6  (tetrathionate ion) 

The element marked with asterisk in each species is exhibiting the different oxidation 
state (oxidation number) from rest of the atoms  of the same element in each of the species. 
This reveals that in C3O2, two carbon atoms are present in +2 oxidation state each, whereas 
the third one is present in zero oxidation state and the average is 4/3. However, the realistic 
picture is +2 for two terminal carbons and zero for the middle carbon. Likewise in Br3O8, each 
of the two terminal bromine atoms are present in +6 oxidation state and the middle bromine 
is present in +4 oxidation state. Once again the average, that is different from reality, is  
16/3. In the same fashion, in the species S 2

4O

6 , each of the two extreme sulphurs exhibits oxidation 
state of +5 and the two middle sulphurs as zero. The average of four  oxidation numbers of sulphurs 
of the S4O

6 is 2.5, whereas the reality being + 5,0,0 and +5 oxidation number respectively for 

each sulphur.
We may thus, in general, conclude that the idea of fractional oxidation state should be taken 

with care and the reality is revealed by the structures only. Further, whenever we come across 
with fractional oxidation state of any particular element in any species, we must understand that 
this is the average oxidation number only. In reality (revealed by structures only), the element in 
that particular species is present in more than one whole number oxidation states. Fe3O4, Mn3O4, 
Pb3O4 are some of the other examples of the compounds, which are mixed oxides, where we come 
across with fractional oxidation states of the metal atom. However, the oxidation states may be in 
fraction as in O+

2 and O –
2 where it is +½ and –½ respectively.

SUMMARY 

Redox reactions form an important class of reactions in which oxidation and reduction 
occur simultaneously. Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation 
number, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail. Oxidation, 
reduction, oxidising agent (oxidant) and reducing agent (reductant) have been viewed 
according to each conceptualisation. Oxidation numbers are assigned in accordance with a 
consistent set of rules. Oxidation number and ion-electron method both are useful means in 
writing equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories: 
combination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions. The concept of 
redox couple and electrode processes is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide 
applications in the study of electrode processes and cells.

Molecular Models
Molecular models are physical devices 
that are used for a better visualisation and 
perception of three-dimensional shapes 
of organic molecules. These are made of 
wood, plastic or metal and are commercially 
available. Commonly three types of molecular 
models are used: (1) Framework model, (2) 
Ball-and-stick model, and (3) Space filling 
model. In the framework model only the 
bonds connecting the atoms of a molecule 
and not the atoms themselves are shown. 
This model emphasizes the pattern of 
bonds of a molecule while ignoring the size 
of atoms. In the ball-and-stick model, both 
the atoms and the bonds are shown. Balls 
represent atoms and the stick denotes a 
bond. Compounds containing C=C (e.g.,

springs in place of sticks. These models are

8.4	 Classification of Organic (homocyclic).
Compounds

The existing large number of organic 
compounds and their ever -increasing 
numbers has made it necessary to classify 
them on the basis of their structures. Organic Cyclopropane Cyclohexane Cyclohexene
compounds are broadly classified as follows:

Sometimes atoms other than carbon are 
also present in the ring (heterocylic). 
Tetrahydrofuran given below is an example 
of this type of compound:

                	        

Tetrahydrofuran
These exhibit some of the properties similar 
to those of aliphatic compounds.

(b) Aromatic compounds
Aromatic compounds are special types of 
compounds. You will learn about these 
compounds in detail in Unit 9. These include 
benzene and other related ring compounds 
(benzenoid). Like alicyclic compounds, 
aromatic comounds may also have hetero 
atom in the ring. Such compounds are called

8.4.2 Homologous Series
A group or a series of organic compounds each 
containing a characteristic functional group 
forms a homologous series and the members of 
the series are called homologues. The members 
of a homologous series can be represented by 
general molecular formula and the successive 
members differ from each other in molecular 
formula by a –Ch2 unit. There are a number 
of homologous series of organic compounds. 
Some of these are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, 
haloalkanes, alkanols, alkanals, alkanones, 
alkanoic acids, amines etc.
	 It is also possible that a compound contains 
two or more identical or different functional 
groups. This gives rise to polyfunctional 
compounds.

8.8	M ethods of Purification of 
Organic Compounds

Once an organic compound is extracted 
from a natural source or synthesised in the 
laboratory, it is essential to purify it. Various 
methods used for the purification of organic 
compounds are based on the nature of the 
compound and the impurity present in it. 

The common techniques used for 
purification are as follows :
(i)	 Sublimation
(ii)	 Crystallisation
(iii)	 Distillation
(iv)	 Differential extraction and
(v)	 Chromatography	

Finally, the purity of a compound is 
ascertained by determining its melting or 
boiling point. Most of the pure compounds 
have sharp melting points and boiling points. 

The hyperconjugation may also be New methods of checking the purity of an

The purification technique based on the above 
principle is known as sublimation and is used 
to separate sublimable compounds from non-
sublimable impurities.

8.8.2	C rystallisation
This is one of the most commonly used 
techniques for the purification of solid organic 
compounds. It is based on the difference in 
the solubilities of the compound and the 
impurities in a suitable solvent. The impure 
compound is dissolved in a solvent in which it 
is sparingly soluble at room temperature but 
appreciably soluble at higher temperature. 
The solution is concentrated to get a nearly 
saturated solution. On cooling the solution, 
pure compound crystallises out and is 
removed by filtration. The filtrate (mother 
liquor) contains impurities and small quantity 
of the compound. If the compound is highly 
soluble in one solvent and very little  soluble

theoretical plate.  Commercially, columns 
with hundreds of plates are available.

One of the technological applications of 
fractional distillation is to separate different 
fractions of crude oil in petroleum industry.

Distillation under reduced 
pressure: This method is 
used to purify liquids having 
very high boiling points and 
those, which decompose at 
or below their boiling points. 
Such liquids are made to boil 
at a temperature lower than 
their normal boiling points 
by reducing the pressure on 
their surface. A liquid boils 
at a temperature at which its 
vapour pressure is equal to 
the external pressure. The 
pressure is reduced with 
the help of a water pump 
or vacuum pump (Fig.8.8).

time the vapours reach to the top of the 
fractionating column, these are rich in the 
more volatile component. Fractionating 
columns are available in various sizes and 
designs as shown in Fig.8.7. A fractionating 
column provides many surfaces for heat 
exchange between the ascending vapours 
and the descending condensed liquid.  Some 
of the condensing liquid in the fractionating 
column obtains heat from the ascending 
vapours and revaporises.  The vapours thus 
become richer in low boiling component.  The 
vapours of low boiling component ascend 
to the top of the column. On reaching the 
top, the vapours become pure in low boiling 
component and pass through the condenser 
and the pure liquid is collected in a receiver. 
After a series of successive distillations, the 
remaining liquid in the distillation flask gets 
enriched in high boiling component. Each 
successive condensation and vaporisation Fig.8.7	 Different types of fractionating columns.

name chromatography is based on the Greek 
word chroma, for colour since the method 
was first used for the separation of coloured 
substances found in plants. In this technique, 
the mixture of substances is applied onto a 
stationary phase, which may be a solid or a 
liquid. A pure solvent, a mixture of solvents, 
or a gas is allowed to move slowly over the 
stationary phase. The components of the 
mixture get gradually separated from one 
another. The moving phase is called the 
mobile phase.

Based on the principle involved, 
chromatography is classified into different 
categories. Two of these are:

organic chemistry – some basic principles and techniques 291

Summary

In this unit, we have learnt some basic concepts in structure and reactivity of organic 
compounds, which are formed due to covalent bonding. The nature of the covalent bonding 
in organic compounds can be described in terms of orbitals hybridisation concept, 
according to which carbon can have sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised orbitals. The sp3, sp2 and sp 
hybridised carbons are found in compounds like methane, ethene and ethyne respectively. 
The tetrahedral shape of methane, planar shape of ethene and linear shape of ethyne can 
be understood on the basis of this concept. A sp3 hybrid orbital can overlap with 1s orbital 
of hydrogen to give a carbon - hydrogen (C–H) single bond (sigma, σ bond). Overlap of a sp2 
orbital of one carbon with sp2 orbital of another results in the formation of a carbon–carbon 
σ bond. The unhybridised p orbitals on two adjacent carbons can undergo lateral (side-
by-side) overlap to give a pi (π) bond. Organic compounds can be represented by various 
structural formulas. The three dimensional representation of organic compounds on paper 
can be drawn by wedge and dash formula.

Organic compounds can be classified on the basis of their structure or the functional 
groups they contain. A functional group is an atom or group of atoms bonded together in a 
unique fashion and which determines the physical and  chemical properties of the compounds. 
The naming of the organic compounds is carried out by following a set of rules laid down by 
the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). In IUPAC nomenclature, 
the names are correlated with the structure in such a way that the reader can deduce the 
structure from the name.

Organic reaction mechanism concepts are based on the structure of the substrate 
molecule, fission of a covalent bond, the attacking reagents, the electron displacement effects 
and the conditions of the reaction. These organic reactions involve breaking and making 
of covalent bonds. A covalent bond may be cleaved in heterolytic or homolytic fashion. 
A heterolytic cleavage yields carbocations or carbanions, while a homolytic cleavage gives 
free radicals as reactive intermediate. Reactions proceeding through heterolytic cleavage 
involve the complimentary pairs of reactive species. These are electron pair donor known as 
nucleophile and an electron pair acceptor known as electrophile. The inductive, resonance, 
electromeric and hyperconjugation effects may help in the polarisation of a bond making 
certain carbon atom or other atom positions as places of low or high electron densities.

Organic reactions can be broadly classified into following types; substitution, addition, 
elimination and rearrangement reactions. 

Purification, qualitative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds are carried out 
for determining their structures. The methods of purification namely : sublimation, distillation 
and differential extraction are based on the difference in one or more physical properties. 
Chromatography is a useful technique of separation, identification and purification of 
compounds. It is classified into two categories : adsorption and partition chromatography. 
Adsorption chromatography is based on differential adsorption of various components of a 
mixture on an adsorbent. Partition chromatography involves continuous partitioning of the 
components of a mixture between stationary and mobile phases. After getting the compound 
in a pure form, its qualitative analysis is carried out for detection of elements present in it. 
Nitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus are detected by Lassaigne’s test. Carbon and 
hydrogen are estimated by determining the amounts of carbon dioxide and water produced. 
Nitrogen is estimated by Dumas or Kjeldahl’s method and halogens by Carius method. 
Sulphur and phosphorus are estimated by oxidising them to sulphuric and phosphoric acids 
respectively. The percentage of oxygen is usually determined by difference between the total 
percentage (100) and the sum of percentages of all other elements present.

reaction is used as a test for unsaturation. 
Addition of halogens to alkenes is an 
example of electrophilic addition reaction 
involving cyclic halonium ion formation (9.42)
which you will study in higher classes. Markovnikov, a Russian chemist made a 

generalisation in 1869 after studying such 
reactions in detail. These generalisations 
led Markovnikov to frame a rule called 
Markovnikov rule. The rule states that 
negative part of the addendum (adding 

(9.38) molecule) gets attached to that carbon atom 
which possesses lesser number of hydrogen 
atoms. Thus according to this rule, product 
I i.e., 2-bromopropane is expected. In actual 
practice, this is the principal product of the 

 reaction. This generalisation of Markovnikov 
(9.39) rule can be better understood in terms of 

mechanism of the reaction.

Friedrich August Kekulé,a German chemist was born in 1829 at Darmsdt in 
Germany. He became Professor in 1856 and Fellow of Royal Society in 1875. He 
made major contribution to structural organic chemistry by proposing in 1858 that 
carbon atoms can join to one another to form chains and later in 1865,he found 
an answer to the challenging problem of benzene structure by suggesting that 
these chains can close to form rings. He gave the dynamic structural  formula to 
benzene which forms the basis for its modern electronic structure. He described 
the discovery of benzene structure later as:

background. My mental eye, rendered more acute by repeated visions of this 1896)
kind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold  conformations; long 
rows,sometimes more closely fitted together; all twisting and turning in snake like motion. But look! What 
was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of it’s own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my 
eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I woke;.... I spent the rest of the night working out the consequences of 
the hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth but let us 
beware of making our dreams public before they have been approved by the waking mind.”( 1890).
	 One hundred years later, on the occasion of Kekulé’s centenary celebrations a group of compounds 
having polybenzenoid structures have been named as Kekulenes.	

was further found to produce one and only one 
monosubstituted derivative which indicated 
that all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms 
of benzene are identical. On the basis of this 
observation August Kekulé in 1865 proposed 
the following structure for benzene having 
cyclic arrangement of six carbon atoms with

	 However, benzene was found to form only

Resonance and stability of benzene
According to Valence Bond Theory, the 
concept of oscillating double bonds in benzene 
is now explained by resonance. Benzene is a 
hybrid of various resonating structures. The 
two structures, A and B given by Kekulé  are 
the main contributing structures. The hybrid 
structure is represented by inserting a circle 
or a dotted circle in the hexagon as shown 
in (C). The circle represents the six electrons

	 The six π electrons are thus delocalised 
and can move freely about the six carbon 
nuclei, instead of any two as shown in 
Fig. 9.6 (a) or (b). The delocalised π electron cloud 
is attracted more strongly by the nuclei of the 
carbon atoms than the electron cloud localised

SUMMARY

Hydrocarbons are the compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons are mainly 
obtained from coal and petroleum, which are the major sources of energy. Petrochemicals 
are the prominent starting materials used for the manufacture of a large number of 
commercially important products. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and  CNG (compressed 
natural gas), the main sources of energy for domestic fuels and the automobile industry, are 
obtained from petroleum. Hydrocarbons are classified as open chain saturated (alkanes) 
and unsaturated (alkenes and alkynes), cyclic (alicyclic) and aromatic, according to their 
structure. 

The important reactions of alkanes are free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation 
and aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly 
electrophilic additions. Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo 
mainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under 
special conditions. 

Alkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C–C sigma 
bonds. Out of staggered and the eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation 
is more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical 
(cis-trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon–carbon double bond. 

Benzene and benzenoid compounds show aromatic character. Aromaticity, the 
property of being aromatic is possessed by compounds having specific electronic structure 
characterised by Hückel (4n+2)π electron rule. The nature of groups or substituents attached 
to benzene ring is responsible for activation or deactivation of the benzene ring towards 
further electrophilic substitution and also for orientation of the incoming group. Some of 
the polynuclear hydrocarbons having fused benzene ring system have carcinogenic property.
