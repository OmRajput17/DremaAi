Foreword

The Foundational Stage in school education, as envisaged by the 
National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, serves as the cornerstone 
for the holistic development of children. It enables them not only 
to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos 
and constitutional framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and 
numeracy. This foundation equips them to transition seamlessly 
into the more challenging Preparatory Stage.

The Preparatory Stage acts as a bridge between the Foundational 
and the Middle Stages, spanning three years from Grade 3 to Grade 5. 
The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical 
approaches of the Foundational Stage. While the play-way, 
discovery, and activity-based learning methods continue, children 
are also introduced to textbooks and more formal classroom 
settings. This introduction aims not to overwhelm but to establish 
a foundation across  curricular areas, promoting holistic learning 
and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, drawing, 
singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach encompasses 
physical education, art education, environmental education, 
languages, mathematics, basic science, and social science. 
This comprehensive approach ensures children are well-prepared 
both at the cognitive, sensitive, physical, and pranic (emotional) 
levels to effortlessly transition to the Middle Stage.

The textbook, Maths Mela for Grade 5 Mathematics is 
meticulously designed to align with these objectives. It adheres to 
the recommendations of the National Education Policy 2020 and the 
National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023. The 
textbook emphasises conceptual understanding, critical thinking, 
creativity, values, and dispositions essential for this developmental 
stage. It incorporates cross-cutting themes such as inclusion, 
multilingualism, gender equality, and cultural rootedness integrating 
appropriate ICT and school-based assessments. The engaging content 
and activities are designed to captivate students and encourage 
peer group learning, thus enriching the educational experience for 
students as well as teachers.

Prelims__Class 5.indd   3 04-07-2025   03:02:58



It is crucial to remember the pedagogical focus of the textbook 
emphasising understanding, critical thinking, reasoning, and 
decision making. Children’s innate curiosity at this stage should 
be nurtured by addressing their questions and designing activities 
based on core learning principles. While the play-way method 
continues, the nature of toys and games used for teaching evolves to 
enhance engagement rather than mere attraction. 

While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore 
additional resources on the subject. School libraries should facilitate 
this extended learning, and parents and teachers should support 
their endeavours.

An effective learning environment motivates students, keeping 
them engaged and fostering curiosity and wonder vital for learning. 

With confidence, I recommend this textbook to all students 
and teachers at the Preparatory Stage. I extend my gratitude to 
everyone involved in its development, hopeful that it will meet 
expectations. As NCERT remains committed to systemic reforms 
and improving publication quality, we welcome feedback to refine 
the textbook content.

About  the  Book

The textbook Maths Mela for Grade 5, has been developed based on 
the recent documents — National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and 
National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 
2023. They aim to ensure that all children achieve basic numerical 
skills and abilities to think mathematically and logically, solve 
problems, develop intuitions regarding quantities and reasoning, 
and feel a sense of joy, wonder, and curiosity. The Preparatory Stage 
specifically focuses on the development of conceptual ideas about 
numbers, shapes, and spatial relationships, measurement and data 
handling, procedural skills and fluency, and computational thinking.

In light of this, the book for Grade 5 is designed to support 
learners in consolidating their learnings in the Foundational 
Stage and making progress towards dealing with more abstract 
ideas. The chapters of the book cover the foundational ideas of 
Mathematics: whole numbers and operations, fractions, shapes and 
spatial relationships, measurement (length, weight, capacity, time), 
and data handling. Chapters are woven around certain themes so as 
to engage children with the ideas and their applications. Ideas will 
keep recurring throughout the book, building deeper engagement 
and complexity to suit the interest and curiosity of the growing child. 

We firmly believe that young learners are capable of reasoning, 
thinking, and problem-solving in different ways. Therefore, the book 
provides several occasions for identifying and noticing ideas and 
relationships across ideas, giving examples and counter-examples to 
statements, creating objects using mathematical ideas, measuring 
and quantifying, estimating, and solving problems. There are 
also opportunities to hone one’s arithmetic skills through bare 
exercises, games, and puzzles. At some places in the chapters, such 
opportunities have been provided under the section ‘Let us Play’. 
Another important purpose behind games and puzzles is to provide 
learners a stress-free and joyful learning. Most of these need not be 
assessed. Some tasks are aimed towards ‘computational thinking’ 
where learners are expected to observe and articulate patterns and 
find exhaustive solutions and solutions under different constraints.

Prelims__Class 5.indd   5 04-07-2025   03:02:58



We also believe that learners should develop a liking for 
Mathematics. The chapters of this textbook provide several enjoyable 
activities, tasks, games, and puzzles that build on children’s 
intuitions and tap into their experiences in the world around them. 
These have been given under the section ‘Let Us Do’ at many places 
in the chapters. These are sometimes used for making an entry to 
the concept and at other times provide opportunities to consolidate 
the ideas. The narrative in the chapters is supported through vivid 
illustrations, which are also integral to the tasks. We hope that this 
will allow learners to read pictures and use them for developing 
important mathematical ideas. Mathematical vocabulary and 
ways of communicating about mathematics have been emphsised 
throughout the chapters. We continue to provide instructions and 
explanation with as little use of language as possible. 

Mathematics is an integrated body of knowledge, with a 
connected and coherent set of ideas. It can be built logically 
on commonly shared assumptions. Mathematical thinking and 
reasoning are an important part of learning mathematics. The 
book attempts to move away from rote memorisation of rules and 
procedures which kill learners’ curiosity and burden them. It rather 
pushes learners to explore and discover important mathematical 
ideas. The sections named ‘Let Us Think’, ‘Let Us Explore’, and ‘Let 
Us Discuss’, included at various places, aim at keeping learners 
curious to reason out their thinking. These will give them reasons and 
insights that can be used to remember ideas and apply ideas flexibly 
and creatively, making further learning easier. It is important to 
engage with these processes of Mathematics so that learners can go 
beyond routine mathematical problems confidently and without fear 
and anxiety. We hope that the carefully chosen learning activities 
will help them make sense of the ideas, develop capacities to solve 
problems, experience wonder and joy in the process, and be curious 
about the world of mathematics. In addition to all of these, with 
growing capacities of children we have introduced a section called 
“Let Us Solve”. This is aimed to help children hone their skills  of 
using procedures, solving routine problems, and word problems. 

We believe that the time available for children to work on 
problems and share their solutions and ideas will be crucial to 
achieve the objectives of NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023. The book 
carries several suggestions for appropriate activities and experiences 
(in class and in and around the home) to develop mathematical ideas. 

vi

Prelims__Class 5.indd   6 04-07-2025   03:02:58



Teachers’ and parents’ support in changing conditions of learning 
for our children will be very important to achieve the dreams of a 
better and more confident nation.

The book also advises on the making of simple inexpensive 
concrete materials for learners to work with, and to develop and 
communicate their thinking. A few perforated sheets for some of 
the tasks in the chapters are provided at the end of the book. There 
are some more ideas in the ‘Note for the Teachers’ for activities and 
materials. The chapters also show a gradual movement from the use 
of materials to the use of pictures and making schematic diagrams 
to make sense of the situation and identify better strategy.  The 
book tries to build models for the ideas using materials and pictures 
so that learners can use them to develop independent thinking. 
We would sincerely urge teachers and parents to use the sequence 
of ideas suggested in the book for teaching and gradually arrive at 
more formal rules and procedures. When children develop a better 
understanding, they will be in a better position to appreciate the 
rules and procedures. Similar care is also to be taken by parents 
and elder siblings who may help their wards in learning through 
this book. ‘Note for the Teachers’ may help teachers and parents in 
appropriately enhancing the child’s learning.

Several activities and tasks in the book also require that children 
talk and discuss their ideas. Learning will significantly improve in a 
classroom that welcomes and respects learners’ ideas. They will see 
different ways of thinking and using ideas, and alternative solutions 
leading to better and independent solutions over a period of time. 
They will get opportunities to scrutinise each other’s solutions 
and develop fluency with mathematical language, symbols, and 
procedures. These will also serve as good assessments of learning 
for the teacher and also provide feedback to them. The exercises 
given in the book are also examples of how learners can be assessed.

Assessment should be done in multiple forms — using materials 
and pictures, problem situations and bare problems, activities, 
creating objects, and sharing and explaining solutions. The book 
provides enough opportunities for adaptive assessment, assessment 
for learning, and assessment as learning while the child is engaged 
in different activities. Teachers can note down their observations 
while the learners discuss their ideas, replying to the questions 
asked, and explaining the reasoning for their answer. Such records 
can be included in the learner’s portfolio.

Prelims__Class 5.indd   7 04-07-2025   03:02:58



Chapters have more paper and pen tasks in Grade 5 (questions, word problems, 
and projects) that a child can complete in the classroom or at home. Such tasks 
provide opportunities to practice writing and present their thinking on paper. 

In the times to come, we will provide more resources to the teachers 
and learners in the form of videos, worksheets for practice, and links to 
online resources.

We hope that the book will be enjoyable to all and will lead to better 
teaching-learning conditions.

you  a r e  i n  doubt  o r  when  the  s e l f
becomes too much with you, apply the
following test:

Recall the face of the poorest and
the weakest man whom you may have
seen and ask yourself if the step you
contemplate is going to be of any use
to him. Will he gain anything by it?
Will it restore him to a control over
h i s  own l i f e  and  des t iny?  In  other
words, will it lead to Swaraj for the

Chapter

1 We the 
Travellers —  I

When was the last time you went on a long trip? Where did you go? How did 
you travel? What was the duration of your trip? How much distance did you 
cover? Ask the elders who went with you to help you answer these questions.

Human beings have always been 
interested in travelling. About a hundred 
years ago, there were far fewer vehicles 
than today. There were animal-drawn 
carts, cars, and trains. Long before this, 
thousands of years ago, people travelled 
long distances on foot or used animals 
to travel from one place to another. 
They also built boats and ships to travel 
across lakes, rivers, and seas. Boats were 
probably the first form of transport invented by humans, much before bullock 
carts! Do you know how many vehicles are currently there in your state?
Reading and writing large numbers
How do you write numbers to show several thousand objects?
Let us start with 1,000. What numbers do we get when we keep adding a 
thousand?

1,000 2,000 9,000

What number do we get when we add a thousand to 9,000? We get ten 
thousand. How do we write this number?

Chapter-1 We the Travellers-1.indd   1 7/2/2025   3:29:58 PM



Look at the table below and notice the pattern of writing numbers. In the place 
value chart, we have added another column, TTh. It stands for ten thousand.

×10 ×10 ×10 ×10
1 10 Ones = 1 Ten = 10

TTh Th H T O

1

1 0

1 0 0

1 0 0 0 10 Tens = 1 Hundred 
  = 100 10 Hundreds = 1 Thousand

1 0 0 0 0
           = 1,000

In the same way,  10 Thousands = Ten Thousand = 10,000
We use a comma to 
help us read large 

1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 numbers easily
10,000

1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000

Do you remember how we read and write numbers in the Indian place 
value system? We use the same ten digits 0–9 in different places to write 
larger numbers. 
For example,
1,380 = 1 Thousand + 3 Hundreds + 8 Tens + 0 Ones.

1,000 100 100 10 10 10 10

100 10 10 10 10

9,123 = 9 Thousands + 1 Hundred + 2 Tens + 3 Ones.

Travelling, Now and Then 

We learnt that people in the past travelled on foot, on animals, and used boats 
and sailing ships. The animals that have been used for travelling include 
bullocks, horses, donkeys, mules, and elephants. In hilly and snow-covered 
regions, yaks, dogs, and reindeers have been used, while camels have been 
used in deserts.
Now, people use bicycles, motorbikes, cars, buses, trains, ships, and aeroplanes 
to travel from one place to another. Submarines are used to go deep under 
water. Humans are also using spacecraft to travel to outer space.

Pastime Mathematics

Sanju and Mira are traveling on a train. To pass time, they challenge each 
other with games and puzzles.
1.	 Mira poses the river 

crossing puzzle to Sanju.
A boatman wants to cross a river 
in a boat. He has to take a lion, 
a sheep, and a bundle of grass 
with him. He can take one of 
them at a time. If the sheep and 
grass are left on the shore, the 
sheep will eat the grass. And, if 
the sheep and lion are left on the 
shore, the lion will eat the sheep.
How can the boatman take the lion, sheep, and grass across the river?
Help him so that he can ferry the lion, sheep, and grass across the river 
safely, and in the minimum number of trips.

Chapter-1 We the Travellers-1.indd   11 7/2/2025   3:29:59 PM



2.	 Sanju introduces a game called pile of 
pebbles to Mira.

There are two piles of pebbles. Each pile contains 
7 pebbles. Each player can pick as many pebbles 
they want from either of the piles. The player who 
picks the last pebble wins.
Try this game with your friends. Now, how do you 
play so that you win?
To find a winning strategy, try playing with 1 pebble in each pile, two in each, 
three in each, and so on.
3.	 Now, it’s Mira’s turn. She gives a fun puzzle to Sanju with the following 

steps —
									               For example

(a)	 Take any two different digits. 3 and 7
(b)	 Make two 2-digit numbers 37 and 73

using them.
(c)	 Subtract the smaller number	

from the bigger number. 73 – 37 = 36
Now, use the two digits in the difference and repeat steps (b) and (c).
Continue this process until you get a 1-digit number. Even before everyone 
could finish, Mira exclaimed, “Mind you! No matter which two numbers you 
choose, you will get 9 in the end.”
The whole process will look as shown below.

7 3 6 3 7 2 5 4
-- 3 7 -- 3 6 -- 2 7 -- 4 5

3 6 2 7 4 5    9
How did Mira know what the 1-digit number in the end would be?
Let us explore.

(1)	 Observe the differences you get in each step above. Do you notice 
anything in common?

(2)	 Try the puzzle using any other pair of digits. What is common to 
these differences? What do you get in the end?

(3)	 What digits can you choose so that you get a 1-digit number in the 
first step itself? Give some examples. Describe the pattern in the 
digits.

Note for Teachers: Encourage the students to think logically and strategically while 
solving these puzzles. Such thinking underlies all of mathematics.

12

Chapter-1 We the Travellers-1.indd   12 7/2/2025   3:29:59 PM



(4)	 Now, find different digits such that the difference between the 
numbers is 27.

(5)	 Mira found an interesting relationship between the two digits and 
the difference obtained. Can you see it in the table that Mira made?

Digits Differences in digits Difference in numbers 
formed by the digits

3, 7 7 – 3 = 4 73 – 37 = 36

1, 9 9 – 1 = 8 91 – 19 = 72

2, 8 8 – 2 = 6 82 – 28 = 54

4, 5 5 – 4 = 1 54 – 45 = 9

Extend this table by choosing appropriate digits so that the resulting differences 
are 2, 3, 5, and 7 respectively.
What do the differences between the digits indicate?
List the numbers that give a 1-digit number in the third subtraction.
Identify pairs of digits that lead to the 1-digit number after the maximum 
possible number of subtractions. Compare your answers with your friends.

King’s Horses  

Once upon a time, there was a king who was 
very fond of horses. He had 20 horses of the 
best breed. The horses were kept in the royal 
stable, and cared for by a caretaker.
One night, a thief stole one of the horses. Fearing 
punishment, the caretaker arranged the horses 
in the stable as shown in the picture here.
The next day, when the king came to check 
on the horses, the caretaker led him around 
the square stable. “Please count the number of 
horses along each side, your majesty,” he said. The dots above show how the 

horses were arranged in the stable.

15

Chapter 1.indd   15 05-07-2025   15:01:04



The king counted 5 horses along each side. “We have 5 horses along each side 
and there are 4 sides. So there are a total of 20 horses, your majesty,” the 
caretaker explained.
Satisfied with the explanation, the king returned to his palace.
But wait, were there really 20 horses in the stable? Count the horses one by 
one and check! What was the mistake in the caretaker’s explanation?
The following night, the thief stole another horse from the stable. Now, only 18 
horses remained. The caretaker once again cleverly arranged the 18 horses, 
so that there were 5 horses on each side of the square stable. How do you 
think he was able to do it? Arrange the 18 horses in the stable with 5 on each 
side.

How many more horses can the thief steal before the king notices something 
is wrong? Try making the arrangements yourself.

3 Angles as Turns

Can you recognise the child in the picture who has made a full turn? Who 
has made a half turn? How do you know? Discuss in class.

Let us play “Statue”. 
Keep turning around ... STATUE!

A B C D A B C D

Give examples of real-life situations where you observe turns.

Ashutosh and Sahana are making circles, 
each having one foot fixed and rotating at 
one spot on the ground.
Ashutosh made a complete circle by 
making a full turn. Sahana is making a 
half-moon shape with a half turn.

The minute hand makes a full turn 
when it comes back to the initial 
position.

Note for Teachers: Encourage the learners to play the “statue” game. Learners can 
be asked to rotate themselves around and stop as the teacher announces “statue”. 
The learners can notice how much they have turned with respect to their original 
position.

Paste these parts on a thicker paper or 
board and you can use them as angle 
measuring tools.

Note for Teachers: Help the learners to make the angle measuring tools using 
tracing paper. Use these for measuring various angles. Let them mark the starting 
point. Also, help them fix a straw at the centre and measure the turns with respect 
to the starting point.

Making Sums Equal 

In each of the following, there are two groups of numbers. Look carefully at 
the numbers in each group and their sums. Interchange pairs of numbers 
between the two groups to make their sums equal. Try to do this using the 
least number of moves. You could write each number on a small piece of paper. 

Think what will happen to the sums if we interchange 2 and 5? Try 
interchanging other pairs of numbers and find the one that will make

Fuel Arithmetic 

Different vehicles need different quantities of fuel. This quantity can vary 
from 5 to 15 litres in the case of motorbikes, 15 to 50 litres in the case of cars, 
150 to 500 litres in the case of lorries and trucks, and 5,000 litres in the case 
of a train.
Remember — We must save fuel as it is a limited resource. Reducing fuel usage 
also helps in cutting down pollution. Electric vehicles are now available that help 
conserve natural fuel and reduce pollution.

The Longest Land Route — Adding Large Numbers                      
The longest distance one can 
travel by road is between Talon 
(in Russia) and Sagres (in 
Portugal). It is 15,150 km long. SRINAGAR

In 2019, the North–South 
Corridor was the longest land 1885 km
route within India, starting 
from Srinagar in Jammu 
and Kashmir and ending 
at Kanniyakumari in Tamil 
Nadu. Do you know how long A

it was? Let us find out.
One of the places on the 
North–South Corridor was 1862 km
1,855 km from Srinagar and 
1,862 km from Kanniyakumari.

The World of Small Things
How can we measure small things like the 
ones shown here? sprout small screws nail

Let us look at the scale. Do you notice the small marks between 1 cm and 
2 cm? Count how many marks are there between 1 cm and 2 cm?

1 2 3 4 5 6 7

One centimetre is divided into ten equal parts. Each part is called 
1 millimetre (mm).

1 cm = 10 mm 1 cm = 10 mm
These small marks between any two centimetre marks help us measure the 
smaller lengths. Thus, it adds to the precision in measurement.

Let Us Measure

Soak some seeds of whole moong or black or white chana overnight. Next 
morning, take them out and wrap them in a moist cloth to sprout them. 
Over the next 4 days, take out one seed each day and measure the length of 
sprout. For ease of measurement, you can either place the seed on a paper 
and mark the length of the sprout, or use a thread to find its length.

Adding and Subtracting Lengths 

Saji saw on his smartphone that he walked 3 km 450 m in the morning 
and another 4 km 650 m in the evening. How much did he walk in the 
whole day? How would you solve this problem? Share your thoughts in class.

Electricians are changing the cables in a house. They need 63 m of cable
for this purpose. They used 16 m 75 cm cable in the first room.
What is the length of the cable left?

Convert 1 m = 100 cm

Convert the quantities in cm. 5 12 9 10

6,300 cm – 1,675 cm 6 3 0 0
-- 1 6 7 5

4 6 2 5

4625 cm = 4600 cm + 25 cm = 46 m 25 cm.

We can also subtract like units, as above.

Therefore, 46 m 25 cm cable is left.

Note for the Teachers: Lengths can be added and subtracted in different ways. 
We can orally calculate whenever the numbers are convenient, like 200, 250, 400, 
500, or 750, etc. In fact, we should encourage the use of mental strategies so that 
students can use mathematics for solving daily-life problems. When numbers are not 
suitable for oral calculations, the learners can choose one of the column strategies 
provided here based on their comfort. Help learners notice the similarity between 
operations on numbers and on quantities like length.

Is this true for the product of any two numbers? Discuss in class.

The number of groups and the group size are interchanged in each case 
above, but the total number of butter packets remain the same.

  Patterns in Multiplication by 10s and 100s           
1.	 Let us revise multiplication by 10s and 100s.

a) 4 × 10 = _____	 d) 10 × 10 = 100	 g) 3 × 100 = 100 × 3 = 300
b) 20 × 10 = _____	 e) 20 × 50 = ______	 h) 8 × 100 = _____ = ______
c) 10 × 40 = _____	 f) 80 × 10 = ______	 i) 10 × 100 = _____ = ______

Note for Teachers: Encourage the learners to understand that when we multiply a 
number by 10, it becomes 10 times, and each digit moves one place value to the left. 
Multiplying by 100 makes the number 100 times larger, shifting each digit two place 
value to the left. Let them notice the pattern of zeros in the place value table.

  Many Ways to Multiply 
Do you think they are 

all correct? Why do 
What is     1  8      × 5 you think so?

Half of 18 is 9. 9×5 is 45 and 9×5 is 45. 
I added 45 and 45 together to get 90.

First, I doubled 18 to get 36. Then I doubled 36 to get 72 
and then I added 18 to 72 to get 90.

I separated 18 into 8 and 10. 8×5 is 40. 10×5 is 50. 
then I added 40 and 50 together to get 90.

18×5 = 9×10. So, 90.

I did 20×5, which is 100. Then I took away 2×5, 
which is 10. So, 100 –10 = 90.

  ------------ The family produces _____ kg of waste in 
  420 a year.

How are these solutions same or different? Discuss in class.
2.	 The family regularly composts the collected waste. They get around 

150 kg of compost each year, which they use in their garden. 1 kg 
of compost is often sold in the market at ₹24. By creating their own 
compost, how much money have they saved in a year?

	 Savings on 1 kg compost is ₹24. Savings on 150 kg will be ₹24 × 150.

  Dairy Cooperative 
1.	 A dairy cooperative in a small town 

gets its milk from 268 villagers. Each 
villager has at least 4 milk-giving 
cows. What is the minimum number 
of cows the dairy cooperative gets its 
milk from?

	 1 villager has at least 4 milk-giving 
cows. 268 villagers will have at least 
268 × 4 cows.

                         268 (200 + 60 + 8) Remember!
                         ×  4
   ----------------------------------- 4 × 6 Tens = 24 Tens = 240

           800 + 240 + 32 = 1,072  4 × 2 Hundreds = 8  Hundreds = 800

30 is added to 4 × 60 = 240
200 is added to 4×200 = 800

30 from 32 is added to 4×60, not to 60

has taught her to use 

place values of digits to 2 3

Discuss how this multiplication is being carried out! 1 0 2  7 3  2

The dairy cooperative gets milk from a minimum of 1,072 cows.

Many women dairy entreprenuers are playing significant role in the dairy sector. 
Jamanaben Maganbhai Naku of village Tuked in Surat possesses 27 Gir cows and 
rears the cows through Low-cost Farm Investment.

Note for Teachers: The algorithm for multiplication is challenging for learners to 
understand. While learners should surely be able to multiply large numbers using 
the ways they have learnt till now, this last step (Mili’s father’s method) need not be 
over-emphasised. Please support them if your students are ready for this. Otherwise, 
it is perfectly fine if learners can carry out multiplication of large numbers using 
John’s methods.

2.	 The villagers rear various breeds of cows. 
Gir is an Indian cow breed from Gujarat, 
with a high milk-producing capacity. Among 
the villagers, there are 453 Gir cows. Each 
of these cows give 13 litres of milk each 
day. How many litres of milk does the dairy 
cooperative receive from Gir cows everyday?

	 One Gir cow produces 13 litres of milk. 
453 Gir cows will produce, 453 × 13 litres 
of milk. 

100 is added to
3 × 400 = 1200

                        453 (400 + 50 + 3)
                      ×  13 (10 + 3)
   ---------------------------------
      1200 + 150 +   9	= 1359 (3 × 453) 3 × 5 T = 15 T = 150
    4000 + 500 + 30	= 4530 (10 × 453) 3 × 4 H = 12 H = 1,200

Note for Teachers: The learners’ attention needs to be drawn continuously to the 
place values of numbers and their products. Draw similarities with the steps between 
the different methods. Remind them to put appropriate zeros when multiplying by 
10s and 100s.

3.	 The dairy cooperative sells 1 kg cow ghee for ₹574. 
The cooperative is able to produce around 125 kg of 
ghee in a month. How much do they earn by selling 
ghee in a month? Discuss what the

  The King’s Reward 

One day, a king decided to reward three of his most talented ministers. The 
king called them to his court and said, “You all have served my empire with 
great dedication. As a reward, I give you three choices of gold.

88

Chapter-6 The Dairy Farm.indd   88 7/2/2025   3:34:43 PM



Choose wisely!
Choice 1: Take 5 gold coins and double the number of coins every day for 
7 days.
Choice 2: Take 3 gold coins and triple the number of coins every day for 7 
days.
Choice 3: Take 1 gold coin and multiply the number of coins by 5 every day 
for 7 days.
Minister 1 — I will take 5 gold coins and double the number of coins every 
day for 7 days.
Minister 2 — I will take 3 gold coins and triple the number of coins every 
day for 7 days.
Minister 3 — I will take 1 gold coin and multiply the number of coins by 5 
every day for 7 days.
The King gave 5 coins to Minister 1, 3 coins to Minister 2 and 1 coin to 
Minister 3.
Which of the rewards would you have chosen?
After a week, the 3 ministers were surprised at the final amount of gold 
coins. Guess who received the most gold coins? Calculate how much gold 
coins each minister received.

Weaving Mats

You may have seen woven baskets 
of different kinds. If  you look closely, 
you will notice different weaving 
patterns on each basket.
We will try weaving some mats with 
paper strips.
1.	 Let us make paper mats.
You will need — A coloured paper (30 cm long 
and 20 cm wide) and eight paper strips of 
two different colours (3 cm wide and longer 
than 20 cm). 
(a)	 Take a coloured paper 30 cm long and 

20 cm wide.
(b)	 Fold the coloured paper in half along the 

longer side.
(c)	 Draw vertical lines at equal distances from the closed 

end and cut slits leaving a gap of 3 cm at the top.
(d)	 Carefully unfold the paper. There will be no cuts in the 

paper at the top and the bottom.
(e)	 Now cut 8 paper strips of 3 cm width in 2 colours and 

of length slightly longer than 20 cm.
(f)	 Take one colour strip and weave it across the slits going 

1 under and 1 over, and again 1 under and 1 over. 
Repeat it for the first row.

(g)	 Take one more strip of another colour and weave it 
across the slits going 1 over and 1 under, and again 
1 over and 1 under. Repeat it for the second row.

(h)	Weave all the strips in the same alternating pattern. 
Neatly fold any extra strip ends behind the mat. 
Your mat is ready!

We can describe the pattern of the above weave as follows.
Row 1 — 1 under, 1 over, 1 under, 1 over, … (repeat)
Row 2 — 1 over, 1 under, 1 over, 1 under, … (repeat)

Chapter-7 Shapes and Patterns.indd   92 7/2/2025   3:35:10 PM



2.	 Can you figure out how to make this mat?
Let us try to understand how this mat is woven by looking 
at the pattern in the first two rows.
Row 1 — 2 over, 1 under, 2 over, 1 under, ...
Row 2 — 2 under, 1 over, 2 under, 1 over, …
You can use strips of the same colour or 2 different 
colours, one for each row.
3.	 Try to weave a pattern, using the rules given below.

Row 1 — 2 over, 1 under, 2 over, 1 under, ... (repeat).
Row 2 — 1 under (do not repeat), 3 over, 3 under, 3 over,  

3 under, ... (repeat).
Row 3 — 2 under, 1 over, 2 under, ... (repeat).
Row 4 — 1 over (do not repeat), 3 under, 3 over ... (repeat). 

Continue weaving in this order.

4.	 Can you work out the steps 
for any of these designs and 
weave the pattern? 

Write the steps of the pattern 
in your notebook for each row 
until it starts repeating.

Let Us Try
Draw the following pattern on a grid 
paper. Part of it is done for you. 
Now, complete 
the rest of the 
grid to get the 
full design.

Tiling and Tessellation

We often use tiles of the same shape or a combination of shapes to cover 
a region.
You can see pentagons (5-sided figures) in this figure. 
As all its sides are equal it is a regular pentagon.
Shapes that have equal sides are called regular shapes.
We have placed 3 pentagons around a point. Can we fit 
one more into the empty space? 
Pentagons cannot fill a region without leaving gaps. So, 
we say that regular pentagons do not tessellate.

Find Out

Can regular triangles fit together at a point without any gap? How many 
of them fit together? (A sample triangle is given at the end of the book).
Do you see that regular triangles fit around a point as 
shown here? 
Regular triangles when fitted around a point leave 
no gaps and there is no overlap.
Triangles with all equal sides are also called equilateral 
triangles. 
Therefore, equilateral triangles tessellate. Can squares 
(a regular 4-sided shape) fit together around a point without 
any gap or overlap? Try it out using cutouts of squares (a sample square is 
given at the end of the book). How many squares did you need?

Can five squares fit together around a point without any gaps or overlaps? 
Why or why not?

Can regular hexagons (6-sided shapes with equal sides) fit 
together around a point without any gaps or overlaps? Try 
and see (a sample hexagon is given at the end of the book). 
How many fit together at a point?

94

Chapter 7.indd   94 05-07-2025   16:03:08



Here is a tessellating pattern with more than one shape.
What shapes have been used in this pattern? _____________, _____________.

Continue the pattern given below and colour it appropriately.

A regular octagon means a shape with eight 
equal sides.
Do regular octagons fit together without any gaps or 
overlaps? Try drawing the same and check.
Regular octagons do not tessellate.

marked points? Are the same set of shapes coming together at these points? 
Continue the pattern and colour it appropriately.

Here is a tiling pattern made using two different shapes — squares and 
triangles. Are the triangles equilateral? Why or why not?

What shapes are coming together at the marked points?
Are the same set of shapes coming together at these points? 
Continue the pattern and colour it appropriately.
Create similar patterns using other cutouts of shapes.
A rhombus is a shape with all equal sides. It has been divided 
into four triangles.

You will find a copy of this rhombus at the end of the book. Cut out the 
triangular pieces for the following activities.
What geometrical shapes can you make by fitting 2 of these triangles 
together? Trace the shapes you created.

1.	 How many different types of triangles can you make?
	 Now, observe and measure the sides of these triangles. What do you 

notice?
Each triangle has 2 equal sides. Such triangles are called isosceles triangles.
Trace the isosceles triangles on a paper and cut them out. Fold them in 
half. What do you notice about their angles?

Each isosceles triangle has 2 equal angles.
2.	 Is it possible to make a triangle where all three sides are equal 

(equilateral triangle)?
3.	 Is it possible to make a triangle where all three sides are unequal?

Try This

Cut the equilateral triangle provided at the end of the book. Check if all 
the angles of an equilateral triangle are equal—just like you did with the 
isosceles triangle.

Equilateral triangles have equal angles.

Now, cut the equilateral triangle in half. How many  
sides of each new triangle are equal?
Triangles that have no equal sides 
are called scalene triangles. 
Check in scalene triangles whether any two or more angles are equal?

Note for Teachers: Encourage the learners to use paper folding methods to compare 
the angles of a shape.

Chapter-7 Shapes and Patterns.indd   97 04-07-2025   12:06:39



4.	 How many different 4-sided shapes (quadrilaterals) can you make? 
Here are three possible shapes.

Have you made a shape like the one shown on 
the right? 1 2
This shape is called a kite.
What do you notice about the sides of a kite?
Side 1 = Side 2.
Similarly, Side 3 = Side 4. 4 3
These sides are called adjacent sides.
Here are two other possible quadrilaterals that are not kites.

A B

5.	 Measure the sides of each of these two quadrilaterals A and B. What do 
you notice?

	 A re there any pairs of sides that are equal? Which pairs are equal—
adjacent or opposite?

Quadrilaterals whose opposite sides are equal are called parallelograms.
What types of angles do quadrilaterals A and B have? Which angles are 
equal in each of the above parallelograms?
In parallelogram A, opposite angles are equal.
In parallelogram B, all angles are equal and are right angles. Such a
parallelogram is called a rectangle. 
A rectangle is a special type of parallelogram.

98

Chapter 7.indd   98 05-07-2025   15:05:46



6.	 In the grid given below, draw two different kites and parallelograms each.

7.	 Now, use 3 triangles from the rhombus to form shapes. How many 
sides do each one of them have?

Using 3 triangular pieces of the rhombus, try creating a (a) 3-sided shape, 
(b) 4-sided shape, and (c) 5-sided shape.
8.	 Which of these shapes can be made with all 4 pieces? Try and find out.

(a) Square (d) Pentagon (5-sided)
(b) Rectangle (e) Hexagon (6-sided)
(c) Triangle (f) Octagon (8-sided)

Tangram

Look at the tangram set given at the end of your textbook. 
Cut out all the shapes. Name them.
(a)	 How are they same or different from each other?
(b)	 What do you notice about the angles of each of the 

shapes?
(c)	 What do you notice about the sides of each of the shapes?

Now, use some or all of the pieces of your tangram set to make the following 
shapes. There may be more than one way to do it.

The Grocery Store

Rathna went to the local grocery store and bought several items. 
She bought 2 kg 500 g rice for daily use and 1 kg 750 g additional rice for 
the upcoming Pongal festival. How much total rice did she buy?

I can think like this kg g We can add 
2 kg 500 g + 1 kg 750 g 1 and
= 3 kg + 500 g + 750 g. subtract like 

500 g + 750 g 2 5 0 0 quantities.
= 500 g + 500 g + 250 g 

= 1 kg + 250 g + 1 7 5 0
So, total rice bought is 4 kg 

250. 4 1 2 5 0

1 Grams 1,000 g = 1 kg
2 5 0 0 We can also convert 

the quantities into grams.
+ 1 7 5 0 2,500 g + 1,750 g

4 1 2 5 0 = 4 kg 250 g

How much extra rice did she buy for household use than for the Pongal 
festival? 

Note for Teachers: Please note that three different ways have been suggested above 
for adding and subtracting weights. The need for these different strategies arises 
depending on the numbers used. If the numbers are 250, 500, 750 or even 200, 400, 
500, etc., we can add and subtract numbers orally. In fact, we should encourage 
these mental strategies to be able to use mathematics for daily life problem-solving. 
When numbers are not amenable to such oral calculations, the learners can choose 
one of the column strategies provided here, based on their comfort. Help learners 
observe the similarity between subtraction of numbers and subtraction of quantities 
like weights.

More Operations on Weight

1.	 A farmer weighs a sack of potatoes and finds it to be 10 kg 500 g. 
If the farmer has 4 such potato sacks, what is the total weight of all 
the sacks?

4 × 10 kg 500 g  You can find the product by 
= 4 ×10 kg and 4 × 500 g multiplying the kg and g separately 
= 40 kg + 2000 g and adding the two. You can also 
= 40 kg + 2 kg = 42 kg. convert the quantity into grams and 

then multiply.

2.	 A box of nuts weighing 4 kg 800 g is equally distributed into 4 smaller 
boxes. What is the weight of each small box in grams?

4 kg ÷ 4 = 1 kg
800 g ÷ 4 =  200 g We can also convert the 

quantity into grams and 
So, 4 kg 800 g ÷ 4 = 1 kg 200 g divide

4800 ÷ 4 = ?

Mental Strategies for Division                      
I can do it in a  
different way.

Observe the division carefully.

I can split the number 2. 1992 ÷ 4
into convenient parts. 1992 = 2000 – 8

2000 ÷ 4 = 500
1. 1248 ÷ 6 8 ÷ 4 = 2

1248 = 1200 + 48 So, 1992 ÷ 4 = 500 – 2 = 498.
I know 1200 ÷ 6 = 200
and 48 ÷ 6 = 8
So, 1248 ÷ 6 = 200 + 8 = 208. Can you give 5 such examples where 

you can split the number conveniently?

For which other divisors and dividend might 3. 128 ÷ 4
this strategy of repeated halving work? To divide by 4, I can halve twice.

? Half of 128 is 64.

Sometimes, the divisor (D) does not completely divide the dividend (N) and
leaves a remainder (R). What is the relationship between the dividend (N) 
and divisor (D), quotient (Q), and remainder (R)? Try to find out!
Is 726 = 4 × 181? Yes/No. So, 726 = 4 × 181 + ________.
Is 902 = 16 × 56? Yes/No. So, 902 = 16 × 56 + ________. N = D × Q + R

Note for Teachers: Encourage the learners to divide using partial quotients and 
work like Susie. But we may also push them to choose a more optimal strategy 
(like Sunitha’s) by choosing the multiplier or quotient more carefully to reduce the 
number of steps. This will help us reach closer to the standard algorithm.

Can you tell just by looking at the divisor and dividend, how many digits the quotient 
would have? Look at the problems above and find this out. Explain your thoughts.

Note for Teachers: Place-value based division is commonly used by adults. Learners 
often struggle with long division, especially correctly placing zeros at different positions 
of the quotient. Encourage students to use place-value based division, but if they 
find it difficult, they can use the partial quotients method instead which reduces the 
chances of errors.

Alphabet Cutout

Prem and Manu want to paste ‘Happy Birthday’ cutouts on a wall for Lali’s 
birthday. While preparing cutouts of letters, they observe that some letters 
can be cut out in an easy way. 
They remember that they learnt about reflection symmetry and lines of 
symmetry in Grade 4. They used their knowledge of lines of symmetry to 
make the cutouts. The letter A has a vertical line of symmetry. So, to cut 
out the letter ‘A’— Step 1 Step 2

1.	 Fold a paper in half.
2.	 Draw half of the letter A along the fold.
3.	 Cut along the outline.
4.	 Open the paper to see the full letter A. Step 3 Step 4

The letter H has two lines of symmetry.
Step 1 Step 2

1.	 Fold the paper into one-fourth (once 
vertically, once horizontally).

2.	 Draw one-fourth of the letter H along the 
fold.

3.	 Cut along the outline. Step 3 Step 4

4.	 Open the paper to see the full letter H.

Which of the following alphabet cutouts can be made by just drawing half (12 ) 
or quarter (14 ) of the letter? You can do it by drawing lines of symmetry on 
the letters.

E  N  X  T  K  V  O
Which of the letters have a horizontal line of symmetry? _________________
Which of the letters have a vertical line of symmetry? ____________________
Which letters have both vertical and horizontal lines of symmetry?________

Let Us Do
Use lines of symmetry to make paper cutouts of diya, boat, and other 
designs. Look along the border of the page to find the pictures.

Let Us Make a Windmill Firki

Lali makes firkis for her friends. Follow the steps given below to make your 
own firki.

1.	 Take a square paper.
2.	 Fold the paper in half diagonally to make two triangles.
3.	 Open and fold it the other way to make two more triangles.
4.	 Open it again. You will see an ‘X’ shape on the paper.
5.	 Use scissors to cut along the four lines of the ‘X’. Stop cutting  

about halfway to the centre.
6.	 Take one corner of each triangle and fold it gently towards the  

centre of the paper. Do not press it flat.
7.	 Fold every other corner towards the centre.
8.	 Push a pin through the folded corners and the centre of the  

paper.
9.	 Push the pin through a stick or straw.

Make sure the pin is not too tight.
Check if your windmill spins when the wind is blowing.

Making Designs

(a)	 Does the design have rotational symmetry? 
Yes/No.

(b)	 Try to change the design by adding some 
shape(s) so that the new design looks the 
same after a 1

2  turn. Draw the new design in 
your notebook.

(c)	 Now try to modify or add more shapes so that the new design looks the 
same after 1

4  turn. Draw the new design in your notebook.
(d)	 Do the new designs have reflection symmetry? If yes, draw the lines of 

symmetry.

Let Us Think

Does this design look the same after 12  turn? __________
Does the design look the same after 14 turn?__________

Colour the square given in the adjoining figure using 
two colours so that the design looks the same after 
every 14 turn.
How many times does this shape look the same during 
a full turn?

Do these designs have reflection symmetry also? Draw the line(s) of 
symmetry.

Let Us Do
Cut out squares and equilateral 
triangles with the same side 
length. These are provided at the 
end of the book. 
Make different symmetrical 
designs by using these two shapes.

139

Chapter-10 Symmetrical Design.indd   139 7/2/2025   6:31:15 PM



Does this shape have reflection symmetry? 
If yes, draw its line(s) of symmetry. 
Does it have rotational symmetry? 
If yes, at which turn? 
Does it have both symmetries?

Now, make your designs. Sort your designs in 3 categories — designs with 
only rotational symmetry, designs with only reflection symmetry, and 
designs with both rotational and reflection symmetry.

Let Us Explore

Block printing is a traditional craft of  Wooden Block Print

Rajasthan, known for beautiful patterns and 
bright colours. 
Artisans use carved wooden blocks to print 
designs on fabric. 
This art has been practised for centuries and 
makes Rajasthan’s textiles special.
Below are images of wooden blocks and a part of their prints. Match each 
block to its correct print by drawing a line. One is done for you.

Chapter Grandmother’s  
11 Quilt

Preetha and Adrit’s grandmother made a quilt cover using old clothes. 
Now she wants to decorate it with lace. Tick the lace option that would cover 
the entire border of the quilt.

(i) Red lace  
40 units

(ii) Green lace 
50 units

(iii) Blue lace  
    25 units

She decides to use two different coloured laces. How much lace of each kind 
will be needed to cover the entire border?
Recall that the length of the border of a shape is called its perimeter.

Let Us Do

1.	 Find the perimeter of the following shapes. All sides of the following 
shapes are equal. 

5 cm
4 cm

2.	 Draw two rectangles each having the following perimeters.
(a)	 26 cm (b)	 18 cm		

Chapter-11 Grandmother's Quit.indd   142 7/2/2025   6:18:33 PM



Preetha and Adrit’s grandmother is making a rug with square patches. 
The picture below shows the rug. How many patches have they used to 
make this?

Preetha and Adrit are trying to cover their table with different shapes. 
Preetha covered it with triangles and circles. Adrit covered with squares 
and rectangles.

        Table 1		    	   Table 2		           Table 3			  Table 4
They found that __________, __________ and __________ shapes cover the top 
of the table without gaps and overlaps. __________ shape leaves gaps.
__________ triangles cover Table 1.
__________ squares cover Table 3.
__________ rectangles cover Table 4.
The region covered by the triangles, squares or rectangles is called the area 
of the table.
To find the area of a region, we usually fill it with shapes that tile (no gaps 
and overlaps), like squares, rectangles and triangles.
Do circles tile? Can we use them to cover a region?
The area of Table 1 is __________ triangle units. 
The area of Table 3 is __________ square units.
The area of Table 4 is __________  rectangle units.
Now, try to cover the top of your table without gaps and overlaps with the 
following objects of same size.
	 (a)	Notebooks	 (b)	 Lunch boxes
	 (c)	Pencil boxes	 (d)	 Maths textbooks
Which of the above objects covered the region completely?

143

Preetha is playing with tiles. She covers her desk with different shapes as 
shown below.
Look at the different tiles on her desk and answer how many of the following 
shapes will cover the desk.
(a)	 Green triangles __________
(b)	 Red triangles __________
(c)	 Blue squares __________

Comparing Shapes

Chapter-11 Grandmother's Quit.indd   144 7/2/2025   6:18:34 PM



Which of the above rectangles has the largest area? Trace these shapes 
on to a paper and cut them to find out the one that has the largest area.
Do you see that the area of rectangle A is larger than that of B? What about 
B and C?
Which shape has a larger area among A and C? How will you find out?
Let us put these rectangles on a square grid. Now, can you identify the 
rectangle that has the largest area?
Using square grids is the most convenient way to find the area of regions. 
We say that the area of a square with sides 1 unit is 1 unit square.

1 unit Area = 1 unit square

Let Us Do

1.	 Compare the areas of the two gardens given below on the square grid. 
 Share your observations. 
1 cm

Garden B
Area of Garden A = _____ cm square
Area of Garden B = _____ cm square

Garden A

Note for Teachers: Tiles of several shapes like triangles, rectangles, and squares can 
be used to measure the area of a region. We choose a square as a unit for measuring 
area as its sides are of equal length. Therefore, we can define the area of a unit square 
as 1 unit square. This allows us to measure area, similar to that of measuring length.

Preetha and Adrit’s grandmother is making another square patchwork. 
She arranges the patches as shown below. Can you guess how many patches 
she will need? How did you find it?

We don’t need to 
count them all. Look! 
There are 6 rows of 4 
patches each. That is 
6 × 4 = 24 patches.

Breadth

Length 
Did you notice that 6 is the length 
of one side and 4 is the length of the 
non-equal side of the rectangle?
Go back to the previous examples 
and check whether the product of 
the length and the breadth of the 
rectangles is the same as the area 
you had calculated by counting.

Area of Rectangle 	 = Length × Breadth
Area of square patch work 	= 6 cm × 4 cm 
	 = 24 square cm

150

Chapter-11 Grandmother's Quit.indd   150 7/2/2025   6:18:35 PM



Similarly, we can also find the 
perimeter of the rectangular shape. The lengths of 

the opposite sides 
of a rectangle are 

Perimeter = Length + Length + equal.
Breadth + Breadth
	        = 2 × Length + 2 × Breadth

What will happen if all the sides of a rectangle are equal, that is, the case 
of square?

6 cm

Let us think about a square whose sides are 5 units long.

Area of Square 	 = Length × Length
Area 	 = 5 × 5
	 = 25 square cm
Perimeter of Square 	 = Length + Length + Length + Length
	 = 4 × Length
	 = 4 × 5
	 = 20 cm

Let Us Do

1.	 Find the area of your classroom floor in square meters. Take the help 
of your teacher to measure the length and breadth of the floor. What is 
the perimeter of the classroom floor?

Note for Teachers: Instead of counting each square, see that rectangles can be 
tiled by a row-column arrangement of unit squares. To find the area, they can 
simply multiply the number of rows by numbers of columns. This will also build an 
understanding of area as a model for multiplication.

Do you notice the use of a new unit ‘seconds’ in the picture?

1 min = 60 seconds

In situations like a race, ‘seconds’ help us observe small differences in time 
taken by participants. Each participant took 1 minute but how much more?
Identify the child who won the race. How much time did the child take?

Let Us Do

Estimate whether you would take seconds or minutes to complete the 
following activities. Tick the appropriate cell.

Activity Seconds Minutes
Blinking of eyes
Switching on and switching off the 
lights
Counting from 1–20
Filling a glass from the tap
Melting of an ice-cube
Making a phone call
Sitting down on the floor
Drinking a glass of water
Snapping fingers
Washing hands

Note for the Teachers: Let the learners observe and discuss who stood first, who stood 
second, and who stood third and why. Help them understand the difference between 
minutes and seconds and seconds as a unit which adds precision in measuring short 
time duration. Get the learners to observe that 60 movements of the seconds hand 
leads to a shift in the minute hand.

Conversion of Hours to Minutes

Zainab and Remo were converting time from hours to minutes and vice-versa. 

We know 1 hr = 60 min.
So, 2 hr will have 
2 × 60 = 120 min. This means that 

180 min = 3 hr.
As 3 hrs = 3 times 60 

= 180 min.

Let Us Do

1.	 Use the double number line below to complete the conversions.

(a)

Find the hidden numbers.
Numbers put in this box get 
multiplied by a number and come out.
(a)	 Can you guess the multiplier if 

you see the 4 numbers coming 
out of the box?

(b)	 Is there more than one possible 
multiplier?

(c)	 What numbers might have been 
put inside the box? 

Share your thoughts in the class.
You can also play this game with your friends.
The multipliers 1, 2, and 4 that you found above are the factors of the 
numbers that have come out of the box, that is, 28, 36, 48, and 72. 
In fact, these are the common factors of all the numbers. The numbers 28, 
36, 48, and 72 are multiples of 1, 2 and 4.
The product of two or more factors gives a multiple.
A number, when arranged in an array, shows the factors of that number. 
Are there other numbers that are factors of 15? Try to make other arrays 
for the number 15.

3 × 5 = 15

Factors Multiple

Let us make arrays for the number 12.

1 × 12 = 12
2 × 6 = 12

3 × 4 = 12

Chapter-13 Animal Jumps.indd   164 7/2/2025   6:19:27 PM



1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 are all factors of 12. Each of the numbers can divide 
12 completely. 12 is a multiple of these numbers.
Do you see why 12 is a multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12?
					    2 × ____ = 12 		  3 × ____ = 12
				   12 × ____ = 12 		  1 × ____ = 12

The number itself is always
a multiple of itself.

  Let Us Do

Make different arrays for the following numbers. Identify the factors in each 
case.
(a)	 10 (d)	 20 (g)	 37
(b)	 14 (e)	 25 (h)	 46
(c)	 13 (f)	 32 (i)	 54

Numbers like 13 and 37 are 
called prime numbers.Why?

 Animal Jumps 

A rabbit takes a jump of 4 each time. A frog takes a jump of 3 each time. 
Use the number line to figure out the numbers they will both touch. If the 
rabbit and the frog start from 0, the numbers both of them will touch are 
called the common multiples of 3 and 4.

0 3 4 6 8 9 12
12 is the first common multiple of 3 and 4. What are some other common 
multiples of 3 and 4? You can continue the number line or take help from 
the times tables of 3 and 4.

What do you notice about the common multiples of 3 and 4? Discuss in class.

Finding Directions …

I visited the Bharatpur 
Bird Sanctuary in Four Little Chicks

Rajasthan and saw an 
amazing bird called the Four Little Chicks of a bird set out to fly, 

Siberian Crane! Spreading their wings they all flew high.
They flew away from East to West,

flew North to South, without any rest.

Wow! Do you know that As they flew and explored the land,
these birds fly all the way finally, they returned home, hand in hand.
from Siberia, a very cold With their mother, they had so much to share,

place, to India? Our home is the best, beyond compare!”

I wonder how they find 
their path.

Human beings also keep 
track of directions. One of the 
ways we figure out directions 
is by facing the rising Sun. 

Let’s try!

Manu is facing the rising Sun. 
That direction is ___________.
His left hand is pointing in the_______
direction.
His right hand is pointing in the 
____________ direction.
which way is west?

Note for Teachers: Help the learners in naming the four cardinal directions. Ask the 
children to figure out the directions by facing the rising sun. Also, discuss with them 
other ways of finding directions, such as using a compass. To spark curiosity, you 
may talk about or encourage the learners to find out how birds find their directions 
during migration.
