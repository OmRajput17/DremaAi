FOREWORD
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages an
education system that is rooted in Indian ethos, and its
civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human
endeavour and knowledge while simultaneously preparing
the students to constructively engage with the prospects, and
challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational
vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum
Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across
curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’
inherent abilities (touching upon all the five planes of human
existence, the panchkoshas), in the Foundational and the
Preparatory Stages has paved the way for the progression
of their learning, further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the
Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and
the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to
Grade 8.
At the Middle Stage, the NCF-SE 2023 aims to equip
students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they
advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their
analytical, descriptive and narrative capabilities, and to
prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await
them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects, namely

Prelims.indd 3

three languages — out of which at least two languages native
to India, Science, Mathematics, Social Science, Arts Education,
Physical Education, Yoga and Well-being, and Vocational
Education will promote their holistic development.
Such a transformative learning culture requires certain
essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate
and interactive textbooks in different curricular areas,
which will play a central role in mediating between content
and pedagogy — a role that will strike a judicious balance
between direct instruction, and opportunities for exploration
and inquiry. Among the other conditions — classroom
arrangement,
technology
integration
and
teacher
preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections
both within, and across curricular areas. The National Council
of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), on its part,
is committed for providing students with such high-quality
textbooks. The various Curricular Area Groups (CAGs), which
have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable
subject experts, pedagogues, artists and practising teachers
as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop
such textbooks. Kriti, the textbook of Arts for Grade 8 is one
of these.

27-06-2025 15:15:27

iv

The contents of Kriti encompass the art forms of Theatre,
Music, Dance and Visual Arts. This textbook is for the
learners to explore their creativity as well as express and
explore themselves. Kriti has infused in its visuals and other
components, the rich Indian Knowledge Systems, India’s
artistic and cultural heritage, and values — all deeply rooted
in Bharat. Inclusivity of all genders and students with special
abilities is inherent to arts giving equal opportunity to all
students. Making optimum use of technology integration,
QR codes have been embedded throughout as additional
learning resources.
For all practical purposes, Kriti has, to my mind,
succeeded in its curricular goals — to foster natural curiosity
among students through a proper selection of theme and
content and develop the core competencies at this stage as

Prelims.indd 4

envisaged in the NCF-SE 2023 for creativity, exploration and
experiences of different art forms. The sections and chapters
are intelligently designed to accommodate and encourage all
students to experience various activities. With this, I express
my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the
development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the
expectations of all stakeholders.
At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback
from all its users for further improvement in the coming
years.

ABOUT THE BOOK
The Arts form one of the fundamental subjects to be taken by all
students in the Middle Stage — as recommended by the National
Education Policy 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework
2023 — to widen students’ horizons, expand expressive abilities,
broaden cultural literacy and appreciation, and develop creative
practices. Continuing the themes and concepts introduced
in Grades 6 and 7, this textbook of Arts for Grade 8, Kriti has
been developed to enrich further comprehension. It has four
sections —
for Theatre
for Music
for Dance and Movement
for Visual Arts
Apart from the exercises, activities and information given
in this book, there are many examples of practical and creative
ideas that can be accessed by scanning the QR codes. Let it
be clear that the assessment in Arts Education aims to make
learners creative with critical reflection and analysis. Perfection
in art is not the criterion at all, and practicing in multiple ways
independently and in teams is the roadmap for an enjoyable
and healthy artistic endeavour.
Here’s how the textbook wishes to approach different
concepts.

Prelims.indd 5

Theatre
The Theatre section in Grade 8 is an amalgamation of the
various skills and techniques learnt in the previous grades,
along with newer insights into various aspects unexplored so
far. Students develop themselves in Grade 8 by creating their
own script as a team. Here, the students not only share and
write stories, but also look at integrating other art forms learnt
so far-like puppetry, mime, dance and music — into scripts. Once
their script is ready, they decide roles, assign teams for costume,
set and props, and eventually perform a full-fledged play with
minimal support from the teacher. This process helps the class
to immerse themselves in the process of theatre-making. It
gives them a first-hand experience of the minor details involved
in the development of a play. Finally, they are introduced to the
field of theatre appreciation. Understanding the perspective of
a theatre audience by writing their own review gives them a
different perspective of looking at a theatrical performance. As
they complete the Middle Stage with a play production, they are
all set to explore more specialised details in the next stage.

Music
The journey evolves by delving further into swar, laya and shabd,
the basic components in Music. The multifaceted expressions
of Music like reciting shlokas in Sanskrit through swar and

30-06-2025 14:50:39

vi

laya patterns, singing songs in various regional languages
of India (folk or traditional), performing jingles or playing
signature tunes used for promotion of products, and practising
complicated patterns of the seven notes in different layas — are
all pedagogies that aim to explore the vast and flexible domain
of Music. Along with them, acquiring basic skills in singing
and playing of musical instruments, including nuances of both
Hindustani and Carnatic Music for rendition of ragas, and
presentation methods are also a curricular focus.
Interdisciplinary concepts such as how science and music
are connected, and an insight into the construction of musical
instruments, are also given. While stories of some inspiring
musicians are provided, students are encouraged to learn
about musicians in their community and understand their
contributions. A section is devoted to encouraging students to
start introspecting about how to continue making music a part
of their lives. There are a variety of careers associated with
music today. These involve not only the knowledge and interest
in music but also the connection of music to technology, design,
healthcare, etc. While an introduction to careers has been given,
students are now of an age where they can explore such ideas
themselves, with inspiration and guidance from the teacher.

Dance and Movement
Dance continues to build on learning from previous classes,
focusing on the principles of rhythm and movement. This
year, students are introduced to the concept of breath or prana

Prelims.indd 6

in dance, the principles of stithi and gati, and the building of
dance phrases to be strung into a complete performance. They
are introduced to the eight major dance forms of India, while
continuing to learn about other traditional dances and the
important personalities of dance. Importantly, they focus on
understanding and expressing their emotions as a cathartic
experience. They also learn about the Indian martial arts and
their incorporation in dance. The textbook also maintains a
focus on inclusivity and social change through dance. In the
final chapter, they present a performance integrating all their
learnings in the arts, with focus on interdisciplinarity.

Visual Arts
This section aims to strengthen and extend fundamental
knowledge and skills in the Visual Arts.
The first chapter deepens the learners’ understanding of
elements and principles of visual art and design. The second
chapter enables them to envision a still life composition in
colour. They are able to find objects meaningful to them and
arrange them appropriately. The third chapter focuses on the
techniques of perspective drawing as well as ratio and proportion
of the human body to increase their abilities and confidence
in drawing. The fourth chapter draws attention to art in their
everyday life and the practices that have been continuing over
many generations. This chapter also gives opportunity to reflect
on sustainable practices by working with everyday materials
like fibres, cloth and paper to create beautiful artworks. The

27-06-2025 15:15:27

fifth chapter urges them to reflect on their own knowledge
in using basic design skills and creating a campaign to raise
awareness about art and its practices.
A variety of activities are designed in each chapter to help
students experience and learn skills in Visual Arts that will be of
use to them in their journey ahead.

to celebrate the incredible artistic legacy of India. It will be
interesting for students to see how activities in each art form
integrate with other disciplines like Science, Mathematics,
Language, and Social Science, offering a holistic approach
to education. Thus students will explore an interesting and
engaging world of arts in Grade 8.

TIME ALLOCATION AND ASSESSMENTS
The Arts textbook contains four sections, each dealing with a
separate art form. It is important to plan the timetable in a way
that distributes the learning of all art forms equally across the
year.
As per the NCF-SE 2023, the time allocated for Arts for
the entire academic year is — 100 hours (or 150 periods of 40
minutes each).
This book has been written keeping in mind this time
allocation.
It is preferable to have all four art forms distributed
across the week as the progress of all sections would happen
simultaneously. It is better to avoid a system where one art form
is taken up after the full completion of the other.

Under the Illustrative Timetable of the NCF-SE, Arts has been
allocated 4 periods during the week and 1 period on Saturday.
The document also suggests the use of block periods, where two
periods (40 minutes) are combined to make enough time for
activity-based classes. This would give a continuous stretch of
time (80 minutes, i.e., 1 hour 20 minutes).
Based on these options the four art forms could be allocated
the four periods on weekdays, and Saturday could be used for
activities that are interdisciplinary or for taking students on artbased field trips, like concerts, performances or art galleries.

While the first plan with 40 periods will have classes for all four
art forms every week, the second plan will have only two art
forms per week. Every individual art form would have classes
every alternative week. It is important to have all art forms

progressing simultaneously as it would enable the students
to understand the inter-connections between the art forms in
order to get a holistic understanding.

ASSESSMENT
Assessments in Arts play a crucial role in understanding, and
nurturing students’ creative abilities and artistic growth. Unlike
other subjects, Arts assessments focus on evaluating a wide
range of skills, including creativity, critical thinking, technical
proficiency and expressive capabilities. These assessments
are designed not only to measure progress and mastery but
also to encourage exploration, self-expression, and a deeper
appreciation for the arts.

 Summative assessment is to have a separate day allotted for
assessment. Activities conducted in class during the year and
its variations can be used to assess the understanding, and
ability of the student in the skills and competencies. Examples
are given at the end of each section to enable better planning.
Whatever is suggested spontaneous creation by students is a
merit to be rewarded.

Methods of assessments

Grades and Scores

As the assessment processes are primarily skill-based, it is not
dependent on the ‘correct or wrong answer’ given by the students.
It is, therefore, important not to structure ‘tests’ with question
papers and written answers. This would entirely defeat the
purpose of the approach used in the Arts curriculum. A variety
of assessment methods such as portfolios, performance reviews,
project-based evaluations and reflective self-assessments can
give insights into each student’s unique artistic journey.

Since, art is about creativity, visualisation, expression and
imagination, it cannot have correct or wrong answers. Scoring
here, is therefore, based on parameters of the level of skill
acquired and the competencies acquired by the students. The
teacher is to be completely familiar with the competencies
and learning outcomes for each activity in order to have a fair
assessment through scores.
A 5-point scale is suggested for marking in every criterion.
This would enable teachers, parents and students to get clarity
on how they are progressing. The table below can be used as
a reference to mark the 5-point scale in the rubrics that are
provided after each chapter.
It is important to combine both quantitative assessment
(scores or grades based on rubrics) and qualitative assessment
(teacher’s observations on the student’s behaviour, interest,
progress and other aspects that may not be mentioned in the
rubrics).

Formative and Summative assessments
 Formative assessment is based on observations in every class
and the performance of the student in each activity. Rubrics
provided at the end of each chapter help in structuring the
scores or grades through the year.

When all parts of a performance like script,
acting, music and others are connected, and
churned together in a nicely composed and wellknit manner, it will seem like a beautiful garland
of flowers. This teaches all the four different
types of knowledge to the audience.

Abhinava Gupta lived in Kashmir between the 10th and 11th century CE. He wrote a commentary on Nāṭyaśhāstra and was
instrumental in adding shanta rasa as the 9th rasa in the Navarasas.

NOTE TO THE TEACHERS
Dear Theatre Teacher,
As the students of Grade 8 are crossing a milestone
by completing the middle stage of their creative and
dramatic journey, this is the time for consolidation
and confidence-building.
At this stage, the young learners are not just
performers in the making, but also thoughtful
collaborators and reflective individuals. This book has
been designed to assimilate all they have explored in
the previous years — from movement, and expression
to storytelling and stagecraft. The activities and
exercises in these pages will help the students fine-tune
their theatrical skills, sharpen their communication,
and cultivate a sense of responsibility — not only as
artists, but also as teammates, problem-solvers, and
critical thinkers.
This book encourages students to step up as
powerful performers and capable backstage crew,
giving them tools to plan, rehearse, review, and
reflect. It honours the craft of performance while also
emphasising discipline and ownership — values that
will serve them far beyond the stage.
Let this be a year of exploration, expression and
excellence, where the rehearsal room becomes a

ch-1_theater.indd 2

mirror, a stage, and a stepping stone. The curtains
are ready to rise. Along with you, the show will go
on — with purpose and pride.
Assessment
This is one of the crucial parts of the entire process of
studying theatre in school as a mainstream subject.
Though it is important to have marks or grades like
in every subject, it is also essential to keep the spirit
of theatre intact, and not reduce it to a pen and paper
exam with a question paper. The final outcome or
presentation is not the only benchmark. The thought
and process behind the activities also need to be
considered with —


Knowledge application



Effort and participation



Creativity and presentation



Teamwork and collaboration

Read the section on time allocation and
assessments at the beginning of the book for better
clarity. Assessment for Theatre has been planned at
different levels.

27-06-2025 11:16:25

Formative Assessment: This is to be done in class
after completing the activities and chapters, at two
levels —

ch-1_theater.indd 3



Circle time — A process followed after every
class and every activity. The teacher sits with
the students in an informal setting (to get honest
responses from students) to ask questions about
what they did. They share their thoughts and
experiences, based on which the teacher makes
notes about each student. Some questions are
given in the textbook. The teacher can explore
more questions based on the class’s response.



Rubrics — Upon completion of every chapter, a
rubric has been shared with the desired learning
outcomes that the teacher can mark. The student
is also asked to grade themself based on their
perception of their performance in that chapter.
This self-analysis is also a feedback for the teacher.

Summative Assessment: This will be an
activity-based test conducted at the end of the year.
The activities need to be a combination of the lessons
learnt during the year. The assessment is conducted
at an individual and group level to assess different
skills and competencies. A set of sample activities has
been given at the end of the section.

Bringing Words Alive
Play reading
Reading the script of a play is the
first step towards creating a fullfledged production. But did you
know that this first step itself can
become the final performance?

You will learn
 Play reading as a performing art
 Voice training
 Impactful speaking

Rehearsed reading or stage reading is a form
of theatre.

REHEARSED READING
Rehearsed reading is performed without any set,
props, costumes or make-up. The actors, dressed
in regular clothes, sit on chairs on the stage and
read the lines of their character aloud.
However, it is much more than just reading
aloud. It is an art that brings characters, emotions,
and stories to life. To make this happen, every
word, pause and expression has to be given equal
importance. Then, each dialogue becomes an
engaging experience.
This experience not only sharpens the
imagination but also connects the text directly
to the audience, without the need of any visual
enhancements like set or costumes.

ch-1_theater.indd 4

You may say it sounds simple — “That’s so easy …
I can do it.”
Of course, you can do it! But this also requires a lot
of hard work, practise and effort. The only difference
is — all the effort goes towards perfecting your voice,

This process is similar to a singing practice.
Both work on your vocal cords, pitch, volume,
and the emotion it evokes!

interpretation of characters and emotions. The
actors remain in character throughout the reading
and use all energy to emote through their voice.
Sounds interesting? Let us try a few activities and
exercises that can make you a voice actor!
Since this style of acting focuses primarily on
speech and dialogue delivery, the areas that we
work on are related to the same. We will work on
improving —
 Clarity in speech


Voice and diction

Slightly different forms of this are — radio plays,
voice acting and dubbing. The concept is the
same, but it does not happen on stage.



Emoting through speech

All these aspects are completely dependent on
your physical body. You cannot take support of any
equipment or instrument to enhance the effect. So,
let us first understand how voice is produced in our
body.
While most of us assume it is from the vocal
cords, you will be surprised to know that vocal
cords are among the varied parts of our body that
help us produce a wide range of sounds, speech
and voices.

Understanding this will help you in better voice
control, enabling you to produce the right kind of
voice expected for that particular line in the script.
The pitch, volume and emoting ability originate in
these areas of the body!

This is called Vāchika abhinaya in the
Nāṭyaśhāstra. Vāchika means ‘speech or language’.
Any performance that has speech or use of language,
even in the form of songs (in case of dance) is called
Vāchika abhinaya.

ACTIVITY 1.1: CLARITY IN SPEECH
The clarity of speech is determined by how well
each syllable is pronounced, how clear and distinct
the words are during the delivery. Even the best
of speakers sometimes fumble, stutter or overlap
words. The best way to avoid them is to practise
saying the most difficult words or word sets. Once
you master these, regular speech becomes a breeze.
These word-sets are called tongue twisters.
They are phrases that have similar sounds, which
makes it hard to pronounce. The more you practise,
the easier it gets and your pronunciation improves.
Start by reading slowly. Increase the speed
gradually, till you can say it without any flaw. If
you fumble, restart and keep trying.
Here are some challenging tongue twisters —
 She sells sea shells on the sea shore.
 Red lorry yellow lorry.

 Peter Piper picked

twisters exist in every
language. Do you know any tongue
twisters in your local language? Share
them with your friends, and learn more!

ACTIVITY 1.2: DICTION
To improve your diction, you can practise speaking
slowly, and pausing between sentences or ideas.
This will help you articulate
your words more clearly,
emphasise key points,
and give your audience
the time to process
the information. You
can also use pauses to
create interest, suspense, or
emotion in your speech.
Speed: What is the pace at which you
are speaking? And what is the pacing between
the words you utter? Does the dialogue require a
slow pace or a fast-paced delivery? Exploring the
different speeds when reciting
the tongue twisters can help
you see the range of emotions
you can express through your
voice.
Intonations: Intonations are
the stress and emphasis we
placed on specific words to add
importance in our speech. We
generally stress on a word that

ch-1_theater.indd 8

we find important. You can practise by stressing a
different word of the tongue twister as you repeat
it, and then multiple words to see how the meaning
changed.

WORD IMPACT!
Take a simple sentence that is grammatically
correct and play around with it by
emphasising each word differently.
Discuss how it changes the meaning of the
sentence!
Example: ‘I didn’t go to school today.’
You can take turns with your friends
in stressing the highlighted word and
discuss what the meaning of the sentence would be.
I didn’t go to school today.

(… but my friends went)

I didn’t go to school today.

(… so I missed the games)

I didn’t go to school today.

(… but got all the lessons)

I didn’t go to school today.

(… but walked past it on
the way to the fair)

I didn’t go to school today.

(… went to the park
instead)

I didn’t go to school today.

(… but will go tomorrow)

VOLUME AND PITCH
Although the concept of volume and pitch are
prominently used in music, it is very crucial for
theatre students to learn this, as good acting depends
entirely on it. You can refer to your music lessons
while practising.
Volume is how loud or soft a sound is. You must
have tried this while playing music on your gadgets.
In theatre, controlling volume helps the emotions and
messages to reach the audience. This is true even in
our everyday lives. Don’t you scream loudly if you
are angry? Animals use them too. Lions roar loudly to
show power and dominance — as if declaring, “This
is my territory!”, in a booming voice. Whereas, a cat
meows softly to show comfort and affection. Similarly
in theatre, loud volume can express strong
emotions like anger or joy, while soft
volume can portray sadness, fear or
kindness. Learning to adjust the volume
helps to express emotion more
clearly and connect better with
the audience, just like animals
communicate their feelings in
the wild.

Pitch is how high or low a
sound is. A high pitch often
shows excitement, fear or
playfulness, like how you
scream when you get a surprise
gift. A low pitch can suggest
seriousness, calmness or
anger. For example, when
a mouse squeaks in a very
high-pitched sound, it is
usually scared or excited. In
contrast, a bear growls in a
deep and low pitch sound to
warn others or show aggression. In theatre, actors
changes their pitch to bring characters to life, for
example, a childlike character speak in a high pitch,
or a wise old king speak in a deep and low tone.
Mastering pitch helps to create different personalities
and express a wide range of emotions.
Since we are looking at the examples of animals to
understand this concept and what it can communicate,
here is a simple table to help you understand it better.
Notice the different combinations of volume and
pitch of each animal.

ACTIVITY 1.3: GUESS THE ANIMAL EMOTION!
Here you can become an animal, an animal that
shows human emotions! Match the sounds of
animal with emotions using the volume and pitch.
One of you can come to the front and makes an
animal sound. But they must pick an emotion
secretly (happy, scared, angry, sad, or any other
emotion), and adjust their sound. The rest of the
class guesses the animal and the emotion based on
the Volume (loud/soft) and Pitch (high/low).

ch-1_theater.indd 10

You can try different combinations of animals
and emotions. For example, a happy lion might
give a soft growl, where as a scared mouse might
let out a super tiny squeal. You can try a happy and
angry dog, or a tired and excited goat.
Remember: Try not to use expressions or body
language that might give away the emotion. This
activity requires you to use only your voice.

ACTIVITY 1.5: EMOTING THROUGH SPEECH

ch-1_theater.indd 12

SPEAKING WITHOUT LANGUAGE!

BASIC

Have you ever wondered how every word we speak
has a meaning attached to it? If we spoke random
sets of words with no meaning, would we still be
able to communicate?
Communication depends not just on what
we say but also how we say it. In fact there are
instances when we don’t know the language of the
person speaking to us, but we still manage to get
the gist of what is being said. How is that possible?
This is because the human brain can receive inputs
beyond a learnt language. The brain receives
information from the tone of the voice,
facial expression, body
language and the context
when it is spoken.
Let
us
try
an
experiment where we
assume that each of you have
come from a different planet and
speak a unique language that nobody
else understands. You have to make
up sentences with a set of
random sounds. This kind of
speech is called gibberish.

When you put together some random sounds, no
one is likely to understand. Now, try saying this
in a particular emotion. Say the same gibberish
sentence like you are annoyed with your friend who
is disturbing you and not letting you study. Use your
voice, action and expression to convey this. Now, most
of your friends can make some sense of what you are
communicating. Combine it with volume and pitch to
help in better communication.
Now, try the same with different emotions and
situations. Let the other students in class guess
what you are trying to say. Everyone gets a turn to
communicate with gibberish. How many of them
could you understand?

ADVANCED
The next level would be to try and have a simple
conversation in gibberish! Sit with a friend and speak
a sentence with emotion. Let the person respond to
you. Continue this for about 4 – 5 lines. Now, stop and
share what you actually meant.
You can also put yourself in different situations for
this conversation, like a village fair, an office, school
playground, etc.

27-06-2025 11:16:36

Note to the Teacher:
Look out for students
who use simple gibberish
instead of complex
gibberish. A complex
gibberish has many
combinations of syllables
and sounds, compared to a
simple gibberish.
Example of a simple
gibberish, “Tata tatata ta
ttaat tatata. Or papapa pap
papa paapapa papapap”
Complex combination —
‘tagutta mo le bo ungji ko"
Encourage the students
to use multiple syllables,
and change the rhythm of
the sounds.
Motivate the
students to
use complex
combinations
to bring
expression.

One Stage,
Many Scripts

The most fundamental aspect of
any performance is the script.
It is important to write down
your ideas and thoughts on
paper to develop them further.
In fact, that is why this textbook
is written. It will not be enough for a teacher or a
mentor to just talk about a concept and assume
that you have understood and will remember it.
Writing helps in multiple ways such as —


Bringing clarity



Building on idea with more creativity



Sharing with others for collaborative work



Helping you remember and refer back when
required



Acting as record for future generations

Writing takes many forms. You might be familiar
with short stories, essays, poems, letters or emails,
articles, or blogs. Not just that but every movie, TV
show, web series, news telecast or documentary
you watch also has a detailed scripts written for it.
Writing, in it’s various forms, is the invisible thread
that ties all communication together.

SCRIPTS FOR STAGE
Play scripts are written works intended for the
performance on stage, in film, or on television.
Depending on the kind of performance they
are designed for they vary in structure, style
and purpose. Some of the most common types
of play scripts are listed below. Each type of
play script serves a different artistic purpose,
reflecting human experiences in unique ways.
Understanding these types allows us to appreciate
the diversity of theatrical storytelling.

Play scripts in ancient India
Ancient Indian thinkers use the term rupa or
rupaka for drama. The ancient Indian writers
mostly use a term drushya kavya (visible poetry).
The writings usually combined the dialogue and
poetry. So, all the Sanskrit play writers were also
poets. The Nāṭyaśhāstra describes the different
types of writing drama! Let us compare it with
the current types of scripts —

TYPES OF SCRIPTS
DAŚHA RŪPAKA (NĀṬYAŚHĀSTRA)
Nataka has 5 to 10 acts based on the stories on kings or
divine beings with love, heroism or pathos.

Classification in scriptss
One-act plays are short dramatic works, typically lasting
10 – 30 minutes, that focus on a single, dominant and
dramatic situation or conflict within a single act.

Prakarana has upto 10 acts. It is an entirely invented plot, Two-act plays are stories with a climactic midpoint where
based on the society.
the stakes rise or the protagonistʼs goal changes.
Bhana is a one-act play with an invented plot based on the
rogues and heroism.

Three-act structure is a common plot structure used in
films and television, divided into setup, confrontation, and
resolution.

Prahasana is a one-act play based on the humour and
happy contexts. It is comical in nature.

Linear, cyclical and non-linear are different ways to
structure the plot, including flashbacks and
non-chronological storytelling.

Dima has four acts based on a popular story, including
Devas and Asuras.

Adapted script is based on pre-existing materials like
novels, books, poetry, short stories or historical events.

Vyayoga is a one-act play based on the traditional heroic
stories that are non-comical.
Samavakara has 3 – 4 acts based on the traditional stories
of Devas and Asuras.
Anka (Utsrishtanka) is a one-act play that is composed
primarily based on the karuna rasa.
Ihamrga is a four-act play that mixes popular stories and
fiction based on pauranik stories.
Veethi is a one-act play with just 2 – 3 characters that can
be performed at any location.

ACTIVITY 2.1: SCRIPT YOUR STYLE!
While the writers wrote and experimented in different
forms of writing over the centuries, let us do a simple
experiment in class!
Note: This can be done either in groups or individually.
We will try four types of scripts. Each group (or
individual) picks one type of script from the list below —
 Dialogue script — Characters speak directly
 Narrative script — Narrator tells the story
 Mime script — Only actions and stage directions
 Musical script — Includes lyrics or rhythmic speech
The common topic for everyone is — two friends walking
in a forest, where they find a box that has the birch bark
and other writing material that Kalidasa used.
Write one page in a style of your choice and compare
the scripts. Discuss —
 Did the style affect the content?
 How does the experience of the audience vary?

According to the Nāṭyaśhāstra, the first written
script was a Samavakara (the 7th in the above list)
by Brahma. It was based on the Amrita Manthana.
As the process of creation of the performing arts,
(Natyotpatti, learnt in Grade 6) had a discussion,
and debate between the Devas and the Asuras,
Brahma thought it was appropriate for the first
performance to be about them. The Amrita
Manthana (churning of the ocean) by the Devas
and Asuras, is a significant event
that has been depicted in
different parts of the world.
The picture above is an

Note to the Teacher: Though the above activity requires only one page, encourage the students to extend their
writing and build the story creatively. They can also try multiple styles to explore the possibilities.
This activity can also be extended to writing assignments of other subjects, such as Language or Social Science.
Instead of writing an essay, the students can write it in the form of a story or a script.

by distinctive features. It
essentially refers to a category
or class of works within a
particular form that share
common characteristics.

Based on the features in the
writing, both in its style and
content, it is categorised into a
particular genre. The popular

characters and situations.

These are only a few of examples of genre. There
are books and records that have documented more
than 300 genres! The ones mentioned above are
broad-based and can include most works of literature.
However, there are also writings in which the features
of two genres are combined. In such cases, though the
predominant theme is considered, it is listed under
both categories. For example, tragicomedy is a blend
of tragedy and comedy, the play mixes the serious
themes with moments of humour and relief.
Have you wondered — why is the concept of genre
is necessary? Why should we categorise them into
different boxes? Can it not just be a free and creative
way of expressing an idea?

Docudrama: Presents a
dramatised re-enactments of
real events and facts.

1.

Genre is necessary because it provides a
framework for understanding and interpreting
texts. A piece of writing can be written in
different ways depending on the context. The
reader or the audience may not know the state
of mind or the intent of the writer. This might
lead to mis-interpretations and complications in
understanding the text. Stating the genre helps
avoid this problem.

2.

It facilitates better organisation of works. For
example, if you go to a public library or a book
store, you will see books classified based on the
categories of genre. It makes it easy to access
as you won’t have to look among thousands of
books everytime!

The writer of plays is called a playwright.
Our country has seen hundreds of brilliant playwrights over
the years. From the Sanskrit playwrights like Bhasa and Kalidasa
to the present day, there are numerous plays written on all genres.
Here are two such examples from the 19th century —
Bharatendu Harishchandra — Born in Varanasi
in 1850, he is known as the father of modern Hindi
literature. He used the pen name ‘Rasa’. His most
popular play ‘Andher Nagri’ is performed in all
languages till today.
T. P. Kailasam — Born in Karnataka in 1884, he
wrote numerous plays in a unique style that combined
Kannada and English. His plays are translated and
performed across the country till today. He was
known for his satire and sarcastic comedy, earning
him the title ‘Prahasana Prapitamaha’.

Even music, dance and visual
arts have genres! Just like the
genres in theatre.
Music and dance have
genres like —
•

Classical

•

Folk

•

Contemporary

•

Semi-classical

… and many more.
Visual arts has categories like —
•

Portrait

•

Landscape

•

Still life

… and many more.

ACTIVITY 2.2: GENRE GENIUS!
Now that we have discussed so much about various genres, you
must have connected them to the books you have read, or the
movies and plays you have watched. Let us try to categorise these
paragraphs into the genres we have learnt. Remember, they could
belong to specific genres or a combination of genres! Think and
respond —

How many have
you learnt so far?

Title: The Curious Case of the Vanishing Vada Pav
Detective Riya sniffed the empty lunchbox. “Someone
here”, she squinted at her classmates, “has onion breath
and a guilty conscience”.
“I ... I was just checking if it was fresh!” Kushal
stammered. Just then, the principal walked in munching.
“Delicious snack”, she commented.
Case closed. Kushal fainted.

Title: Lunchbox Rhapsody
The bell had rung, the bags unzipped,
With spoons in hand, the rhythm gripped.
Smita sang of soft idlis,
Rohan drummed with expert ease.
Tiffins twirled in a tasty trance,
Aruna broke into a chutney dance.

Anil folded his last paper boat and
placed it in the rainwater stream.
It wobbled, and then drifted away.
His sister had made hundreds

He whispered, “This one’s for
you”. The wind howled like her laughter.
As the boat disappeared, so did his childhood.

In ancient Mohenjodaro, little Tara found a glowing tabla
in the ruins. When she played it, a magical portal opened.
Suddenly, Kalidasa appeared, reciting a verse in rhythm!
“Back to your time!” he warned.
Tara stopped playing — and poof!
Back in class, she blinked.
Her tabla whispered, “Next stop — Maratha Empire?”.

THEATRE-MAKING
Now, we enter the exciting
world of theatre-making! This
is where ideas turn into action,
and stories come alive with
teamwork. In this chapter, you won’t just read about
theatre — you will create it! From planning a scene
to rehearsing lines and designing costumes to setting
the stage, you will discover how every small role
builds the big picture. As you are at the end of middle
stage, this is when you will put together everything
you have learnt so far.
From costume design and make up, to puppetry
and mime; and from writing your own script and
dialogues, to acting with emotion and voice.
Recall all your lessons, so you are ready to
turn your imagination into a performance! Let the
theatre-making begin!
This chapter intends to take you through the entire
journey — from an idea to a successful performance.
To make it interesting, this process is written as a
play script itself. This script is about the students of
Grade 8 working towards putting up a performance
on their own. It assimilates all the steps you have

ch-3_theater.indd 27

 Process of

 The spirit of

worked on so far to make a play. It also suggests ideas
on how to integrate music and dance into the play.
This script can also be used as an example for your
exercise in Play Reading, Chapter 1.
The end of this chapter gives you pointers and tips
on how to practically apply this to the performance
that you put up for your school. Remember, facilities
or material resources are not a necessity. So, do not
worry about what you have or don’t. Theatre can be
performed anywhere with whatever you have. The
most important thing that you must have is dedication
and the enthusiasm that you will do it!
Let us get involved in making drama!

ALL THE DRAMA OF THEATRE!
The play begins in the Grade 8 classroom. The class
has just received a circular from the school principal
that the students have to plan and prepare for a
performance. The date of the show is also announced.
The countdown has begun and the students are excited,
nervous and unsure of how they can do it. Ananya, the
class representative starts by addressing the class.

Scene 1: Brainstorming
(A classroom with excited students busy discussing in
groups. The board reads ‘Annual Theatre Project’.)
Ananya: Alright, as per the memo we have just
received, our school show is in just six weeks. The
play should be 30 to 40 minutes long. Letʼs give our
best and make this the best experience!
Karan: Yes, we should be the best! So, first, we need
to find a great story. Should we do comedy, mystery
or fantasy? Oh ... but before that, who is doing the
documentation? Photos, videos? We have to keep a
record of this event — we are doing our own show!
Ananya: Oh, yes! Glad, you remembered ! I can do it.
I love taking pictures!
Meera: Can we do a Panchatantra or a Hitopadesha
story?

ch-3_theater.indd 28

Ritu: (hesitating) What about a folktale? Or, an Indian
story? We could add some classical or folk dance in it.
Meera: Yes! And we could mix it with puppetry or
mime. It will be fun!
Anil: (excited) Oh! I will find some great instrumental
music like dholak and sarod.
Ananya: Perfect! So, an Indian story it is. Letʼs all
suggest stories from our native regions and shortlist
one.
Tara: How about the tale of Savitri and Satyavan?
Seema: Or, Tenali Rama? Something with humor
and wit.

19-06-2025 15:26:16

Ananya: Hmm ... but wait. We’ve got three good ones.
Savitri and Satyavan is emotional, Tenali Rama is
witty, and ʻMonkey and Crocodileʼ is fun and visual.
How do we choose? Should we vote?
Ritu: Can we mix elements? Maybe Tenaliʼs wit, but
with animal characters like the monkey and crocodile!
Meera: That could be chaotic!
Anil: I think we should focus on something simple
but dramatic. But there are so many stories.
Ananya: Let’s take five minutes, everyone think and
vote.
Karan: (confidently) I know a very interesting story of
an old wise woman from the mountains of Himalayas.
My father told me that story. Do you want to hear it?
Everyone: Yes!
(They huddle, discuss and finally settle on the
Himalayan folktale with elements of dance, puppetry,
and folk music.)

(Three more students agree to join Karan in the script
writing and forming a team.)
Ananya: So, Karan and his team will work on it
together. Can you give us the final script in three
days? That way, we can start planning the rehearsals.
Ritu: Don’t forget to include dance, puppetry and folk
music. I want to do the choreography.

Ananya: Done! I think this story has a great
beginning — middle, end, and an interesting conflict
as well. Can we start writing the scenes and dialogues?
Who can do it?

Karan: Sure. We will give it in three days. But as we
rehearse, I might want to add a few lines here and
there to improve it.

Karan: (strongly) I will write the script. But I will need
help. Who can join me?

Meera: (disappointed) But I also like dancing. I wanted
to work on the songs as well. I have been going to

Ananya: That is fine. We can always keep improving.

dance classes since, I was five years old. Now, I can’t
do it since Ritu is doing it.
Ananya: Hey! No … that’s not how it is! You can
definitely work together. This is all going to be a team
work. You and Ritu can work together on selecting
the songs and planning the steps.
(Ritu and Meera happily give
high-five, and sit together to
discuss.)
Ananya: Since we have already
made two teams, I think we can
also assign the other teams, so
we are all ready by the time the
script is complete.
(Ananya writes the names of all teams on the board
and asks everyone to volunteer. After some discussion,
they have the following.)

Please volunteer. Aditya, Neetu, Priya, Sriram …

Aditya and Sriram: (sounding disinterested) We want
to select roles and act on stage. Can’t do this work.
(Nobody wants to do these things. The rest of the class
also say they want to act on stage. Despite repeated

Ananya, feeling helpless, requests the
teacher to help.)
Teacher: Great start, everyone.
I really like your story! But
remember, backstage work is
most important! You learnt in
Grade 7 that all these departments
are a foundation for a good
performance. Everyone in class
has to be a part of at least one
of the groups written on the
board. You can also act, after
the script is given. You all have
to put effort as a united team.

run to the teacher for help and suggestions, and come
back to work on them.)
Karan: (loudly announcing) We have almost completed
the script. Can we read it for you? (everyone nods and
looks towards them.)
Scene 1, an old house on the Himalayan slopes. A
granny is sitting, reading a book. Her grandson
comes to her and says, “Naani, Iʼm hungry”. The
grandmother goes to the kitchen, gives him a snack
and later, they start playing a game together.

(Understanding this, the remaining students select
various groups and start working.)

Scene 2: Work Begins
(3 days later — students are working in groups. Karan
and his team are writing; Ritu and Anita are drawing
and cutting out puppets; Anil and Meera are working on
musical notes with beats, and steps. They occasionally

capture your audience’s attention in the first scene.

and grandson as they look out of the window. Can I
continue now? (continues)
The boy is scared and says, “Naani, what is that?
Will it harm us?” The grandmother says, “Nothing
can harm us if we are strong and brave. Let us go out
and see”. But the boy runs and hides under the cot.
Anil: This seems like a modern story — with a
space-ship and all! What next? Aliens will come out
of it (laughs loudly). This is a futuristic play. Not a folk
play!

Karan: Hey, wait … it is coming up! I have read only
one line so far! (continues)
(As they are playing, they hear a loud scream
outside. They rush to the window and see that a big
spaceship has landed on the mountain, and all the
neighbours are looking at it in awe.)
Nikhil: Karan, we can’t show all this on stage. How
can we make a spaceship land? How can we show
mountains? You have to write something that is
practically possible.
Karan: (annoyed that no one likes his script) Please
wait and listen to the whole thing. You don’t have to
make mountains on stage. All this is depicted only
through the conversation between the grandmother

ch-3_theater.indd 32

Meera: Yes! It is not a folk story at all. Where can we
bring in dance? (in a teasing tone) I can’t do
a folk dance with aliens!
Anita: I can’t think of puppetry either,
for a story like this.
Karan: (angrily) Ok … fine. You write
the script yourself. Nobody wants to
listen. I can’t continue writing like
this (puts down the script on the
desk with a thud and walks out).
Ananya: (quickly runs out and
brings him back and addresses the
class) Karan and his team have
worked hard to come up with this.

19-06-2025 15:26:23

First, let us listen to the entire
script. It is important to give
feedback as it will help him
improve the script. But let us
not interrupt the reading. We
have to respect each other’s
work. He too knows what we
can show on stage and what
the school allows us. I am
sure he has kept all that in his
mind along with the dance
and puppetry, while writing.
(Karan nods in agreement.)
You can continue reading
Karan. We will make notes
and share it at the end.
(They all listen, make notes,
share and discuss. Karan
makes changes based on
some suggestions. At the end,
everyone looks happy and
confident that their play is
going to be great!)

Scene 3: Rehearsals and Preparation
(It has been a week since practice has started. Roles are allotted, preparation is
in full swing. Tension is in the air as students are arguing.)
Nikhil: This is chaos! Everyoneʼs using my costume corner like a dumping
ground! Every time I arrange the costume designs in order of the script,
someone messes it up.
Ritu: I need space to dry the crocodile puppet! Anita! (shouts) Please help!
Karan: My script team canʼt focus with all this shouting. You have suggested
changes and now, you don’t allow us to work! We canʼt even remember your
suggestion for Scene 3. So much distraction!
Meera: And don’t even ask about dance rehearsals. No oneʼs showing up!

Teacher: (smiling) That means youʼre right

Everyone: Huh?
Teacher: Every team hits a wall. It’s part of
the creative process. You’re all passionate
and excited — that’s good. But now, step
back, breathe and listen to each other.
Ananya: We’ve all been so focused on our
own parts that we forgot — this is one story,
one show.

Anil: I composed three songs and now the dance team
says they want something else! I can’t keep doing this.
Ananya: (shouting louder, trying to calm them) Guys!
This is not working. We’re supposed to be a team!

Anil: I’ll coordinate with Ritu and Anita. I have to
work on music for dance and puppetry separately.

Karan: Everything’s falling apart. Weʼre stuck!

Ananya: No work has been completed and we only

Teacher: Exactly. Here’s a tip — use a

chart
so
all
departments are aligned. Find different
places to work. You can look for empty
rooms or even go to the playground. Hold a
combined check-in every two days.

19-06-2025 15:26:26

Teacher: Good! Now, back to work. Find your places.
Don’t disturb each other. But remember, you are all
one team. So work together.

Scene 4: The First Run-through
(In the school auditorium. Only about 4 to 5 teachers
are watching. Students perform one scene after
another. Lots of mistakes. More laughter. They complete
performing and sit in a circle for feedback.)
Ananya: Sorry ma’am … there were a lot of mistakes.
We had practised … but …
Teacher 1: Actually, completing it from
beginning to end is a huge task in itself!
You have to clap for your team. Well done!
About your corrections, the scene
transitions were slow. You took a lot of
time to shift from one scene to another.
You need smoother scene changes. Who
is in charge of set and props?

Teacher 2: Good thinking. Also, project your voice
more. I couldn’t hear some of your lines clearly.
You have to be aware of the stage-voice. It does not
mean you have to scream. You should be able to hold
emotions and yet project your voice in such a way
that it is audible to the last row.
Ananya: Thank you, ma’am. We’ll fix these before
the final show.
Teacher 3: I really loved how you used puppetry to
depict the little boy’s dream. The connection between
the music of puppetry and the folk dance is a brilliant

Nikhil: It’s me. I too felt we took a lot of
time to change set and props for each
scene. I think we’ll arrange all the required
props, scene wise. That’ll help cover the
time. We lost a lot of time running around
to fetch props.

Aditya is nowhere to be seen. If he doesn’t say his line,
puppetry can’t begin. Tension. Actors don’t know what

teamwork, creativity and that every part matters.

ACTIVITY 3.1: THOUGHT SPLASH!
What are the immediate thoughts in
your mind after reading the entire play?
Relatable? Felt like it was happening
in your class? Did you have any
questions? Write down your immediate
thoughts here. You can also make
drawings or doodles of what is on your
mind.
You can share and discuss the points
you have noted with the rest of the class,
and see what others think about it.
Now, let us analyse the play script
and see what we can learn from it.
Each scene has different elements of
theatre-making that you can learn and
apply in the process of preparing for
your performance. We will discuss it
scene-by-scene.
You can also refer back to the scenes
to identify parts of theatre-making.

ch-3_theater.indd 38

Note to the Teacher: It is advisable for the students to put
their ideas together and create a script of their own, for the
performance. Using the script in this chapter or a ready script
is not preferred. Doing this would prevent the students from
applying the lessons learnt in Grades 6 and 7 in script writing.

problems. Allow them to make mistakes. Provide
suggestions and tips only when they need help.

Only some points have been listed in this
table. You can add more points for each scene,
as you notice them. It is important to discuss
each scene in your class and analyse the
steps, before creating a complete 30 minute
performance.

Don’t forget the journaling and documentation. It
is an important part of any production. Record using
photos or videos along with written records. This is
done through regular diary entries of your process.

ACTIVITY 3.2: QUIZ TIME
Observe the writing style of the script given in
this chapter. This is the standard style used in the
scripts.
1. Not every line in the script is a dialogue or
a conversation. What are the non-dialogue
lines called? Why are they in the script? How
important are they?

2. How can the reader differentiate between the
dialogue and the non-dialogue lines?

3. Each line said by different characters can be
spoken and expressed in different ways. They
will mean many things based on the intonation,
diction, volume and other styles of dialogue
delivery (learnt in Chapter 1). How does the

script-writer make sure that each line is said in
the intended emotion or style?

4. Note down any other points you may have
noticed when reading the script. Would you like
to write a play of your own?
REMEMBER
Everyone has strengths and
weaknesses. But being aware of
it and making sure your team
is mindful of it throughout the
process will help you enhance
your strengths and reduce your
weaknesses.

Answers:
1. They are called stage instructions. It helps in communicating the actions and visual representation of the scenes.
2. Non-dialogue lines are written in italics and within brackets.
3. The emotion of the line, i.e., to be spoken, is given in italics with brackets immediately after the name of the character.

KEY TAKEAWAYS — LESSONS FOR LIFE
Theatre Motto: The Show Must Go On — Your Superpower for Life!
As students of theatre, this is a line you should never forget. Even if a
crown falls off, someone sneezes loudly, or the lights goes out — actors
don’t stop (like Nandini managed the above play). The audience sitting
in front of you have given you their time (and sometimes money — for
tickets). You owe it to them. It is the responsibility of every theatre
person to make sure that the audience is not disappointed. So, no matter
what happens, they smile, improvise and keep the story alive! That’s the
magic behind ‘The show must go on’.

For you, it is like having a superpower in real life!
When a plan goes wrong, or when you make a
mistake, you don’t have to freeze, panic or quit. Just
take a deep breath, think quick and move forward
like a star. It teaches resilience, adaptability, and
the courage to stay calm even when things don’t
go perfectly. In daily life, challenges, mistakes and
surprises are natural. But just like actors on stage, we
learn to continue with confidence, do our best and

ch-3_theater.indd 43

not give up at the first sign of trouble. It reminds us
that perseverance and a positive attitude are often
more important than perfection. Life is not about
being perfect — it’s about being brave, smart, and
unstoppable, no matter what! Because just like the
show, life goes on!
Here is a real-life story of a show performed in a
school, where the students demonstrated the undying
spirit of theatre —

19-06-2025 15:26:39

In the year 1995, in a town in the Dharwad district of
Karnataka, a team of school students was presenting a
drama production before an audience of more than 200
people in an auditorium. It was an old auditorium with
pulley operated backdrops to depict different scenes
like forest, palace, etc. During the performance, the lead
actor was standing right under the backdrop when the
ropes snapped and the backdrop started falling down,
she heard the sound and noticed the backdrop slipping
down, but did not move or stop her dialogue! She hoped
and trusted the backstage team to do something, and
was determined not to disturb the flow of the play.
Almost as if on cue, two backstage crew members
who noticed this, immediately ran to both sides and held
the ropes by hand. This kept the backdrop in position.
But they couldn’t move as it meant it would fall off, if
they let go. So, they held the heavy backdrop by hand for
one full hour, till the play was completed! What about
the other work they were supposed to do backstage?
The rest of the team came to help and took over their
work, and managed the entire show without a glitch!
The hands of the two crew members were completely
bruised and bleeding. The audience was very happy
with the play and praised the team.
For this reason, the joy and satisfaction of having
completed a show successfully was so high that all the
trouble that the team went through, was forgotten. With
team work and determination — the show went on!

Applause
and Advice

As theatre performers, you
are putting all your effort
(backstage and on stage) to
make sure that the audience
is happy. But as you perform,
you also have certain expectations from the
audience. Don’t you? Some basic behaviour and
understanding of the hard work you have put,
along with some applause and support after the
show.
As you have been told in the previous grades
that watching performances makes you a
better performer, it is now important for you
to understand the responsibility and duty of
being a good member of the audience — for any
performing art.

You will learn

Small distractions from you can disturb the actors
and the other audience.



Applauding at the right time, reacting kindly and
appreciating the effort of the performers.

The above list has very simple requirements on what is
to be done (applaud, appreciate, congratulate, offer help),
and what is not to be done (disrespect the performers
and distract anyone with your actions). This very spirit
is reflected in the 27th chapter of the Nāṭyaśhāstra,
that talks about the success of a performance. The third

When you sit among the audience, you are just as
important as the actors on stage! Your duty is to —

communicated to the performers —

Nāṭyaśhāstra, Ch 27
Of these two, the human (success) has ten
features, and the divine (success) has two; and
these features consist (mostly) of various sattvas
expressed vocally (vānmayī) and physically
(śārīrī).
It mentions that the expression of success can be
in two ways —
1.

Vocally — through words — speech,
exclamations and writing.

2.

Physical body — through actions — clapping,
standing up after the show for respect and giving
gifts.

In this chapter, we shall look at how you can
use the first option — write about the performance
and be a good audience to the arts. The process of
writing a performance for the others to read, and
understand the elements and spirit of the show is
called a ‘review’. As the word itself, it should be so
well-written that the reader should feel like it is being
viewed again. You review the show! Let us look at the
technical definition of a review, which is not limited
to performances alone. Reviews are done for books,
products, paintings, projects and even sports along
with movies, music, drama and dance concerts.
Reviewing is the process
of thoughtfully observing,
reflecting and giving feedback
on a performance, product or
experience. It involves looking
closely at what worked well,
Review
what could be improved and
how effectively the goal was
achieved. Good reviewing is
not just about finding faults. It
is about appreciating strengths, noticing details, and
offering suggestions. It sharpens critical thinking and
helps everyone to improve.

Reviewing in theatre is a special skill where
you not only watch a play but also pay attention
to how well the actors perform, how the story is
told, use of voice, movement, costumes, lighting
and even sets. It is not about criticising. It is about
celebrating what made the performance powerful
and suggesting how it could connect more deeply
with the audience. Theatre reviewing trains you
to be a careful observer, a sensitive listener and a
respectful communicator.
There are three types of reviews —


Self-review — When the creators themselves
examine the art and check for ways to improve
before presenting it to the audience.



Peer review — Contemporaries in the field
provide suggestions, either before or after the
show.



Critical review — It is obtained from everyone
after the show, which includes a detailed
analysis of all the aspects of the performance,
including the scope for improvement,
strengths and weaknesses.

Let us start reviewing!
Being a reviewer does not mean you can just go
and sit in the audience. It is your responsibility to
prepare for it!

ch-4_theater.indd 48

ACTIVITY 4.1: PLAY WATCHING

As theatre students, you not only do theatre but
also watch plays. You learn more by watching. Any
language of any genre. Watch a play whenever
possible. Request your teachers to plan field trips
from school to watch plays together. You can also
watch plays with your family and friends, as a fun
activity. Make sure you write a review for every
performance you watch. The steps given in this
chapter will help you.
The circle time, an activity you have
been doing after every chapter is a
form of review exercise for every
activity!

DO YOU
KNOW?

27-06-2025 15:20:31

Find out the name of the play, playwright
and the basic plot (without spoiling it!).



Go with an open mind — be ready to enjoy
and observe.



Understand the time period or setting, if it
is famous or historical.



A reviewer must be honest but also fair and
respectful. Holding a bias towards the team
or an actor will not make the review honest.

Know the Genre
Is it a comedy, tragedy, musical, historical
drama, or a modern play? This helps you
watch with the right mindset.

Research the Play

Find out about the group performing — are
they professionals,

group? It helps in
understanding their
point of view.

Keep a Journal



Carry a small
notebook to quickly
jot down thoughts
during or right after
the show.

7.

Revise What You Intend to Observe





Acting — Was it believable and emotional?



Lights and Sound — Did they add to the
mood?




Story — Was it clear, engaging or confusing?



Errors that were visibly evident — How
were they handled?

Set design — Did the stage support the story?
Costumes — Did they match the time and
character?

Flow — Is there a smooth flow from one
scene to another? Are the entries and exits
smooth within a scene?

Have No Expectations



Every production is different. Donʼt expect
it to be exactly like a movie or a previous
version you may have seen.

Writing a review
You have watched

points in your
mind, waiting to
be expressed. But
there are some points to keep in mind before you do.

Now, how do you write it?
With all these points in mind, you can start
writing. Though you can make it creative in your
presentation, such that it reflects your unique style,
following a structure will help put things in order
and also making it easy for the readers.

CIRCLE

Donʼt be mean or personal — Critique the
performance, not the person. Never insult an
actor, director or team.

1.

No spoilers — If the story depends on a
surprise, donʼt ruin it for others.

What did you learn about being a performer
after understanding the review process?

2.

Is it easy to review your own work or the
work of others? Which is more important?

3.

Are you able to accept reviews from others
as fairly as you give your reviews to others?

Avoid using single phrases like ‘it was not
bad’ — Explain why you thought it was good or
needed improvement. Justify your opinions.



Have a balance of positives and negatives —
Even if you didn’t enjoy the play, find and
mention something positive too. The main
purpose is to help the team or individuals
improve and do better.



Neither too long nor too short — Find the
balance — detailed but easy to read. Around 300
words is good for beginners.

NOTE TO THE TEACHERS
The students must have noticed that music is an
integral part of our lives, alive in almost every
activity we undertake. They surely feel that musical
traditions which have prevailed in our country deeply
enrich their lives. They realise how people naturally
turn to songs to express themselves during important
moments. Hence, it’s time to let them explore further.
When they listen to a composition or learn a song,
let them delve into its various aspects: theme, author,
beauty of the words or lyrical beauty, different tunes,
and rhythmic patterns that form a song. Point them
towards the diverse voices of singers. There is so
much more to discover. With your motivation they
will uncover the vibrant, enchanting world of swara,
laya and shabd, that surrounds and captivates us all.
Along with the lessons, the assessments should
be scientific, rational and systematic. So, follow the
guidelines for Formative Assessments given at the
end of each chapter, which should be conducted in
a relaxed and engaged manner, and mainly through
observation in the classroom. The suggestions for
Summative Assessments are provided at the end of
the music section. The competencies required for this
stage are given below. The main aim of assessments

ch5_MUSIC.indd 55

is to see whether students are able to reach the
competencies laid out or whether more support is
needed. Give students qualitative feedback at regular
intervals to help them develop further.

Discovering the
Elements of Music

INTRODUCTION

ACTIVITY 5.1: RANGE

Welcome back, students! When we
listen to a piece of music or sing a
song, we observe that it is made of
constituent elements.

Earlier we learnt about the concept of vocal
range, that indicates the span from the lowest
to the highest note you can comfortably sing.
Extending your range is a great way to develop
your singing.
These vocal exercises help you practise the
lower register (mandra saptak) of your voice.
When practising, remember to keep your
head and neck in a neutral position to avoid
straining your voice or throat muscles.

Some of the main elements of music are — melody
(raga), rhythm (tala) and lyrics (sahitya). In this chapter,
we will discover further aspects of rhythm, melody and
lyrics, and observe how they come together when we sing
a song.

ACTIVITY 5.4: SANSKRIT VERSES AND RHYTHM
There are many verses in Sanskrit
composed by various poets and
philosophers. These verses are set in
a particular metre or pattern. This is
referred to as chhandas in Sanskrit. Thus,
while Sanskrit verses are chanted as a
devotional offering, they can also give us
an understanding of rhythm.

Shloka and Chhand (Metre)
Here is a shloka which you can recite in
ʻAnushtup Chhandʼ.

Meaning
(Salutations to him) Who resides in the spiritual heart centre
as omkara, on whom the yogis constantly meditate.
Who grants all desires and also liberation to his devotees.
Salutations to that Shiva, who is represented by syllable ‘Om’.
When you recite these verses a few times, you may observe
that the syllables naturally follow a pattern of 4 which is also
anushtup chhand.
You can even clap your hands while reciting, to understand
the underlying rhythm pattern.

ॐकारं बिं दस

A music ensemble or band is like
a team with many different roles.
Some members will be lead singers,
others will be in the chorus. Some
will play particular instruments.
However, it is important to realise
that each member of the team
is important for a successful
performance.

THE SCIENCE OF SOUND
Vibration
Sound is produced because of
vibrations. When an object vibrates,
it creates sound waves, that
travel through a medium
(air, water, etc.) to reach
our ears.

Resonance

Ringing
Bell

Vibrating Air molecules

Listener

Through resonance, sound is amplified or made louder.
For example, in a percussion instrument, the hollow body
or cavity resonates, amplifying the sound.

sound of a bat

High Frequency

sound of an
elephant

low
Frequency

Timbre
Timbre refers to the ‘tone’ or ‘colour’ of the
sound. Timbre varies with the material used for
the instrument, construction of the instrument
and its playing technique.
Do you think that music is both an art and
science? Discuss in class.

Frequency
Frequency is the number of vibrations per second. A faster
vibration produces higher frequency, resulting in a higher
pitch of sound. For example, tightening the tuning peg
of a Sitar increases its tension and vibrating frequency,
resulting in a higher pitch.

ch6_MUSIC8.indd 66

Different instruments have varied timbre

18-Jun-25 12:28:09 PM

MAKING MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
The makers of musical instruments are essential for the survival
of traditional art forms. Scientific principles are used in the making
of musical instruments.

The instrument maker
works with a log of wood to
create a cylindrical shape.

The head of the
drum is created.

It is then fixed onto
the wooden drum.

Straps are tied to
help with tuning.

Note to the Teacher: Find an instrument maker in your community or local area. Invite them to the school for
a live demonstration of the process of making and maintaining musical instruments. This will give the students a
first-hand idea of the importance of these craftspersons in our society.

MUSICIANS AND THEIR
INSTRUMENTS
Musicians often become synonymous with their
instruments. Here are some great musicians and
their instruments for you to learn about. If you can,
learn about other great musicians from our country!

Annapurna Devi — Surbahar
played the surbahar, a bass sitar known for its deep,
resonant tones. The surbahar was an uncommon
instrument for women as it is considered physically
demanding, but she mastered it and her father
considered her his finest student. Although she did
not perform publicly, Annapurna Devi was known for
her commitment to tradition and her mastery over
ragas. Her students, including flautist Hariprasad
Chaurasia and sitarist Nikhil Banerjee, became some
of the most acclaimed musicians of their generation.
Annapurna Devi (1927 – 2018), born Roshanara Khan,
was one of the most influential figures in Indian
classical music. She was the daughter of the legendary
Baba Allauddin Khan of the Maihar Gharana and

ch6_MUSIC8.indd 68

About the Surbahar: The surbahar is a plucked

string instrument, often called the ‘bass sitar’, used
in Hindustani classical music. It has a deeper and
lower tonal range than the sitar, making it suitable
for elaborate alaap sections.

18-Jun-25 12:28:12 PM

Pannalal ghosh — flute
Pannalal
Ghosh
lived from 1911 to
1960 and his name
was
synonymous
to
Indian
flute
(bansuri). He was a
bansuri player and
also a composer.
He was a disciple
of Baba Allauddin Khan, and is credited with
popularising the flute as a concert instrument in
Hindustani classical music. As a child he had picked
up a small flute that cowherders usually played and
on the basis of the education he was receiving on the
sitar from his father, he would try to play musical
patterns on the flute. At the age of 18, he started
focusing his attention on the flute. Ghosh realised
that a bigger flute’s pitch and sonority would be more
appropriate for both classical and light music. Ghosh
experimented with various materials including
metal and different types of wood, and decided on
using bamboo. He finally settled on a flute which was
32 inches long.
He assisted in music production while he was in
Calcutta working with New Theatres Ltd. In 1940

he came to Bombay, to further expand his music
career. Sneh Bandhan (1940) was his debut film as
an independent music composer. The popular songs
from the film were “Aabroo Ke Kamaanon Mein”
and “Sneh Bandhan Mein Bandhe Hue” sung by Khan
Mastan and Bibbo. Pannalal Ghosh jointly scored the
background for “Aandhiyan” in 1952 along with Ustad
Ali Akbar Khan and Pandit Ravi Shankar. He was the
first to introduce the seven-hole flute.

Mysore Doraiswamy Iyengar — Veena
Doraiswamy Iyengar was born into a family of
renowned Carnatic musicians in 1920. His father
Venkatesh Iyengar served as a Court musician at the
Royal court of Mysore, who was efficient equally in
flute and Veena. Iyengar started learning the Veena
from his father at an early age of 6 years and later
went to become the disciple
of Veena Venkatagiriyappa.
Later, he developed a
distinctive style of playing
the Veena often referred
to as the Mysore Bani. He
spent his early years in
the village Gaddavalli in
Hassan district, Karnataka.

He was nominated for Asthana Vidvan (Royal
musician of the court) of the Mysore court, one to
receive this honour very young age. Apart from giving
performances, he was engaged in imparting musical
knowledge to the members of the royal family.
He was appointed as the Music Director at the
All India Radio in Bangalore. He was credited with
several awards and titles. The University of Mysore

conferred upon him an Honorary Doctorate in 1975,
the Prestigious civilian award the Padma Bhushan
by the President of India in 1983, the Sangeetha
Kalanidhi of the Madras Music Academy in 1984, the
Sangeetha Kalasikhamani of the Indian Fine Arts
Society Chennai in 1994, the Sangeetha Kalaratna
of the Bangalore Gayana Samaj, and the Chowdiah
National Memorial Award.

RAAG ASAVARI

Raag Asavari Lakshan Geet Teentala

This raga is originated from asavari thaat. In this
raga, the notes — gandhar, dhaivat and nishad — are
komal, and the remaining notes are shudh. Its vaadi
note is ‘dhaivat’ and the samvaadi note is ‘gandhar’.
The ‘gandhar’ and ‘nishad’ are missing notes in aroh
(ascending order), due to which the jathi of this raga
is audav-sampoorna. The singing time of this raga is
the second quarter of the day. A raga similar to this
is jaunpuri.

Note to the Teacher: Have you listened to the programme Sangita Sarita? Listen to it and you will get multiple
ideas of how music is connected with different aspects of life. Try listening to music related to the above ragas
through concert, your acquaintances, or any other internet resource. As you hear ragas performed by different
artists, you will be able to understand the depth in each ragas.

BHAKTI SANGEET AND SUFI QAWWALI
Devotional music in India has its roots
in the Bhakti movement, a significant
religious, social and literary movement
that swept across India beginning from
the 6th century CE, and reaching its
peak during the 15th – 17th century CE. It led
to a spiritual revival emphasising devotion,
and significantly influenced Indian music,
leading to the creation of new musical forms
like kirtanas and bhajans. Some prominent
bhakti poets include Mirabai and Tulsidas
in northern India, and Haridasa saints like
Purandara Dasa and Kanakadasa in the
southern India.
Similarly, Sufism is a mystical dimension
of Islam that emerged around the medieval
period in India. Sufi saints like Khwaja
Moinuddin Chishti and Baba Farid focused
on inner devotion and spiritual experience
as a means of connecting with god. The
Sufi Qawwali genre of music arose from
this philosophy and continues to be widely
practised and performed, especially in
Punjab and the western regions of India.

INSPIRATION
AND IMAGINATION

INSPIRING ARTISTS
We
may
assume
that
musicians and artists are
born with a natural talent or
gift, and that they are lucky
to be on stage and perform in front of people. But,
many musicians had to overcome a disability or
a difficult circumstance in their lives to achieve
success.

ch8_MUSIC.indd 88

Vaidyanathan and Puttaraj Gawai.
 Find out more about the artist including —

Ravindra Jain (1944 – 2015)

•

Where they are from?

Ravindra Jain was a well-known
music composer and songwriter,
who mainly worked in Hindi
films. Despite being blind, he
became one of India’s most loved
musicians. He composed music for
more than 200 Bollywood films,
and also composed music for the
popular television series, Ramayan. Ravindra Jain
won the Filmfare award for Best Music Director for
Ram Teri Ganga Maili (1985), and also performed
in hundreds of live and TV shows.

MUSICAL PILLARS
Indian temples have a tradition of
musical pillars. Due to the material
of the stone and the precise
carving of the pillar, they produce
musical notes when struck, which
is indeed a marvelous coming
together of music, science and
sculpture.
1.

Airavateshwara temple, Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu

Vijaya Vittala Temple,
Hampi, Karnataka
Features: 56 pillars that
produce musical notes.

2.

Airavateshwara temple,
Darasuram, Tamil Nadu
Features: A stone staircase
that produces different notes
when tapped.

3.

Features: Carved stone,
Kerala pillars that produces
musical notes when struck.

The pillars are made of resonant stone that vibrate at clearly audible
frequencies.
They are often hollow and have varying densities, allowing different
frequencies to be produced.

How do these pillars work?

IMAGINING MY FUTURE

ACTIVITY 8.3: REPORT ON YOUR FUTURE SELF

Over this year, we have explored a lot of different
ideas about the elements of music, instruments,
songs and emotions. We have also been inspired
by the lives of musicians and legends. You can
be successful too, with focus and dedication,
and contribute to building a stronger nation.
Let us spend some time imagining your future.

Write a newspaper article about yourself (in the third
person point of view), twenty years from now. Before
you start writing, think and note down points for the
following:
Whatever career you have selected;
 What are some of your major accomplishments?
 Contribution of music or any other art form in your
personal life.
 What is the milestone event you would like to report?
 What do you like to do at present?
 Any other interesting details about your personal
life.
 Your future dreams.
If you need some inspiration, look at the biographies
and achievements of the people you admire. Remember,
you have the power to make this world a better place.
Create a draft using these points, and then, think of
an eye-catching headline. Write a final article of 400–500
words in length, and post it on your class notice board.

may evolve in the future. If you prefer a podcast, a short
form video, or a blog to a newspaper article, try one of
those formats.

ACTIVITY 8.4: MUSICAL AUTOBIOGRAPHY
A musical autobiography uses music to tell the story
of one’s life. To do this activity, follow these steps:
Think about your life so far, and note down some
important details you want to share, like where
you were born, something about your family, the
interesting things you have done, your hobbies, and
anything else you want people to know about you.
For each of these details, identify a piece of music

that represents what you would like to convey. Write
a few sentences on why this song is relevant to your
autobiography. Share the songs and descriptions with
the class.

My World
of Music

How do you relate to music
in your life? Today, music
is found in a variety of
contexts and situations —
from reinterpretations of
traditional songs, to the
latest advertisement or anthem, music is
everywhere. Let us explore some of these diverse
contexts of music. Shall we start with singing
some popular songs?

ACTIVITY 9.1
Nimbooda Nimbooda
Nimbooda nimbooda is a traditional Rajasthani
folk song, performed by the Langa and Manganiar
musicians. Such songs have been used in films and
have gained immense popularity.

TRADITIONAL MUSIC IN
POPULAR CULTURE
There are many examples of traditional music,
both folk and devotional, that have found their
way into popular culture and have been adapted
into films or pop music. This helps the music
reach a new audience of people who can also
enjoy it.
Two examples of songs that are traditional in
nature and have become very popular are given
on next page.

MEANING
The Kashmiri song ‘Rind posh maal’ describes the
landscape of Kashmir, which has the beautiful lake,
forest, trees, flowers, mountains, etc. The landscape
is described to make everyone appreciate and know
about its beauty.

APPLICATIONS OF MUSIC
Music has an important place in advertisements,
sporting events and more.
Have you heard songs written about products in
advertisements? These are known as jingles, and are
meant to be catchy for people to remember brands
and products.
Name some popular jingles that you remember.

Major sporting events like Khelo India and the
Olympics also have their signature tunes, and theme
songs. These tunes and songs help create a feeling of
community among the people attending the events.
List out some sporting events which have theme

songs and tunes that you may remember. You can
pick an issue or a campaign of national importance.

In movies, in addition to the background score
and songs, sometimes you will hear a particular
theme being played whenever a specific character
appears. This is put in movies to highlight the actions
or presence of the particular protagonist.

ACTIVITY 9.2: CREATE A JINGLE
 Choose a product. It could be something you
use everyday.
 What are some features of the product that
make it attractive for others to buy it?
 Using these features, write a few lines which
will be the lyrics for your jingle.
 Set your words to a tune or rhythm, and feel
free to add sound effects.
 Share your 15–30 second jingle with the class.
 As an additional activity, you can draw an
advertisement poster for your product, using
the tag line from your jingle.

MUSIC AND CLIMATE CHANGE
Today, climate change and global warming are
threatening to cause irreversible damage to humans,
and the planet. We must all take steps at individual
and collective level in our own way to preserve
the environment from further damage. One way to
spread more awareness about the importance of
the natural world with plants, animals and birds, is
through music.
The Clean Ganga movement is a project
undertaken by the Government of India to restore
and revitalise the Ganga river. A theme song of this
movement, ‘Namami Gange’ is available online. You
can find it and listen.

ch9_MUSIC.indd 98

ACTIVITY 9.3: WRITE A SONG FOR CHANGE
 Divide your class into groups of 5–6 students
each.
 Choose a nationally important issue or
campaign, such as swach bharat, clean ganga,
beti bachao beti padhao, etc.
 Now, you can write an anthem for the chosen
movement. Here are some ideas on how you
could go about it.
•

First, write down some of the key points you
would like to express through the song.

•

Find a chorus or hook line that encapsulates
the message of the song.

•

Write two verses that explore the theme.

•

You can first think of a tune and then, write
lyrics to the tune, or write the lyrics first and
then, set it to tune.

•

Work on refining the song.

•

Share it with your friends in class and
if possible, present it during the school
assembly.

We have explored several facets of music and how
they are created. Some of you may enjoy music. If this
is so, have you wondered how you could continue to
work with music as a career? You may be surprised
to know that besides being a singer or an instrument
player, there are many different careers in music.
Some of them are discussed below.

CAREERS IN MUSIC OR OPTIONS
TO MAKE MUSIC A PART OF YOUR
LIFE
1. Sound engineer
A sound engineer, also
known as an audio
engineer, is responsible
for recording, mixing
and reproducing sound
for live performances,
and recordings. They
use audio equipment like microphones, speakers and
mixing consoles to ensure good quality of the sound.

2. Music producer
A music producer helps artists record their songs,
album or project. Music producers bring an artist’s

vision to life. It is the music producer’s job to ensure
that the finished product is good, and to see that
the artist’s plan for the album or song is carried out
successfully.

3. Event manager
An event curator or manager puts together one or
more aspects of a live concert, including contacting
and selecting artists to perform, promoting the
event, earning revenue through ticket sales and
sponsorships, and ensuring all the requirements for
the concert, such as venue, sound, lights, etc., are in
place.

4. Music therapist
Music therapists are professionals who use music as
a tool to relieve pain, manage stress, support mental
health and rehabilitation
for their patients or
clients. Depending on
the treatment needs,
a music therapist may
be required to create
music, or select and play
appropriate songs or
ragas, as well as engage

their clients in active listening and responding to
music. Music therapy is a growing area, with many
research experiments being conducted. It lies at the
intersection of music, science and medicine.

5. Music educator
Music educators teach music to students at
different places, such as schools, universities, music
conservatories or online. Some may teach music to
groups of students or a choir at a school, while others
may teach select students individually. Sometimes
A music class of parents and teachers

music educators use songs to teach concepts of maths
and science. To be a music educator or teacher, you
must have good knowledge and training in music,
and also enjoy interacting with people.

ACTIVITY 9.4: RESEARCH CAREERS IN MUSIC
Do you know of any other career options in music?
Research ‘careers in music’ online. Pick one career,
and write a few lines about what the job involves
and share your perspectives with your class.

ch9_MUSIC.indd 100

19-06-2025 17:24:57

ACTIVITY 9.5: BEHIND THE SCENES

ACTIVITY 9.6: EVENT PROMOTION

Do you know a grown up who has a job
in music?
Speak to them and understand what
their typical day looks like.
If possible, ask them if you could join
them for a half day, when they are
working and understand what their
work is like.
Share what you learnt with your
friends and teacher in class.
Would you like a career in music?
Reflect and share it with your friends.

Learn
about
how
events are organised or
promoted by volunteering
to help a local musician
or music presenter in an
event.
Consider the stages to
organise and plan an event,
and refer to your Grade 7
music textbook if needed.
Identify the musician or
organiser you would like to
volunteer and approach them with the permission of your school.
While designing a promotional plan, think of how you can
collect information — how can you spread word about the event
in a way that would be interesting to people of your age? Consider
online, and offline promotion, hyperlocal communication or even
a contest to create interest. Submit your promotion plan to your
teacher and the musician or organiser you are volunteering with
for approval.
Ask if you can help and learn about the other aspects of the
performance, whether it is ticketing, stage design, light, sound or
other activities.
Document the process and performance, and share your
report with the class.

INNER DYNAMICS
OF DANCE

Breath in Dance
According to yogic philosophy,
the word ‘prāna’ refers to the
vital breath of life. The flow
of breath that occurs during
inhalation and exhalation is known as prānāyama.
Dance is also fuelled by this life force, prāna.
Dance movements begin with the equipoise,
i.e., a relaxed spine. Breathing helps to relax
the body, especially the spine, which enables the
body to move with maximum agility and stability.
Breathing forms the link between two seamless dance
movements.
Breath plays a significant role in physical dance
movements and also while conveying emotions.
In dance, the body stretches, bends and expands
better with an inhale, just like in yoga āsanās.
When it contracts, it does so with an exhale.
While holding a static posture, relaxing through
the breath and focusing on elongating the spine
help to balance and hold the position for longer.

ACTIVITY 10.1: BREATHING IN STILLNESS AND MOTION
 Divide yourselves into four groups.
 Each group will hold a dance posture
practised in earlier classes. Observe the
flow of breath through the movement of
your spine.

 Then, work out a movement with

expansion of the body — for instance,
arms outstretched, body bending,
elongated movements of the feet while
observe how breathing in helps the body.

 Next, shift into another movement

where there is body contraction,
such as crouching the body in fear or
nervousness, and breathe out while
doing it.

 Finish it with another static posture with
a relaxed breath.

 Once each group finishes presenting

their movement pattern, discuss how
breathing worked for both stillness and
movements.

2. Elements of Dance
Dance is a combination of being static and dynamic.
There is a moment of stillness in postures and then,
there is motion in movement.
Fundamentally, if you look at any movement — it
starts and ends with a static posture. If you are
walking from Point A to Point B, there will be a
moment of stillness before you set off from Point A,
and after you land at Point B. In between the two is
the movement.

History Trivia

The postures and movements are described in various dance
texts, and each dance text offers their unique interpretation
and terminology.
The Nāṭyaśhāstra calls postures sthāna and ways of
moving as chāri, gati and mandala.
The Sangīta Ratnākara (ocean of sangita) gives us more
variations of the same and includes regional variations, deshi.
The Abhinaya Darpaṇam (mirror of gestures) calls postures
— sthānaka and mandala, and depict ways of moving as chāri
and gati.

ch10_DANCE.indd 110

The Nāṭyaśhāstra was written by Bharata Muni
in the 5th century BCE. It is the oldest and most
authoritative text on dance, and dance-drama. It is
the first written record which discusses all aspects
of performing arts. Bharata’s Nāṭyaśhāstra was
included in United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Memory of
World Register in 2025.
The Sangīta Ratnākara was written by
Sharangadeva around the 12th century CE.
Sangeeta is a composite term meaning vocal
music, instrumental music and dance. This text is
special because it is one of the first texts with an
independent chapter on dance. The text follows
the nāṭyaśhāstra in all its uniform stylisations,
which is called mārgī and also describes various
regional variations, which is called deśhī.
The Abhinaya Darpanam, written by
Nandikeshwara around the same time as Sangita
Ratnakara was the first book exclusively on
dance. Even today, many dance styles continue to
refer this text.

According to Nāṭyaśhāstra, sthānas are of three types —
standing, sitting and reclining postures.

4. Motion in Dance
Motion in dance is a very exciting concept where one
can use various levels of postures, speeds, extensions,
leaps and pirouettes to move from one place to
another. This can depend on the mood and the feel of
the character, the patterns of the choreography (like
circular or linear), or the action being shown, etc.
There are innumerable ways of moving in dance.
As mentioned earlier, each text gives us many
variations.
 According to Nāṭyaśhāstra,

Chāris are of two types — bhaumi chāris
which are earthly movements, where the
feet don’t leave the ground; and ākāshi
chāris which are aerial movements where
the feet leave the ground. A combination of
chāris makes a mandala.
Think about different ways of moving where your
feet are stuck to the ground like dragging your feet,
and then think about ways where your feet leave the
ground, like leaps, jumps, etc.

Gati refers to movements and walks suitable
for various characters in the play.
Think about how different characters walk, like a
soldier, a baby, a bear, a monkey.

ch10_DANCE.indd 116

If you examine your regional dance style, you
will notice some forms have repetitive steps,
where they move in a particular pattern.
For instance, the tippani dance from Gujarat
is done while pounding spices — they use their
tool (the stick) as a prop and move with small
jumps in a circular or linear pattern.
What makes it interesting is that it is not
just the dancers who move but the whole group
moves together, the sticks move rhythmically,
and even the song changes speed, starting
slowly and gradually becoming faster.

19-06-2025 16:28:29

 According to the Abhinaya Darpanam,


Chāri refers to different ways of moving or
displacing yourself. It is derived from the
word ‘chāra,’ which means to move.

Examples of chÃri
(from Abhinaya Darpanam)



Gati is a characteristic gait like that of an animal.
The dancer embodies the way the animal would
move. This can either be used to depict the
animal or the characteristics of the animal.

Examples of gati
(from Abhinaya Darpanam)

1. Chalana — simple
walking steps
2. Veginī — quick steps
3. Saraṇam — wide steps
4. Kuṭṭanam — thumping
steps
Veginī — quick steps

Kuṭṭanam — thumping steps

Kuṭṭanam — thumping steps

Deer step — quick,
high-leaping movement

Monkey step — strong
steps and jumps

Tiger step — powerful weighted

Garuda (bird) — light and airy jump

Think about the dance styles in your region
and observe the different ways in which
they move.
For instance, in Kathakali from Kerala, the sides of
the feet are used in a thumping step (chāri).
In Seraikella Chhau from Jharkhand, the dance
has many walks inspired by animals, like the lion,
peacock, duck, deer, bear, goat, crocodile, etc., (gati).

ACTIVITY 10.4: SPIRIT OF MOVEMENTS
 Arrange yourselves into two groups.
 One group can take
the various human
characters like a king,
queen, hunter, soldiers,
villagers, etc.

 The other group can

take the various animal
characters like a lion,
elephant, deer, peacock,
snake, etc.

 While creating your movement, think

about the speed, levels of emotions of the
character.

 Create through a dance scene, interaction

between the human and animal characters
and perform it in the class.

Note to the Teacher: Teacher can play
some background music suitable to the
storyline.

Movements
A complete dance movement phrase is created with postures
and movements, which are combined with movements of
the arms and hand gestures.
The Nāṭyaśhāstra describes this coordinated movement
of hands and feet as a karana, and describes 108 such
karanas.
You may have seen some bronze statues of dancing
Shiva — the image is one such moment captured from the
Bhujaṅgatrasita karaṇa no. 24 from the Nāṭyaśhāstra.

ACTIVITY 10.5: DANCING FROM HEAD TO TOE
 Arrange yourselves into four groups.
 As a group, create a short sequence

that includes:
One static posture (sthāna),
One movement of the lower limbs (chari
or gati),
Arm movements and hand gestures (hastas).

Optional: Include other body movements,
such as from the hips, neck, sides, or head
drawing on what you have already learned.
Conclude your sequence by returning to a
moment of stillness.

 Breath Awareness: As you move, pay attention
to your breath.
Inhale gently when the body expands
or rises.
Exhale smoothly as the body releases
or grounds.
In stillness, let the breath settle — calm,
relaxed, and effortless.

 Let your breath guide the rhythm of your
movement and return to stillness.

PAN INDIAN
DANCE FORMS

Dances are a beautiful part of India’s
cultural heritage and history!
There are eight major dance
forms of India —

1. Bharatanatyam
2. Kathak
3. Kathakali
4. Kuchipudi
5. Manipuri
6. Mohiniyattam
7. Odissi
8. Sattriya

Dancers depicting different styles of major dance forms

ch11_DANCE.indd 122

bharatanatyam is a dance from Tamil Nadu,
in South India. It is known for its geometric
and graceful movements, strong footwork, and
beautiful hand gestures and facial expressions.
The dancers tell stories using emotions, music
and rhythm. Among the many traditions (bāṇis)
of Bharatanatyam, the Thanjavur, Pandanallur,
Vazhuvoor, and Mysuru styles are especially
well-known, though numerous other bāṇis also
contribute richly to the form. The dancers stand
in a special half-sitting position called aramandi
or ayatamandala, shaped like a diamond.

19-06-2025 16:30:26

They wear colourful silk sarees with pleats in front
that spread out beautifully as they dance, along with
traditional temple jewellery.

Kathak, which means storytelling, is a dance
form from northern India, particularly rooted in
the regions of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Kathak
evolved as a form of storytelling through expressive
gestures, intricate footwork and graceful movements.
Dancers captivate audiences with swift spins,
rhythmic foot stamping, delicate hand gestures, and
nuanced facial expressions to bring stories to life.
Among the many gharanas of kathak the Lucknow,
Jaipur, Banaras, Raigarh styles are particularly
renowned though several other gharanas have also
shaped and enriched the form. They stand tall in a
posture called sama sthana, with feet together or in a
slight v-shape. The costumes are usually long, flowing
dresses like anarkalis or lehengas, with dupattas
made from fabrics typical to northern India.

Kathakali is a traditional dance from Kerala,
primarily performed by men. It is like a colourful
play, where dancers act out stories from Indian epics
using stylised facial expressions, hand gestures and
body movements. There are two styles the northern
style known as vadakkan and the southern style
known as thekkan. The basic stance in kathakali is
atimandala — a deep, grounded posture with knees
bent outward and feet placed on the side-foot firmly
planted apart. The dancers wear bright costumes, big
crowns, and heavy makeup. Their faces are painted
in colours that match their characters, like green for
heroes, red for villains, etc. Every part of the face is
used to convey emotion, while the dance is full of
powerful poses and eye movements.

ch11_DANCE.indd 124

Kuchipudi, from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana,
derives its name from the village of Kuchipudi,
which remains home to several traditional dance
families even today, such as the Vempati, Vedantam,
Bhagavatula of Pasumarthy, among others, who have
preserved and passed down this rich legacy through
generations. It follows a rich dance-drama tradition
and is distinctive for its integration of vachika
abhinaya (spoken word) along with an expressive
dance. Often theatrical in nature, it includes elements
of acting; and at times, dancers perform intricate
sequences on a brass plate, showcasing remarkable
balance and skill.
Traditionally, it was performed exclusively by
men, who often portrayed both male and female
roles in the dance-dramas.
The basic stance is similar to
Bharatanatyam’s aramandi,
but is less deep. The dance
is distinctive for its quickfootedness, hip movements,
leaps, sculpturesque poses
and speed. The dancers wear
silk fabrics stitched for easy
movement, with a special
drape called gochi kattu.
They also wear traditional
temple jewellery.

19-06-2025 16:30:34

Manipuri is a classical dance from Manipur in NorthEast India. This dance form is soft, gentle and flowing. The
movements are smooth and round, almost like gliding. The
dancers always look calm and peaceful. The dance includes
raas leela (stories of Krishna) and traditional movements
from Lai Haraoba. Manipuri dance also includes Sankirtan,
a devotional music and dance form performed with cymbals
and drums, often as part of temple rituals. A special dance
called pung cholom involves playing a drum while dancing,
showing excellent skill and coordination. Dancers usually
keep their feet together and move circularly with no hard
stamping. The famous costume is the poloi dress — a stiff,
colourful skirt with a veil and elegant jewellery. The men
wear white dhotis and turbans, especially during pung
cholom or raas performances.

Mohiniyattam is a graceful dance from
Kerala that was originally performed only by
women. It is soft, flowing, and full of expression
and devotion. The dance uses gentle movements
of the upper body, and delicate steps to create
a graceful and lyrical style. There are two
major dance traditions, kalamandalam and
kalyanikutty amma. Dancers change levels
between the low and medium positions like
aramandala, chaturmandala and atimandala.
They wear beautiful white or cream sarees with
golden borders called kasavu, and traditional
jewellery.

Odissi, dance form originates from
Odisha in eastern India. Various sculptural
postures from the temples of Odisha are
depicted in this dance form. The dance is
smooth and flowing, with slow turns and
graceful steps. This form has been derived
from Maharis ― Devadasis of Odisha and
Gotipua ― group of boy dancers, dressed
as girls who dance for
Lord Vishnu. A special
feature is the tribhanga
pose, where the body
bends in three places
the head, torso, and hip.
Dancers often stand in
a square-shaped and
half-sitting pose called
chauka. Costumes are
made from traditional
fabrics called pattasari
(silk) with step fanshaped pleats and
beautiful silver filigree
jewellery and a flowerlike headpiece called
tahiya.

ch11_DANCE.indd 126

Sattriya comes from Assam and was first performed in
monasteries called sattras. It combines strong and gentle
movements, and tells stories through realistic actions, like
eating, fighting or showing love. Dancers use their upper
body for expression and the lower body for rhythm. It was
originally performed by male monks called bhokots, but was
later opened to women and the general public. The dance
includes group patterns like sarpa and performances, such
as the sutradhari dance and gopir nach. Dancers train in
sixty-four basic exercises called mati-akhora. Costumes are
made from Assamese silk called pat, with traditional local
designs and ornaments often with a dhoti or skirt, similar to what
monks used to wear. There are two main postures — purusha
(male) and prakriti (female).

Other Dance Traditions
Apart from the eight major dance forms, there are
various other folk dance forms across India. Beliefs,
rituals, performing arts, and the symbolism of
communities take root in specific social contexts and
locations. They bring colour into the monotonous
activities of daily life. Born and nurtured in a specific
socio-cultural context, each artistic form has its
own myth and history. Though folk traditions have
changed over time, their basic elasticity has helped
adapt to industrialisations and urbanisations.
Dance forms from two regions — Nagaland and
Chattisgarh, and their important personalities are
given below.

mangkotepsu. The Sumi tribe performs the energetic
Sumi war dance to celebrate victory in battle, while
the Lotha women perform the mungyanta, a harvest
dance during the Tokhu Emone festival. Nagaland is
home to around 30 traditional dances, including the
Sangtam War Dance, Hornbill Dance, Chang Lo and
Butterfly Dance, each reflecting the cultural richness
of its many indigenous communities.
One of the important persons who has contributed
a lot to the dances of the community is Sangyusang
Pongen of the Ao community. He received the Sangeet
Natak Akademi Award for his contribution.

The Ao Naga tribe from the northeastern part of
Nagaland celebrates the Moatsu Mong festival as
a time of recreation and joy, after the hard work of
clearing fields, burning jungles, and sowing seeds. It is
marked by vibrant songs, dances and merrymaking.
Another major festival, Tsungrem Mong, is observed
on the eve of the harvest to offer gratitude to the
Supreme Power, with colourful costumes, songs
and dances. The Ao Naga have a rich tradition of
clothing that distinguishes between commoners
and warriors, with the Ao warrior known as

culture, with diverse dances that
reflect its unique heritage and close
connection to nature. These dances are
typically performed during festivals,
harvests and rituals. The panthi dance,
popular among the Satnami community
of Chhattisgarh, features groups of
men dancing in formations to the
beats of the mandar drum and jhanjh.
The gaud maria dance, from the BisonHorn Maria community in the Bastar
plateau, is performed by both men and
women, during occasions like births
and marriages. Other notable dances
include the Karma dance, performed to
honour Karma Devi during the harvest;
the suwa danda or parrot dance,
performed by women during harvest
and Diwali; and the gedi dance of the
Gond people, performed on bamboo
stilts. The region boasts many vibrant

Communicating through Dance
You may recall the various hand gestures you learnt
in the previous grades. Each gesture can have a
meaning or many meanings and can help you
communicate and even tell a story!
Gestures of a single hand are called asamyuta
hastas and gestures of both hands are called samyuta
hastas.
Let us take this learning a step further.
The Abhinaya Darpaṇam mentions these hastas
in Sanskrit shlokas.
Asamyuta Hasta is a Shloka describing 28 singlehand gestures. Additionaly, there are 4 more hand
gestures.

Exploring Hastas as a Sign Language

Mohiniattam

Before there was any language, people
communicated using sign language and
gestures. Even today, when you watch
dances, you will notice how music and dance
are used to share thoughts and feelings.
You have learnt that hastas can be
used for communication. Now, observe
around yourself and notice how some
people naturally use hand gestures while
conversing. Do you recognise those gestures?
Try to create a sign language using some
of the hastas that you have learnt and
prepare a chart.

ACTIVITY 12.2: THE LANGUAGE
OF SILENCE
(a) In Storytelling
 Divide the class into 4 groups.
 Brainstorm a few situations with
various characters. Each group
will choose a different situation.
For example: A busy road with
police officers, cars and pedestrians;
a family gearing up to celebrate a
festival; a group of friends going
camping or playing an outdoor
sport; a group of people farming and
ploughing land.
 Use
appropriate
hastas
expressions to enact the situation
without words, and present it in
front of the class.
 This activity is similar to the mime
work done in Theatre, Grade 7
textbook, but here the focus is
on making it more stylised and
rooted in dance vocabulary.

(b) In Communication
 Divide yourselves into 4 groups.

 Enact them using only hastas and no voice to
see if they communicate the idea clearly.

 Brainstorm two sentences that you may use
every day, either in class or at home.

 This communication could be added to your
sign language chart.

Note to the Teacher: Refer to the hasta usage as taught in the previous grades. The teacher should play
appropriate music.

Expressing Emotions
through Dance
Have you ever wondered why, when you watch an
emotional performance, sometimes you also tear up?
Or when you watch something beautiful, you cannot
stop smiling or feeling happy? It is because the
emotion of sadness or joy which is being expressed by
the dancer is so powerful, that it touches your heart.
In Grade 7, you have learnt about the resultant
experience (rasa) of a feeling or emotion (bhāva).
Now, it’s time to try to express emotions (bhāva)
through dance. Bhāva is the first thought, the instant
feeling you get when something happens.
Sometimes, experiencing emotions is healing
because our deep emotions find an outlet. Think
about that one movie, song or dance performance,
that made you feel something strongly. It could be an
emotion of patriotism, happiness or even sorrow.
ACTIVITY 12.4: DANCE OF MOTIVATION (UTSĀHA BHĀVA)
Choose a song based on patriotism and choreograph
a dance.
Note to the Teacher: Teacher may play appropriate
music.

ch12_DANCE.indd 138

Now, let’s focus on your own feelings — your
bhavas. Remember in Chapter 1, you learnt
briefly about how breath can also help in
expressing emotions.
Think about what happens when you are
scared — you start breathing rapidly with
shallow breaths, which causes your body
to express fear in many ways, such as
perspiration, trembling and loss of facial
colour. It is breath that helps in expressing
those emotions clearly.

Fear
Trembling

Loss of
facial colour

19-06-2025 17:27:49

Breath itself can be a powerful form of expression,
for example, a heavy exhale or sigh to show
disappointment.
In theatre, this same emotion would be expressed
differently, whereas in dance it would be more
stylised, more deliberate. In dance, the entire body,
including facial expressions along with the breath,
form a way to express your emotions.
That is the beauty of the arts; while interconnected,
each form has its own distinct language and
mode of expression.

Bhawai Dance from Rajasthan

Moving from the feeling of disappointment to
joy — how would dance express it?
For instance, kolatam from Tamil Nadu or dandiya
from Gujarat, express the joy or happiness within,
complemented with a smiling face. Even more
complex movements of Kuchipudi and Odissi may
show you the same joy and happiness!

Nati Dance from Himachal Pradesh

Dance is one of the best forms of self-expression! If
you have to express the eight emotions from everyday
life, how would you express them?

140 | KRITI

ACTIVITY 12.5: DANCE TO EXPRESS THE EIGHT EMOTIONS
Recall a recent moment that made
you feel loved, stay with that feeling
and share that beautiful feeling with
your friends.
This is rati bhāva leading to
shringāra rasa.
Did you laugh a lot at something you
watched or read recently? Recreate
that situation and make your friends
laugh.
This is hāsa bhāva leading to
hāsya rasa.
Everyone has some sad moments in
life that we choose not to think about.
But select one such incident, express
it to a confidante and see if that makes
you feel any better.
This is shoka bhāva leading to
karuna rasa.
Anger can be a dangerous emotion,
especially when let out on another
person. Think about that one thing
that angers you and use a dance
movement to vent out that anger.
This is krodha bhāva leading to
raudra rasa.

ch12_DANCE.indd 140

Did you do something that was very brave
and required immense courage? Share this
moment as a dance with your friends.
This is utsāha bhāva leading to veera
rasa.
If you were scared, how would you react?
Enact that fear with expressions and hand
gestures.
This is bhaya bhāva leading to
bhayānaka rasa.
Surely something disgusted you recently.
What was your instant reaction to that
moment? Recreate it.
This is jugupsa bhāva leading to
bibhatsa rasa.
When did you feel and say, “Oh how
amazing!”? Grab a friend or a group of
friends together to show that amazement
and wonder.
This is vismaya bhāva leading to
adbhuta rasa.
Now, collectively look at the concepts we have discussed
from Chapter 1 — breath, postures, movement of the
feet and arms, hand gestures, emotions, and see how
you can bring them all together to express bhavas in
the next activity.

19-06-2025 17:27:54

ACTIVITY 12.6: DANCE FROM THE HEART
 Divide yourselves into two groups.
 Take turns, one group performs, while the other group
observes. Then switch roles.
 Each group will choose a mood or emotion from the
eight emotions that you have learnt.
 Play a music piece or a song which represents that mood.
 Then close your eyes and imagine something that makes
you feel that emotion.
 With eyes closed, let your body respond to that emotion
naturally.

After both groups finish, the teacher should
play meditative music and all students should
relax, sit down holding the chin mudra and
breathe, focusing on a feeling of peace and
contentment — This is Nirveda Bhāva leading
to Shānta Rasa.
Think about how you felt while doing
this activity? Maybe you can use this process
when something upsets you?
Think about how you felt while watching
this activity? Could you connect to the
emotions that were being shown?

 Then open your eyes, discuss with your group how you
would like to express the emotion and choose a situation.
 Create a group dance expressing this situation using
expression, hand gestures, postures, movements,
breath, etc.
 Remember to continue feeling what you felt when you
had your eyes closed.
Note to the Teacher: The teacher will play appropriate
music for various emotions for both activities.

Often times, when you are able to
release your feelings, that sense of
relief is an experience of emotional
healing. When you watch and relate
to an emotion which is being shown,
you experience empathy.
Dance heals both physically and
emotionally. For instance, the head
and neck movements (refer to Grade 4
textbook) are used to cure spondylitis,
the eye movements (refer to Grade
5 textbook) are used to increase eye
power. These are common exercises
that are practised daily by dancers.
Dance movement therapy, healing
through dance, and dance and wellness
are careers in which dance helps in
emotional well-being. Psychologists and
physiotherapists use movement as a
form of therapy.
The performance of Poothana
Moksham or Surpanakha scenes are
pleasing to people of varied tastes
and diverse expectations.

INNOVATION, INCLUSIVITY AND
INSPIRING CHANGE
1. Innovation
in Dance

The deeper the roots of a tree,
the higher the branches reach.
Similarly, the more knowledge
and depth you have of your dance traditions, the
more you can create and innovate.
If you look around, you will find movement and
rhythm everywhere. The flutter of birds, the quivering
of leaves, the sway of the grass, the sweeping of
the broom, the picking of tea leaves — they are all
movements. If you pick any such activity, you can
create your own movement based on it, with all the
material you have learnt.
Every dancer brings the potential for new
innovation in dance. A strong foundation in dance,
along with observations, experiences and your
original thoughts, bring uniqueness to your dance.

into dance by many artists. You have learnt about
Chhau, which has developed with martial arts
traditions of phari khanda.

Integration of Other Allied Forms

allied forms in dance, like martial arts.
There are some traditional sports and martial arts
traditions of India that have movement sequences in

Dance innovations with martial arts

19-06-2025 17:30:58

You will now learn about two other forms of martial
arts, which are being creatively used in present-day
development of dance.
1

Kalaripayattu­­: A practice of Kerala, it is considered
one of the oldest forms of martial arts worldwide.
Legend says that it originates from Parashurama,
the great sage, who is deemed to have been the
creator of Kerala. Recent researches connect it to
the Sangam Period, 600 – 300 BCE. Developed as
a self-defence mechanism, the training is based
on the scientific marma knowledge of Ayurveda
and has movement phrases which are based on
animal stances and movements.

2. Thang-Ta: A martial arts practice from Manipur,
the word means the ‘Art of Sword and Spear’. It
harmonises the inner energies with outer actions,
expressing various kinds of movements with
rhythmic breath control. It is also ritualistic in
practice. It is believed that all movements of the
Meitei people have originated from Thang-Ta.

Thang-Ta

Martial Arts used in Dance: The famous dancer
and choreographer Chandralekha was a pioneer
in amalgamating kalaripayattu and yoga with
bharatanatyam in her choreographies and
productions.

of the above martial arts with a visiting
practitioner or under the guidance and
inspection of a teacher from the QR code.

Many dance artists have experimented with their dance forms
to tell contemporary stories and showcase current scenarios.
You have learnt about two pioneers of the modern dance
development in India in Grade 7. In continuation, there are
many other dance practitioners and institutions that have been
instrumental in developing choreographies using creative
movements as well as using traditional dance vocabulary to
depict stories of today through dance.
The following are a few among many such artists who
have made significant contributions. Each of them has been
honoured with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for creative
choreography.

Note to the Teacher: Advisable to
do this in small groups.

ch13_DANCE.indd 146

Narendra Sharma expanded his horizons
and carved a niche for himself in developing
creative dance. One of the senior-most students
of Uday Shankar, his many choreographies
and dance dramas reflected socially relevant
contemporary situations. He is known to create
a healthy free dance movement for children,
in which his efforts have shown substantial success with the
institutionalisation of dance education. He produced over 40
original fabulous works, including notable productions like
Kamayani (1970), Wolf-Boy (1977), Antim Adhyaya (1985), and
Gandhi (2007). These works were acclaimed for their innovative
themes and choreographic excellence.

19-06-2025 17:30:59

Acharya Parvatikumar was a pioneering dance
choreographer for dance dramas like ‘Discovery
of India, Rhythm of Culture, and Dekh Teri Bambai’
where he seamlessly integrated various Indian dance
styles and showed contemporary concepts using
traditional dance forms, for example, creating a scene
of the Dabbawalas taking deliveries around the city using kathak
footwork, showing the chase between police and thief using the game of
‘hu-tu-tu’. On the traditional dance front, he was the only dance Guru
to have researched and choreographed the Marathi compositions
of Raja Sarfoji II of the Bhosale Dynasty in Bharatanatyam. He also
bridged the gap between theory and practice by choreographing the
dance text Abhinaya Darpanam into an audio-visual form.

Chandralekha was one of the earliest dancers who
dramatically brought changes in traditional forms
and synchronised various Indian dance, yoga and
kalaripayattu with philosophy, and literature also.
In her production Angika, she presented traditional
Bharatanatyam vocabulary of dance based on the
principles of Abhinaya Darpana and integrated Kalaripayattu with
it. Lilavati was based on Bhaskacharya’s mathematics treatise which
she choreographed in dance using numbers, nature and imagination.
Prana was based on yoga and breath in dance. She has also worked
with modern dancers and actors from the West in experimental
productions. She has made films on dance and written on the subject.
Among her films are The Myth of Woman (1976) and Hasta (1984).

Kumudini Lakhia,
the famous kathak
dancer, was one
of the pioneers
in bringing a
fresh outlook to
a form. She was
a pioneering kathak dancer and
choreographer who revolutionised
the traditional solo format of kathak
by introducing group choreography
and contemporary themes. Going
beyond the traditional repertoire, she
asked, “Where do I go from here?”.
Thus, her first groundbreaking
choreography, Atah Kim, was born.
Other creative dance productions
were Dhabkar (Pulse), The Coat,
Feathered Cloth
(Hagoromo)
among many
others. Her dance
choreographies
integrated the
abstract and
narratives, often
addressing
contemporary
themes.

2. Inclusivity in Dance
Inclusivity in dance is an essential aspect of today’s
society.
More and more dancers are creating work that is
accessible to all, including those who are differentlyabled. Dance teachers work with people of all ages
and abilities, bringing the joy of dance to all without
barriers and inhibitions. Even on national television
and important platforms, you see representation of
dance performances by the differently-abled.
Dance is also beyond gender. Dance traditions
predominantly performed by male artists have
also opened their doors to female artists. Most folk
traditions have men and women dancing alongside
each other. There is no gender bias.
The beauty of dance is in its ability to bring people
together. This is inclusivity.
What does inclusivity mean to you?

On 26 January 2025, India’s 76th Republic Day, the
Ministry of Culture set a Guinness World Record — by
bringing together over 5,000 folk and tribal artists
from across India to perform on the Kartavya Path in
New Delhi — for the largest ensemble of folk and tribal
artists at a single venue. This monumental event not
only set a world record but also symbolised inclusivity,
as artists from various cultural and tribal backgrounds
shared the stage, celebrating unity through diversity.

ACTIVITY 13.4: INSPIRING CHANGE
Dance empowers
During India’s freedom movement, song
and dance inspired everyone. From gender
discrimination to climate change, dance has
been used to convey complex topics and initiate
thought-provoking conversations effectively.
For instance, JNMDA, the premier institution
for Manipuri in Imphal, premiered their
choreography Keibul Lamjao in 1985 based on
the environmentalism of M. K. Binodini Devi’s
script, which shows the conservation of the
Sangai Deer.

Dance prompts you to think differently, to think
out of the box, and view the world with more
compassion and love.
What changes can you prompt with your dance?

A PRESENTATION OF DANCE
AND CHOREOGRAPHY
You are familiar with the Nāṭyaśhāstra and the Abhinaya Darpaṇam now.
In ancient times, when they were written, dance was usually called nr̥tta and
nr̥itya or nartana, whereas dance-drama was called nāṭya.
Have you ever wondered how dance originated?
If you refer to your Grade 6 Arts textbook (Theatre), you will recall an
interesting story about the birth of the performing arts. Similarly, you will
learn about the birth of dance from the Abhinaya Darpanam.

Brahma Deva, derived from all four Vedas, is said
to have created the Nāṭya Veda, often referred to
as called the fifth Veda.

ch14_DANCE.indd 152

Brahma Deva gave Nāṭya Veda to a Rishi, Bharata
Muni, who studied and mastered all three aspects
of nr̥tta, nr̥itya and nāṭya.

19-06-2025 16:37:34

Bharata Muni along with his group of Gandharvas (heavenly
musicians) and Apsarās (heavenly dancers) presented their
first performance.
At the time, the great dancer Mahadeva was also in the
audience.

He was so pleased to see the
performance that he offered Bharata
Muni special lessons with his best
ganas (attendants) in the rigorous
form of dancing called tandava.
Mahadeva’s gana, Tandu taught
tandava to the sages who taught it to
the humans.

Devi Parvati also taught lasya dance to Usha, the
daughter of King Bana. And Usha taught the dance to
the gopis (milkmaids) of Dwarka who then taught it to
the women of Saurashtra.
And so, more and more people learnt dance, and
that is how dance reached the earth.

On the other hand, Devi Parvati trained
Bharata Muni in the more graceful form of
dance called lasya.

ch14_DANCE.indd 154

Legends are a rich source for storytelling in the
Indian dance forms. Stories from the Puranas, Jataka
Tales, Panchatantra, etc., offer narratives that make
for beautiful visual spectacles and have a deep moral
message.
These stories are relevant even today when interpreted
according to the present times.

Ganga from heaven to Earth in Visual Arts.

values.
The story showcases:

What if you were to bring this story
into a dance production?

Think of a legend or historical tale that you can bring to the
contemporary world. Interpret it in present times and plan a
dance production to perform the story.

Phase 1: Planning and Pre-Production
Time for brainstorming ideas!



What is your production about?



Choose a myth, legend or historical story and give it a
twist to fit today’s world.



Will you write a script or use an existing one?



Will each dance tell part of the story?



How many dances will you include?

2. Style of Dance and Groups


What style or styles of dance would you include? Make
sure it fits the theme.



How many dance groups will you have, and how many
people per group?



Would you like to use any props?

A lot of this work in Phase 2 can happen
simultaneously. But remember, planning and
pre-production are crucial before venturing into any
creation. Similar to a construction site, you first take
the time to dig a deep foundation. If your foundation
is set, then it is easier to build a structure and you
can work on all the raw materials at different times
before assembling them together.

Phase 3: Performance

just like a whole show on the main stage that
you will perform. Invite a few people to give
feedback and make notes of anything that went
wrong (although by this point there should be
no mistakes).

NOTE TO THE TEACHERS
Dear Teacher,
As our students complete another stage of school
education this year, let us add more colours to
their academic journey with the learning of visual
arts. The chapters in this section would strengthen
their knowledge of visual fundamentals while also
developing their artistic skills and cultural awareness.
You can modify the activities to suit your local context
and the specific needs of your students.
To create the best learning experience for every
student, here are some points that need to be kept in
mind.

3. Motivate students to create original artwork
inspired by their observations of everyday life
and experiences, rather than copying images
from other sources.
4. Allow the students to explore, investigate,
experiment, collaborate and have dialogues in
the classroom.
5. Include outdoor activities and field trips to
observe the life, and culture around them.

The visual arts classroom would
require

6. Organise visits to museums, heritage monuments
and melas.

1. Adequate space for students to work comfortably.

7. Invite local artists and craftspersons for
interactive sessions, and workshops for hands-on
experience.

2. Sufficient light and ventilation.
3. Organised storage and easy access to art materials,
tools, basic stationery, and audio-visual facilities.
4. Space for showcasing and exhibiting artwork
periodically.

Visual arts pedagogy would need to
1. Use storytelling and everyday examples to
introduce concepts, and processes.

CH-15_VA.indd 163

2. Encourage students to freely express their
original ideas, imaginations, emotions and
curiosities in their artwork.

8. Inculcate simple habits of cleaning after working,
putting back materials that have been used and
maintaining materials with care.
9. Encourage the students’ participation and
decision-making in selecting artwork for
classroom display or exhibitions.

19-06-2025 16:35:53

Visual Arts assessment should be based on the
following competencies for the middle stage.
C-1.1 Expresses their personal and everyday life
experiences confidently through various visual art
forms.
C-1.2 Demonstrates flexibility in the process of
collaboratively developing visual arts practice.
C-2.1 Creates visual artwork based on situations or
stories that challenge stereotypes observed in their
surroundings (such as gender roles)
C-2.2 Connects visual imagery, symbols, and visual
metaphors with personal experiences, emotions and
imaginations

C-3.1 Demonstrates care and makes informed choices,
while using various materials, tools, and techniques
in visual arts.
C-3.2 Refines ideas and techniques of visual expression
from the stage of planning to the final presentation,
and reviewing the entire process.
C-4.1 Demonstrates familiarity with various local and
regional forms of art.
C-4.2 Describes the life and work of a few local artists
in their region and across India.
Activities marked by a star symbol
can be
facilitated by any teacher, even in schools with
limited resources.

ELEMENTS AND PRINCIPLES
OF VISUAL ART AND DESIGN
Elements of visual art and design are
similar to the ingredients of a recipe.
For example, halwā can be prepared
by cooking a combination of flour,
sugar, ghee and water.

Similarly, a visual can be made by
combining elements, such as point,
line, shape or form, colour, value,
texture and space.

A form is a threedimensional shape. It occupies
space and has depth. Forms can
also be created by arranging or
joining many two-dimensional
shapes.
Notice the form of the lion
in the image. what other forms
do you see?

1. Point is a dot. It is the smallest
element in any visual.
2. Line is the visible path that
joins any two points. Lines
can be horizontal, vertical,
diagonal,
dashed,
wavy,
zig-zagged and so on. They can
also vary in thickness.
3. Shape and form
A shape is a flat, twodimensional area enclosed by
a line. It can be geometric or
organic.
Lion Capital,
Mauryan period, circa 250 BCE

CH-15_VA.indd 165

4. Texture can be visual and
physical. It can be sensed by
touching a surface that feels
soft, rough, grainy, silky,
prickly and so on. It can also
be perceived visually through
patterns of lines and dots.

27-06-2025 17:36:53

166 | Kriti

5. Colour is visible when light is reflected and
perceived by our eyes. Colours are either
extracted from nature or manufactured
synthetically to make dyes and pigments.
Notice the colours in the image, can you
guess the natural materials used to create
them?

6. Value or Tone is the lightness or darkness
of a colour. Adding white to a colour makes
it lighter (tints), whereas adding black to a
colour makes it darker (shades). These create
colour gradations.
Observe the colour tonalities in the
painting.

7. Space is where various elements are organised
and composed to create an artwork. Space can
be divided into positive and negative space.
Identify the foreground and background in
the painting.

ACTIVITY 15.1: IDENTIFY THE VISUAL ELEMENTS
The elements of art and design allow us to express our ideas and
feelings visually. Look carefully, you will discover and recognise
the visual elements all around you.
Examine the artworks on this page and note down your
observations of the visual elements.

textiles and architectural details that you may find
in your surroundings. Identify and note down the
visual elements that you have observed, filling
your pages with it every day for a week.
Share these with your friends and discuss your
observations with your teacher.

SHADANGA
Shadanga refers
to the six limbs of
an art. This has
been codified in
the ancient Indian
text of Vishnudharmottara
Purana. This text
provides guidance
on how to combine
the visual elements
in an aesthetic or
tasteful way, while
making an artwork.
Just like how food
tastes good when
the ingredients are
combined in the
correct proportions
and cooked at the
right temperature.

PRINCIPLES OF VISUAL ART AND DESIGN
Well-composed visuals communicate ideas and emotions effectively
because they follow the principles of art and design. Read about each of
the principles and connect them with the painting on this page.
1. Unity and Harmony are created by
bringing elements together in a way
that is pleasing to the eye. Observe
the combination and distribution of
colours used in the painting.

Observe the plant stem next to
the mother and other lines on her
clothes.
4. Emphasis is created by making any
one of the visual element stand out.
Observe the coloured palm of the
mother’s hand, holding the flower.

2. Balance gives visual stability. For
example, if one half of an artwork
has a large image, it can be balanced
in the other half. Symmetrically,
either by a similar and large image
or asymmetrically, by many small
images. Observe the visual balance
in the Tribhanga posture of the
mother, and the position of the
child.

5. Proportion is the relationship
between the sizes of different visual
elements. It contributes to the
beauty, while also expressing the
ideas and emotions. Observe the
size of the baby in relation to the
mother in this painting.

3. Rhythm and Movement guide our
eyes from one part to another in an
appealing manner. They are created
through pattern and repetition.

Roy, Tempera on canvas

6. Hierarchy
is
the
order
of
importance in a visual. Observe that
the mother is given maximum space
in the painting. After that, focus on
the child, followed by other details
of the surroundings.

STILL LIFE IN
COLOUR

From cave paintings to temple
sculptures, objects were an
integral part of artworks, but
were never the main subject. In
Indian art, objects were depicted
to convey symbolic meanings and were an integral part
of the composition. For example, the Dharma Chakra
or wheel of law, weapons and musical instruments
were held by deities, courtiers, and so on.

Wheel as a Symbol (Wheel of Dharma)
in a Stone Carving, Sanchi Stupa

CH-16_VA.indd 177

Around the 16th century, a big change took place.
Objects became the main subject of artworks. Artists
got interested in arranging and studying a variety of
natural, and human-made objects which remained
still. The skill in painting it was in the manner that
not only make it appear three-dimensional but as if
life was added to them. This is why such artworks
came to be called still life.
Still life are not restricted only to drawing
and painting. Artists create still life compositions
as photographs and sculptures too. Today, still
life compositions are also used to create product
advertisements for magazines, hoardings, newspapers,
television, and so on.

ACTIVITY 16.1: ARRANGING A STILL LIFE
In a still life, it is very important to have
a visually interesting compositional
arrangement. This leads our eye to explore
every object as we perceive its contour,
form, colour, texture and relate it to the
other objects placed around it.
Make small groups according to your
shared interests before beginning this
activity.

Step 2: Choosing the backdrop
Select one or two large pieces of single-coloured cloth to
create a backdrop. The colour of the cloth should not distract
your attention from the objects, rather complements it. If
you do not have cloth, you can use any other material that
would create a plain backdrop so that the objects are in
focus.

A FEW OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS

Step 1: Choosing objects for a still life
1. Choose objects from your everyday life
and culture, which convey your identity
and belonging. You would enjoy making
it because you know its minutest details.
For example, a basket, clock, ball, toy,
shoes, trophies, flowers, fruits, etc.
2. Search for rare or unusual objects made
by local artists along with other objects
that complement it.
3. Select three to four objects that are of
varying materials, colours, textures,
sizes and dimensions.

CH-16_VA.indd 178

18-06-2025 16:07:07

Step 3: Arranging the objects
1. Drape the cloth with a few folds that fall
naturally.

In each of these artworks, identify the side from
which the light is falling.

2. Place objects so that it appear to overlap a
little when seen from different angles. The
objects should be composed as one unit.
3. Experiment with interesting placements
before finalising an arrangement. For
example, an object can be placed upright
or on its side, or leaning on something or
raised, etc.
4. Light and shadow: Objects should be placed
where light falls on it from one side, and
creates tonalities and shadows. For this,
you can partially close or open doors and
windows in your classroom, or use screens,
old banners, curtains or sheets to adjust, or
filter the light.
Note to the Teacher: Let students select objects and
experiment with different arrangements on the
first day.
They can put away the arrangement till the
next visual art period and rearrange the
still life as decided.

The tradition of making
hand-painted clay objects
is seen across India. Some
artists make fruits
and vegetables
in various
sizes, which

ACTIVITY 16.2: DRAW AND COLOUR THE STILL LIFE
MATERIALS
A4 size paper or 1/4
chart paper, pencils,
sharpeners, erasers,
colouring medium of
your choice

Note to the Teacher

CH-16_VA.indd 180

•

This activity will require
2 periods of 40 minutes each,
preferably as a block-period.

•

The still life arrangement should
not be disturbed while students
are working.

•

In case students use markers
or sketch pens, they can use
cross-hatching and stippling
techniques with
different colours
to achieve colour
tonalities, light
and shade.

•

In case students choose to prepare their own colours, ensure that the colours are ready to
use before beginning this activity.

•

Ask students to participate in organising the seating arrangement in the classroom. They
can sit around the still life arrangements in circular groups. By doing this, each student gets
to view the object from a different angle.

18-06-2025 16:07:10

Step 1: Observe the still life from your angle

Step 2: Five minutes observation

Look at the examples below, made by 5 different
students. Each student would have viewed this still
life from a different angle.
Find their differences and analyse by observing
these points —

Look at the still life you have arranged and decide
whether your drawing would fit better vertically, or
horizontally. Use the maximum space on your paper
for drawing.
Next, observe the following —

1. The areas occupied by the blue and green
backdrops.
2. The overlapping portions and spaces between
the objects.
3. The shadows and highlights on the objects.
4. The mouths of both containers.

 The size of each object and its proportion to the
others.
 The lines and contours of every object.
 Various shapes that are combined to make
each object.

181 | STILL LIFE IN COLOUR

CH-16_VA.indd 181

18-06-2025 16:07:11

182 | Kriti

 Symmetries and asymmetries.
 Overlapping parts of the object (the portions that
are not seen from your angle).
 Distance between objects and the shapes of its
negative spaces.
 Angle of light and the shadows (falling on the
objects, cloth and surfaces).
Step 3: Draw the contour using light lines
 Mark the points of various objects that would be
close to the edges of your paper. This will ensure
that all your objects stay within the frame.
 Mark the ratio and proportion of objects. Use your
pencil to measure the proportion of the smallest
object in relation to the tallest object.
Important: Note the ratios for achieving correct
proportions and not drawing the actual size of the
objects.
 Draw the hidden basic shapes of each object and fit
it within the markings you have made.
 Complete the contour and add details using light
lines.

CH-16_VA.indd 182

Technical Tip
Keep lifting your head up every few seconds
to observe the still life. This will improve your
observation and help you achieve a close
resemblance to the objects in your drawing.

18-06-2025 16:07:12

Step 4: Colour the still life
Use a medium of your choice, and
try different techniques to show
tones and shades of colours. Be
innovative while mixing colours and
experiments with varying sizes, and
colours of dots, lines, strokes and
patches.

ARTISTS WHO ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR STILL LIFE
Art has no boundaries and artists take inspiration from
their own culture as well as from other cultures.
Here are two examples of still life paintings. Observe,
and note down the similarities and differences in the
still life arrangements, colours, brush strokes, and so on.
Paul Cezanne was a French artist of the 19th century.
He was known for experimenting with new techniques
of painting, which were not easily accepted by many
during his time.

Krishna Howlaji Ara, Still life, mid 20th century

Krishna Howlaji Ara was a well-known Indian
artist from the 20th century. He was a member
of the Progressive Artists Group in Mumbai, who
were inspired by artists from all over the world.
K. H. Ara was known for his still life painting.
Note to the Teacher: Introduce students to a
variety of still life artworks and artists.

PEOPLE IN PLACES

INTRODUCTION TO PERSPECTIVE
Paintings and drawings have the power to
transport you to other worlds. Some appear
two-dimensional and entice you with the beauty
of lines, patterns, colours and textures. Some
others appear three-dimensional as though they are popping out of the
surface. Have you wondered how this happens?
Perspective is the technique of showing three-dimensional space on a
two-dimensional surface. It creates an illusion of distance and depth,
where things that are closer, appear bigger and have more details than
those that are further away. You can create this magic with practice, by
keenly observing the views in front of you.

Look at the pictures below.
Although the lines on either
side of the road are parallel,
they appear to converge in the
distance. You would see the
same on railway tracks too.
Observe


The horizon line aligns
with the eye level of the
viewer.



The lines converge at a
vanishing point, which is
also at the eye level.

In order to visualise how the lines
appear when seen in perspective —


Visualise your eyeball as a circle with
its centre as the vanishing point.



Imagine the horizontal line across
the centre of eye as the horizon line.



Imagine other lines radiating from
the centre in different directions.

To draw in perspective, three things
are important —
1. Identifying the horizon line at eye
level in the scene.
2. Visualising the vanishing point.

3. Observing the angle of lines that
converge at the vanishing point.

Perspective can help you observe,
and draw buildings and architectural
monuments in a way that looks realistic.
Take the example of the image printed on
the 100 rupee note.
Notice how the lines of the upper and
lower storeys of the stepwell appear to
converge at the vanishing point.

HUMAN ANATOMY
The structure of the human body is called anatomy.
Look at your old photographs and notice how your
body structure has changed from the time you were
a baby till the present. Over the years, some parts of
your body grow more than the others.
The relationship between the different parts of
the body is measured, and expressed in ratio and
proportions. For example, if the head is one part,
we can find out which parts of the body are of the
same size (1:1), which parts are twice the size of the
head (1:2) and which parts are thrice the size of the
head (1:3).

CH-17_VA.indd 191

27-06-2025 11:22:07

192 | Kriti

The system of measuring the ratio and proportions
of the human body has been a central part of Indian
painting, and the sculpture traditions. Texts from
the Shilpa Shastra mention different ratios and
proportions for depicting divine beings, people of
royalty, warriors, children, animals and various
other mythological beings. The system is known as
the Tālamāna Paddhati, where the unit of one tāla is
equal to the length of an adult hand measured from
the bottom of the wrist to the tip of the middle finger.

Note to the Teacher: Help students connect and
apply their mathematical skills while explaining
ratio and proportions of the human body.

ACTIVITY 17.2: MARK THE PROPORTIONS
Mark the proportions for all the people in the
picture as shown in the example.
 Mark the size of the head using two horizontal
lines.
 Measure the distance between the two lines
and use the same to mark more horizontal lines
along the length of the body.
 Count the number of times the head repeated
in each human figure.
 Write the ratio of the height in relation to the
head.
Discuss the differences you have discovered
in the body proportions of different age-groups
and body types.

Note to the Teacher: Discuss this activity with the
Mathematics teacher and ask students to take their
help to understand and write the ratios and
proportions.

ACTIVITY 17.3: DRAW YOUR FRIENDS
There are small variations in the body proportions
of every person, which makes them look different
from others. There are no stereotypical proportions
that everyone can fit into.
Observe the body proportions of your own
friends and peers, and make drawings from it. Take
turns to pose in standing positions so that you can
observe and draw the whole body.
Step 1: Start with the head and note the
proportions. You have learnt to use your pencil as
a measuring tool while drawing still life objects. In
the same way, use your pencil to measure the size
of the head and note the number of times it repeats
in the body.

BODY POSITIONS AND POSTURES
After you make one or two drawings of the standing
figure, observe the body proportions in different
postures and positions, such as sitting, bending,
lying, squatting, and other positions. Request your
friends or family members to pose for you as you
draw them.
Show them your drawings and tell them the
fascinating things you have learnt about the
proportions of human body.

Step 2: Based on the proportions that you have
measured, make rough markings so that your
drawing of the entire body fits comfortably on your
paper.
Step 3: Continue to measure and verify the
proportions as you draw each part. Focus on
capturing the proportions that you see.
Step 4: Complete your drawing and share it with
your friends. Take feedback from your teacher on
the parts of your drawing that look proportionate
and where you can improve.

ACTIVITY 17.4: COMPOSITION IN PERSPECTIVE
Now that you have learnt about perspective
and human proportions, it’s time to create
your own compositions that show people in
indoor or outdoor settings.

Step 1: Make a few preparatory sketches for the layout
of your composition
 Use your earlier drawings to plan the foreground,
middleground and background elements.
 Mark the horizon line and it vanishing point.
 To begin, use three human figures shown in varying
distances — one can be near and another in a distance.
 Using your knowledge of proportion and perspective,
draw the other elements, such as furniture, objects,
trees, roads, vehicles, buildings, etc.
Note: The human figures should be proportionate to the
landscape or indoor setting they are placed in.
Step 2: Choose one layout
Show your preparatory sketches to your teacher, take their
suggestions and discuss your choice for your final artwork.
Step 3: Begin the final artwork

Step 4: Colouring process
 Choose any medium to colour
your artwork (colour pencils,
pastels, crayons, watercolours,
poster colours, acrylic colours,
natural colours, etc.).
 Choose your colour theme
based on seasons, time of the
day, mood and so on.
 Try different combinations on
your preparatory sketches.
 Now, you are ready to execute
your final artwork.
Step 5: Title your artwork
 Jot down a few thoughts about
your artwork (your ideas,
inspirations, memories and
personal connections).
 Based on these thoughts, write
a short phrase that could be
the title of your artwork.

ARTS OF THE PEOPLE, WITH THE
PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE

Art has been a part of human life
since prehistoric times. Every
artefact carries the voice and
touch of other humans, forging a
connection between them and us
across the time. Just as innovations in materials, tools
and technology influence arts processes; changes in
social values, ideas and behaviour influence creative
thoughts and expressions. It is fascinating to learn about
the lives and work of artists. They take us into their
world of imagination, trigger many different emotions
that make us reflect on our lives and actions.
Art is a part of our everyday life. From the clothes
we wear to the plate we eat from, all is a piece of art.
In this chapter, you will be introduced to a variety of
art practices that primarily use everyday materials like
thread, paper and cloth to create beautiful objects, and
artwork. You will learn how these materials are crafted
using specific techniques, and in the process, you will
be able to appreciate the hard work, patience and
dedication of hundreds of artists, who have kept these
traditions alive.

ACTIVITY 18.1: TIE AND LINK
Nature has fascinating networks that connect all living beings to
one another.
Even though you don’t usually see the roots of plants and trees,
you know that they sustain life. Some trees like the banyan have
roots that grow out of their branches above the ground.
In Meghalaya, the Indian rubber tree has very strong secondary
roots that grow above the ground. The people of the region have
trained these living roots to form long bridges across streams and
rivers.
It takes a lot of time for
these bridges to form. They
are gently twisted onto one
another and tied in different
places for support. The
bridges get stronger over
time as the roots grow.
Twisting,
knotting,
crocheting,
knitting
and
weaving are some techniques
used by artists in different
Living Root Bridges of Meghalaya

parts of our country. Baskets, handloom
fabric, fans and even charpoy are
created using these techniques. These
are everyday objects created for daily
use by the people, for the people.
Find ropes made of cotton, jute or
any other natural fibre that is easily
available in your region and create a
small artwork yourself.

Note to the Teacher: Highlight the connection that human
societies have with nature and the importance of sustainable
choices across art practices.

ACTIVITY 18.2: PATCH AND MATCH
Have you ever wondered what happens to the clothes you
don’t use anymore?
Fabrics have a long life. Patchwork is a technique used in many
parts of the world, where small pieces of fabric are joined and
sewn together to create a large piece of fabric. They are made into
blankets, cradles, bags, cushion covers, table mats, dhurries,
and so on. In many parts of India, women bring fragments
of old fabric that each of them collect and quilt it together.

CH-18_VA.indd 202

These patchwork
quilts are like the
symbols of shared
memories.
Imagine our
society as a
patchwork
quilt. Each
individual
plays an
equally
important
role in
creating
the overall
picture.
Anything one
person does or
creates has the
power to change
the picture of
their entire
society.

Patchwork

18-06-2025 16:08:07

LEARN TO SEW PATCHES
Work in small groups for this activity.
Step 1: Collect old fabric from your homes that are
not in use anymore. Go around and check in your
school as well.
Step 2: Find a large piece that is minimum 30 cm ×
30 cm to use as your base.
Step 3: Gather the other pieces you have collected and
cut them into squares or rectangles of approximately
5 – 6 cm.
Step 4: Spread your base fabric and place the smaller
pieces over it in a pattern you find visually interesting.
Step 5: Join and sew the individual pieces together
along their edges on the reverse side. This will
ensure that the stitches are not seen when you flip
them over.
Step 6: After joining all the small pieces, place the
patchwork on the base cloth and sew it using many
lines of running stitches over the patches. You can
create interesting patterns and use coloured threads
for the lines of running stitches.
Step 7: Complete your quilt by closing up the edges
with another piece of cloth or by folding and stitching.

Note on safety: Take precautions while using sharp
objects like the scissors and needles. Use a sponge or
a dedicated piece of thick cloth to store your needles
so that they do not get misplaced and cause harm to
others.

Some quilting artists create
elaborate pictures and visual
stories using this technique.

ACTIVITY 18.3: PULP AND PAINT
Thousands of newspapers are printed daily. They are
discarded after reading and are sometimes reused as
packaging material, or made into bags, and so on.
What do you do with old newspapers?
When certain kinds of soft paper like newspaper and
tissue are mixed with water and glue, they become very
strong.
Papier-mâché is a technique
through which this mixture of
paper, water and glue are molded
into a three-dimensional form.
These forms are inspired by
the artist’s environment and their
culture. They are then painted using
pigments available in the region.
Even though artists use the same
Kashmiri Papier-mâché box
base of papier-mâché, the motifs
with the Chinar tree motif
and patterns vary from region to
region.
Everyday material like paper can be transformed
into beautiful artworks. Papier-mâché is widely practised
in many parts of our country. How do you think these
practices have travelled from one part of the country
to another?

CH-18_VA.indd 204

Note to the Teacher: The process of making paper
pulp involves careful observation of the
material consistency at every stage. Connect
this activity with science concepts, and skills
to analyse changes in the property of
paper caused by water and glue.

18-06-2025 16:08:09

LEARN TO MAKE PAPIER-MÂCHÉ
Work in small groups for this activity. Follow this
process to create a small form using papier-mâché.
Step 1: Cut old newspapers into small pieces or thin
strips and soak them in water for a few days in a large
tub or container.
Step 2: Take out the soaked paper and squeeze out
the excess water from it.
Step 3: Crush, mash or grind the paper into a pulp.
You can also use a mortar and pestle to grind it by
hand.
Step 4: Add a little glue to the paper pulp and mix it
well.

Step 5: Take a small bowl or any other shallow object
as your mould and coat its outer surface with any
greasy substance like petroleum jelly or a thick oil.
Step 6: Turn the object upside down. Take thin strips
of damp newspaper and overlap them over the object
evenly till the entire surface is covered. Apply the
pulp thickly and evenly over the entire object. Allow
it to dry completely for a few days.
Step 7: When dry, turn the object over and gently
release the mould.
Step 8: Neaten up your papier-mâché artwork
by using a fine sandpaper, and add colour and
decorations to it.

CAMPAIGN FOR
ART AWARENESS

An awareness campaign helps
communicate
a
particular
message and brings focus to
important issues. This message
could be about a new service, or
discount on a product, it could
be a public announcement like the campaign about
wearing masks during the pandemic or a message
about voter registration. The arts are often used in
awareness campaigns related to health, hygiene,
environment, justice, and so on.
Posters, fliers, banners, hoardings, handouts and
brochures are designed to help communicate these
messages. Each of these are carefully crafted with
words and visuals to grab people’s attention, and bring
their focus to your message. You might have seen or
created posters, banners, fliers and handouts for a
variety of causes, and programmes in school.
Do you think it is important to create awareness
about the arts? In this chapter, you will create an
awareness campaign to inspire others to participate,
support and appreciate a variety of art forms, and
cultural artefacts.

CH-19_VA.indd 207

Creating a campaign involves many steps like
collecting material, researching, choosing a format,
writing your main message and making visuals. You
will undertake all of these steps to create awareness
about arts.

ACTIVITY 19.1: CHOOSE THE SUBJECT FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN
For your campaign, begin by choosing a subject.
You can work with an artist who may be a painter,
sculptor, designer or photographer. You can also
choose a community that is keeping an art and craft
tradition alive, like you studied in the previous
chapter or a school production, or even a project
of your own.
Make small groups of 4 to 5 students each and
think about a subject for your campaign together.
Here are some prompts —


Do you know any artists and art practices from
your region?



Is there an upcoming festival, local crafts fair
in your locality where you are likely to meet
artists?



Are there any art and design schools in your
region?



Is there an art museum or gallery near you?
What kind of artworks do they exhibit?

There are so many artists and art practices that
you may not know about. Choose the one you can
relate to and discuss it with your teacher.

CH-19_VA.indd 208

19-06-2025 17:13:47

ACTIVITY 19.2: COLLECT INFORMATION
Collect information about your chosen topic by
doing these —


Talk to teachers, friends and family members.



Visit the library, refer to the local newspapers
and your textbooks from previous years.



Visit artists and their studios, or workplaces.



Visit a gallery, museum, art fair or haats.



Use the internet under adult supervision to get
more information.

Maintain notes of the information you have find.
Collect visual and text pieces. Try and look for the
following pieces of information —


What contribution does this artist or artwork have
on the society?



What is the story behind the artist and artwork?



What do you find the most special about this artist,
artwork or art practice?



What is the inspiration behind the artwork?



Are there any specific materials or techniques used?



What are the social, economic or environmental
challenges did they face?

Note to the Teacher: It is important for students
to present the information as interesting stories
with visuals rather than dates and chronology
from their biography. Support and guide students
in finding, visuals and relate it to the
information they gather about the artists.

ACTIVITY 19.3: ORGANISE THE INFORMATION


Think of the main message you want to
communicate with your campaign.



Go through the information that you have
collected.



Create a catchy title for your campaign. The
title should not be more than 5 to 7 words and
reflect your message clearly.



Organise the information under different
headings like —



If you are creating a campaign for your own
dance and theatre performance, then your
title, and main message should inspire people
to come, and see your production.
