FOREWORD

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on
the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They
also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures
will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system
of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).

The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own
learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must
recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new
knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.
Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one
of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat
children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of
knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode
of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as
rigour in implementing the annual calender so that the required number
of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for
teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook
proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather
than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to
address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and
reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for
child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space
to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee

responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the
advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and
the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor B. L. Khandelwal for guiding
the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the
development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for
making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and
organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their
resources, material and personnel. As an organisation committed to systemic
reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT
welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further
revision and refinement.

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOKS

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content
load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises
reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential
learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has
undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes.
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes
have been taken into consideration in this exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:

• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in
the same class

• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same
subject

• Difficulty level

• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through
self-learning or peer-learning

• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the
changes given above.

PREFACE

Chemistry has made a profound impact on the society. It is intimately linked
to the well-being of human kind. The rate of advancements in chemistry is so
high that curriculum developers continuously look for strategies to cope with
these advancements. Also, the students have to be inspired to be the future
leaders who would make fundamental contributions. The present textbook is
a sincere effort in this direction.

The structure of the textbook, presented in two parts, comprises of sixteen
Units. Although the titles of various Units indicate a sort of
compartmentalisation into physical, inorganic and organic chemistry, readers
will find that these sub-disciplines have been intermingled, at least to a certain
extent, to have a unified approach to the subject.  The approach of presentation
of the subject matter discourages students from rote memorisation. The subject
has in fact, been organised around the laws and principles of chemistry. As
students master these laws and principles, they will soon get to the point
where they can predict much of what will come.

Efforts have been directed towards making the subject stimulating and
exciting by references to the historical developments and its usefulness to our
lives, wherever appropriate. The text is well illustrated with examples from
surrounding environment to facilitate grasping of the qualitative and
quantitative aspects of the concept easily. Physical data are given in SI units
throughout the book to make comparison of various properties easier. IUPAC
system of nomenclature has been followed along with the common system.
Structural formulae of chemical compounds showing functional/coordinating
groups in different colours are drawn using electronic system. Each Unit has
a good number of examples, as illustrations, with their solutions and some
intext questions, the answers of some of which are given at the end of the Unit.
The end of Unit exercises are designed to apply important principles and
provoke thinking process to solve them.  Answers of some of these exercises
are given at the end of the book.

A variety of materials, e.g., biographical sketches of some scientists,
additional information related to a particular topic, etc., is given in boxes with
a deep yellow coloured bar. This boxed material with a 'deep yellow bar' is to
bring additional life to the topic. However, it is  non-evaluative. The structures
of some of the more complex compounds incorporated in the book are for
understanding their chemistry. As their reproduction would lead to
memorisation, it is also a non-evaluative portion of the text.

The information part has been significantly reduced and, wherever possible,
it has been substantiated with facts.  However, it is necessary for students to

vii

be aware of commercially important chemicals, their process of manufacture
and sources of raw materials.  This leads to descriptive material in the book.
Attempts have been made to make descriptions of such compounds interesting
by considering their structures and reactivity.  Thermodynamics, kinetics and
electrochemical aspects have been applied to chemical reactions which should
be beneficial to students for understanding why a particular reaction happened
and why a particular property is exhibited by the product. There is currently
great awareness of environmental and energy issues which are directly related
to chemistry.  Such issues have been highlighted and dealt with at appropriate
places in the book.

A team of experts constituted by the NCERT has developed the manuscript
of the book.  It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the valuable contribution
of all the members of this team. I also acknowledge the valuable and relentless
contribution of the editors in bringing the book to the present shape. I also
acknowledge with thanks the dedicated efforts and valuable contribution of
Professor Brahm Parkash, who not only coordinated the entire programme
but also actively involved in writing and editing of this book. Thanks are also
due to the participating teachers and subject experts of the review workshop
for their contribution, which has helped us to make the book learner friendly.
Also, I thank the technical and administrative staff of the NCERT for their
support in the entire process.

The team of this textbook development programme hopes that the book
stimulates its readers and makes them feel the excitement and fascination for
this subject.  Efforts have been made to bring out this book error-free.
Nevertheless, it is recognised that in such a book of complexity, there could
inevitably be occasional errors.  It will always be a pleasure to hear about
them from readers to take necessary steps to rectify them.

In addition to +3, oxidation states +2 and +4 are also exhibited by some of the lanthanoids.

4.13 In transition elements the oxidation states vary from +1 to any highest oxidation state by one

For example, for manganese it may vary as +2, +3, +4, +5, +6, +7. In the nontransition elements the
variation is selective, always differing by 2, e.g. +2, +4, or +3, +5 or +4, +6 etc.

APPENDIX IV

Logarithms

Sometimes, a numerical expression may involve multiplication, division or rational powers of large
numbers. For such calculations, logarithms are very useful. They help us in making difficult calculations
easy. In Chemistry, logarithm values are required in solving problems of chemical kinetics, thermodynamics,
electrochemistry, etc. We shall first introduce this concept, and discuss the laws, which will have to be
followed in working with logarithms, and then apply this technique to a number of problems to show
how it makes difficult calculations simple.

We know that

23 = 8, 32 = 9, 53 = 125, 70 = 1

In general, for a positive real number a, and a rational number m, let am = b,

where b is a real number. In other words

the mth power of base a is b.

Another way of stating the same fact is

logarithm of b to base a is m.

If for a positive real number a, a ¹ 1
am = b,

we say that m is the logarithm of b to the base a.

b
We write this as log a  m ,

“log” being the abbreviation of the word “logarithm”.
Thus, we have

3
log2 8 = 3, Since2 = 8

2
log3 9 = 2, Since3 = 9

3
log5 125 = 3, Since5 = 125

0
log7 1 = 0, Since7 = 1

Laws of Logarithms

In the following discussion, we shall take logarithms to any base a, (a > 0 and a ¹ 1)

First Law: log  
a (mn) = logam + logan

Proof: Suppose that logam = x and logan = y
Then ax= m, ay = n
Hence mn = ax.ay = ax+y

It now follows from the definition of logarithms that
loga (mn) = x + y = loga m – loga n

 m 
Second Law: log  

a   = log m – log
 n  a an

Proof: Let logam = x, logan = y

145 Appendix

Reprint 2025-26



Then ax = m, ay = n

x
m a xy

Hence   a
y

n a

Therefore

 m 
loga    x  y  loga m  loga n

 n 
Third Law : loga(m

n) = n logam
Proof : As before, if logam = x, then ax = m

n
Then   x n nx

m  a  a

giving loga(m
n) = nx = n loga m

Thus according to First Law: “the log of the product of two numbers  is equal to the sum of their logs.
Similarly, the Second Law says: the log of the ratio of two numbers is the difference of their logs. Thus,
the use of these laws converts a problem of multiplication/division into a problem of addition/subtraction,
which are far easier to perform than multiplication/division. That is why logarithms are so useful in
all numerical computations.
Logarithms to Base 10
Because number 10 is the base of writing numbers, it is very convenient to use logarithms to the base
10. Some examples are:
log  

10 10 = 1, since 101 = 10
log10 100 = 2, since 102 = 100
log10 10000 = 4, since 104 = 10000
log10 0.01 = –2, since 10–2 = 0.01
log10 0.001 = –3, since 10–3

  =  0.001
and log101 = 0 since 100 = 1

The above results indicate that if n is an integral power of 10, i.e., 1 followed by several zeros or
1 preceded by several zeros immediately to the right of the decimal point, then log n can be easily found.

If n is not an integral power of 10, then it is not easy to calculate log n. But mathematicians have
made tables from which we can read off approximate value of the logarithm of any positive number
between 1 and 10. And these are sufficient for us to calculate the logarithm of any number expressed
in decimal form. For this purpose, we always express the given decimal as the product of an integral
power of 10 and a number between 1 and 10.

Standard Form of Decimal
We can express any number in decimal form, as the product of (i) an integral power of 10, and (ii)

a number between 1 and 10. Here are some examples:
(i) 25.2 lies between 10 and 100

25.2 1
25.2 =  10  2.52  10

10

(ii) 1038.4 lies between 1000 and 10000.

1 0 3 8 .4 3 3
 1 0 3 8 .4   1 0  1 .0 3 8 4  1 0

1 0 0 0

(iii) 0.005 lies between 0.001 and 0.01

∴ –3 –3
 0.005 = (0.005 × 1000) × 10  = 5.0 × 10

(iv) 0.00025 lies between 0.0001 and 0.001

∴ –4 –4
 0.00025 = (0.00025 × 10000) × 10  = 2.5 × 10

Reprint 2025-26



In each case, we divide or multiply the decimal by a power of 10, to bring one non-zero digit to the left
of the decimal point, and do the reverse operation by the same power of 10, indicated separately.

Thus, any positive decimal can be written in the form
p

n = m × 10
where p is an integer (positive, zero or negative) and 1< m < 10. This is called the “standard form of n.”

Working Rule
1. Move the decimal point to the left, or to the right, as may be necessary, to bring one non-zero digit

to the left of decimal point.
p

2. (i) If you move p places to the left, multiply by 10 .
–p

(ii) If you move p places to the right, multiply by 10 .
0

(iii) If you do not move the decimal point at all, multiply by 10 .
(iv) Write the new decimal obtained by the power of 10 (of step 2) to obtain the standard form of

the given decimal.

Characteristic and Mantissa
Consider the standard form of n

p
n = m ×10 , where 1 < m < 10
Taking logarithms to the base 10 and using the laws of logarithms

p
log n = log m + log 10

= log m + p log 10
= p + log m

Here p is an integer and as 1 < m < 10, so 0 < log m < 1, i.e., m lies between 0 and 1. When log
n has been expressed as p + log m, where p is an integer and 0 log m < 1, we say that p is the
“characteristic” of log n and that log m is the “mantissa of log n. Note that characteristic is always an
integer – positive, negative or zero, and mantissa is never negative and is always less than 1. If we can
find the characteristics and the mantissa of log n, we have to just add them to get log n.

Thus to find log n, all we have to do is as follows:
1. Put n in the standard form, say

p
n = m × 10 , 1 <  m <10

2. Read off the characteristic p of log n from this expression (exponent of 10).
3. Look up log m from tables, which is being explained below.
4. Write log n = p + log m

If the characteristic p of a number n is say, 2 and the mantissa is .4133, then we have log n = 2
+ .4133 which we can write as 2.4133. If, however, the characteristic p of a number m is say –2 and the
mantissa is .4123, then we have log m = –2 + .4123. We cannot write this as –2.4123. (Why?) In order

to avoid this confusion we write 2  for  –2 and thus we write log m = 2.4123 .

Now let us explain how to use the table of logarithms to find mantissas. A table is appended at the
end of this Appendix.

Observe that in the table, every row starts with a two digit number, 10, 11, 12,... 97, 98, 99. Every
column is headed by a one-digit number, 0, 1, 2, ...9. On the right, we have the section called “Mean
differences” which has 9 columns headed by 1, 2...9.

Now suppose we wish to find log (6.234). Then look into the row starting with 62. In this row, look
at the number in the column headed by 3. The number is 7945. This means that

log (6.230) = 0.7945*
But we want log (6.234). So our answer will be a little more than 0.7945. How much more? We look

this up in the section on Mean differences. Since our fourth digit is 4, look under the column headed
by 4 in the Mean difference section (in the row 62). We see the number 3 there. So add 3 to 7945. We
get 7948. So we finally have

log (6.234) = 0.7948.
Take another example. To find log (8.127), we look in the row 81 under column 2, and we find 9096.

We continue in the same row and see that the mean difference under 7 is 4. Adding this to 9096, and
we get 9100. So, log (8.127) = 0.9100.

Finding N when log N is given
We have so far discussed the procedure for finding log n when a positive number n given. We now turn
to its converse i.e., to find n when log n is given and give a method for this purpose. If log n = t, we
sometimes say n = antilog t. Therefore our task is given t, find its antilog. For this, we use the ready-
made antilog tables.

Suppose log n = 2.5372.
To find n, first take just the mantissa of log n. In this case it is .5372. (Make sure it is positive.)

Now take up antilog of this number in the antilog table which is to be used exactly like the log table.
In the antilog table, the entry under column 7 in the row .53 is 3443 and the mean difference for the
last digit 2 in that row is 2, so the table gives 3445. Hence,

antilog (.5372) = 3.445
Now since log n = 2.5372, the characteristic of log n is 2. So the standard form of n is given by

2
 n = 3.445 × 10

or n = 344.5

Illustration 1:
If log x = 1.0712, find x.

Solution: We find that the number corresponding to 0712 is 1179. Since characteristic of log x is 1, we
have

x = 1.179 × 10

= 11.79
Illustration 2:

If log10 x = 2.1352,  find x.

Solution: From antilog tables, we find that the number corresponding to 1352 is 1366. Since the

characteristic is 2  i.e., –2, so
–2

x = 1.366 × 10  = 0.01366

Use of Logarithms in Numerical Calculations
Illustration 1:

Find 6.3 × 1.29
Solution: Let x = 6.3 × 1.29

Then log10 x = log (6.3 × 1.29) = log 6.3 + log 1.29
Now,
log 6.3 = 0.7993
log 1.29 = 0.1106
\ log10 x = 0.9099,

* It should, however, be noted that the values given in the table are not exact. They are only approximate values,
although we use the sign of equality which may give the impression that they are exact values. The same
convention will be followed in respect of antilogarithm of a number.

concentrations and so on.

In this Unit, we will consider mostly liquid
solutions and their formation. This will be followed by
studying the properties of the solutions, like vapour
pressure and colligative properties. We will begin with
types of solutions and then various alternatives in
which concentrations of a solute can be expressed in
liquid solution.

1 . 1 Types of Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two

Solutions components. By homogenous mixture we mean that its composition
and properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the
component that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent.
Solvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or
more components present in the  solution other than solvent are called
solutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions (i.e.,

consisting of two components). Here each component may be
solid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1.1.

Composition of a solution can be described by expressing its
1 .2 Expressing concentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively

Concentration or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the

of Solutions solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute)
or it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of
solute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to
lot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description
of the solution.

There are several ways by which we can describe the concentration
of the solution quantitatively.

(i) Mass percentage (w/w): The mass percentage of a component of a
solution is defined as:
Mass % of a component

Mass of the component in the solution 
= 100 (1.1)

Total mass of the solution

For example, if a solution is described by 10% glucose in water by
mass, it means that 10 g of glucose is dissolved in 90 g of water
resulting in a 100 g solution. Concentration described by mass
percentage is commonly used in industrial chemical applications.
For example, commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62 mass
percentage of sodium hypochlorite in water.

(ii) Volume percentage (V/V): The volume percentage is defined as:

Volume of  the component
Volume % of a component = 100

Total volume of  solution
(1.2)

For example, 10% ethanol solution in water means that 10 mL
of ethanol is dissolved in water such that the total volume of
the solution is 100 mL. Solutions containing liquids are commonly
expressed in this unit. For example, a 35% (v/v) solution of
ethylene glycol, an antifreeze, is used in cars for cooling the
engine. At this concentration the antifreeze lowers the freezing
point of water to 255.4K (–17.6°C).

(iii) Mass by volume percentage (w/V): Another unit which is
commonly used in medicine and pharmacy is mass by
volume percentage. It is the mass of solute dissolved in
100 mL of the solution.

(iv) Parts per million: When a solute is present in trace quantities, it
is convenient to express concentration in parts per million (ppm)
and is defined as:
Parts per million =

Number of  parts of  the component
 ×106

(1.3)
Total number of parts of  all components of the solution

As in the case of percentage, concentration in parts per million can
also be expressed as mass to mass, volume to volume and mass to
volume. A litre of sea water (which weighs 1030 g) contains about

–3
6 × 10  g of dissolved oxygen (O2). Such a small concentration is

6
also expressed as 5.8 g per 10  g (5.8 ppm) of sea water. The
concentration of pollutants in water or atmosphere is often expressed

–1
in terms of mg mL  or ppm.

(v) Mole fraction: Commonly used symbol for mole fraction is x and
subscript used on the right hand side of x denotes the component.
It is defined as:
Mole fraction of a component =

Number of  moles of  the component
(1.4)

Total number of  moles of  all the components

For example, in a binary mixture, if the number of moles of A and B are
nA and nB respectively, the mole fraction of A will be

n
x A

A = (1.5)
n A   nB

For a solution containing i number of components, we have:

n  n
xi = i   = i (1.6)

 n1   n 2  .......  n i  n i

It can be shown that in a given solution sum of all the mole
fractions is unity, i.e.

x1 + x2 + .................. + xi = 1 (1.7)

Mole fraction unit is very useful in relating some physical properties
of solutions, say vapour pressure with the concentration of the
solution and quite useful in describing the calculations involving
gas mixtures.

in one litre (or one cubic decimetre) of solution,

Moles of solute
Molarity  (1.8)

Volume of solution in litre

For example, 0.25 mol L–1 (or 0.25 M) solution of NaOH means that

per kilogram (kg) of the solvent and is expressed as:

Moles of solute
Molality (m) = (1.9)

Mass of solvent in kg

For example, 1.00 mol kg  (or 1.00 m) solution of KCl means that
1 mol (74.5 g) of KCl is dissolved in 1 kg of water.
Each method of expressing concentration of the solutions has its
own merits and demerits. Mass %, ppm, mole fraction and molality
are independent of temperature, whereas molarity is a function of
temperature. This is because volume depends on temperature
and the mass does not.

1.3 Solubility Solubility of a substance is its maximum amount that can be dissolved
in a specified amount of solvent at a specified temperature. It depends
upon the nature of solute and solvent as well as temperature and
pressure. Let us consider the effect of these factors in solution of a solid
or a gas in a liquid.

1.3.1 Solubility of Every solid does not dissolve in a given liquid. While sodium chloride
a Solid in a and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do
Liquid not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in

benzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that
polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in non-
polar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the
intermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like
dissolves like.

When a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves
and its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as
dissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute
particles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as
crystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the
same rate. Under such conditions, number of solute particles going
into solution  will be equal to the solute particles separating out and
a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached.

Solute + Solvent ⇌  Solution (1.10)

At this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain
constant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure.
Similar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents.
Such a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same
temperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An
unsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at
the same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium
with undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the
maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent.
Thus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility.

Earlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into
another depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these
variables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also
control this phenomenon.

Effect of temperature

The solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature
changes. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1.10. This,
being dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle. In
general, if in a nearly saturated solution, the dissolution process is
endothermic (Dsol H > 0), the solubility should increase with rise in
temperature and if it is exothermic (Dsol H < 0) the solubility should
decrease. These trends are also observed experimentally.

Effect of pressure

Pressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in
liquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible
and practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure.

1.3.2 Solubility of Many gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent
a Gas in a in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On

temperature. The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure.
For solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in
Fig. 1.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous
system at pressure p and temperature T. Assume this system to be in
a state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of
gaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same.
Now increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the
gas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of
gaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate
at which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to
enter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium
is reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the
solution and thus its solubility increases.

Henry was the first to give a
quantitative relation between
pressure and solubility of a gas in
a solvent which is known as
Henry’s law. The law states that
at a constant temperature, the
solubility of a gas in a liquid is
directly proportional to the
partial pressure of the gas
present above the surface of
liquid or solution. Dalton, a
contemporary of Henry, also

Fig. 1.1: Effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas. The concluded independently that the
concentration of dissolved gas is proportional to the solubility of a gas in a liquid

solution is a function of partial
pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in
the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be
said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is
proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over
the solution. The most commonly used form of Henry’s
law states that “the partial pressure of the gas in
vapour phase (p) is proportional to the mole fraction
of the gas (x) in the solution” and is expressed as:

p = KH x (1.11)

Here K  is the Henry’s law constant. If we draw a
H

graph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole
fraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot
of the type as shown in Fig. 1.2.

Different gases have different K  values at the same
H

temperature (Table 1.2). This suggests that K  is a
H

function of the nature of the gas.

It is obvious from equation (1.11) that higher the

aquatic species are more comfortable in cold waters rather than in
warm waters.

76.48 kbar.

Solution The solubility of gas is related to the mole fraction in aqueous solution.
The mole fraction of the gas in the solution is calculated by applying
Henry’s law. Thus:

p  (nitrogen) 0.987bar
x (Nitrogen)  =   =  = 1.29  10–5

Henry’s law finds several applications in industry and explains some
biological phenomena. Notable among these are:

· To increase the solubility of CO  in soft drinks and soda water, the
2

bottle is sealed under high pressure.

· Scuba divers must cope with high concentrations of dissolved gases
while breathing air at high pressure underwater. Increased pressure
increases the solubility of atmospheric gases in blood. When the
divers come towards surface, the pressure gradually decreases. This
releases the dissolved gases and leads to the formation of bubbles
of nitrogen in the blood. This blocks capillaries and creates a medical
condition known as bends, which are painful and dangerous to life.

Chemistry 8

Reprint 2025-26



To avoid bends, as well as, the toxic effects of high concentrations
of nitrogen in the blood, the tanks used by scuba divers are filled
with air diluted with helium (11.7% helium, 56.2% nitrogen and
32.1% oxygen).

· At high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen is less than that at
the ground level. This leads to low concentrations of oxygen in the
blood and tissues of people living at high altitudes or climbers. Low
blood oxygen causes climbers to become weak and unable to think
clearly, symptoms of a condition known as anoxia.

Effect of Temperature

Solubility of gases in liquids decreases with rise in temperature. When
dissolved, the gas molecules are present in liquid phase and the process
of dissolution can be considered similar to condensation and heat
is evolved in this process. We have learnt in the last Section that
dissolution process involves dynamic equilibrium and thus must
follow Le Chatelier’s Principle. As dissolution is an exothermic
process, the solubility should decrease with increase of
temperature.

Following conclusions can be drawn from equation (1.16).
(i) Total vapour pressure over the solution can be related to the mole

fraction of any one component.
(ii) Total vapour pressure over the solution varies linearly with the

mole fraction of component 2.
(iii) Depending on the vapour pressures

of the pure components 1 and 2,
total vapour pressure over the
solution decreases or increases with
the increase of the mole fraction of
component 1.

If we compare the equations for Raoult’s law and Henry’s law, it

Pressure of liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in
Solutions of water and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some
Solids in physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of
Liquids pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given

temperature vapourise and under
equilibrium conditions the pressure exerted
by the vapours of the liquid over the liquid
phase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)].
In a pure liquid the entire surface is
occupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a
non-volatile solute is added to a solvent to
give a solution [Fig. 1.4.(b)], the vapour
pressure of the solution is solely from the
solvent alone. This vapour pressure of the
solution at a given temperature is found to
be lower than the vapour pressure of the
pure solvent at the same temperature. In

pressure is also reduced.
The decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the

quantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of
its nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by
adding 1.0 mol of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that
produced by adding 1.0 mol of urea to the same quantity of water at
the same temperature.

Raoult’s law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution
the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the
solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction.

In a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by
2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are
present in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let p1 be

two other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the
pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume
of mixing is also zero, i.e.,

DmixH = 0, DmixV = 0 (1.21)

It means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components
are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of
volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of
the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and
B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will
be of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition
to these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present.
If the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are
nearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal
solution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly
ideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane
and chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category.

1.5.2 Non-ideal When a solution does not obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of
Solutions concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution. The vapour pressure

of such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by
Raoult’s law (equation 1.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive
deviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult’s
law. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions
for such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6.

The cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the
molecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult’s law, A-B
interactions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case
the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules
are weaker than  those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent
molecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will
find it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour

pressure and result in positive deviation. Mixtures of ethanol and acetone
behave in this manner. In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded.
On adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and
break some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of
interactions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult’s law
[Fig. 1.6 (a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to
acetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are
weaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and
solvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation.

In case of negative deviations from Raoult’s law, the intermolecular
attractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between
A-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative
deviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline.
In this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic
proton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the
respective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar
molecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone
forms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult’s law.
This is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen
bond with acetone molecule as shown.

This decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each
component and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting
in negative deviation from Raoult’s law [Fig. 1.6. (b)].

Some liquids on mixing, form azeotropes which are binary mixtures
having the same composition in liquid and vapour phase and boil at
a constant temperature. In such cases, it is not possible to separate the
components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes
called minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling
azeotrope. The solutions which show a large positive deviation from
Raoult’s law form minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition.

Chemistry 14

Reprint 2025-26



For example, ethanol-water mixture (obtained by fermentation of sugars)
on fractional distillation gives a solution containing approximately 95%
by volume of ethanol. Once this composition, known as azeotrope
composition, has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same
composition, and no further separation occurs.

The solutions that show large negative deviation from Raoult’s law
form maximum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. Nitric acid
and water is an example of this class of azeotrope. This azeotrope has
the approximate composition, 68% nitric acid and 32% water by mass,
with a boiling point of 393.5 K.

1 .6 Colligative We have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of solution
decreases when a non-volatile solute is added to a volatile solvent.

Properties and There are many properties of solutions which are connected with this

Determination decrease of vapour pressure. These are: (1) relative lowering of vapour
pressure of the solvent (2) depression of freezing point of the solvent

of Molar Mass (3) elevation of boiling point of the solvent and (4) osmotic pressure of
the solution. All these properties depend on the number of solute
particles irrespective of their nature relative to the total number
of particles present in the solution. Such properties are called
colligative properties (colligative: from Latin: co means together, ligare
means to bind). In the following Sections we will discuss these
properties one by one.

1.6.1 Relative We have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of a solvent in
Lowering of solution is less than that of the pure solvent. Raoult established that the
Vapour lowering of vapour pressure depends only on the concentration of the
Pressure solute particles and it is independent of their identity. The equation (1.20)

given in Section 1.4.3 establishes a relation between vapour pressure of
the solution, mole fraction and vapour pressure of the solvent, i.e.,

p = x  p 0 (1.22)
1 1 1

The reduction in the vapour pressure of solvent (Dp ) is given as:

Dp = p 0 – p  = p 0 – p 0 x
1 1 1 1 1 1

= p 0 (1 – x ) (1.23)
1 1

Knowing that x  = 1 – x , equation (1.23) reduces to
2 1

Dp = x  p 0 (1.24)
1 2 1

In a solution containing several non-volatile solutes, the lowering of the
vapour pressure depends on the sum of the mole fraction of different solutes.

The expression on the left hand side of the equation as mentioned
earlier is called relative lowering of vapour pressure and is equal to
the mole fraction of the solute. The above equation can be written as:

Example 1.6 The vapour pressure of pure benzene at a certain temperature is 0.850
bar. A non-volatile, non-electrolyte solid weighing 0.5 g when added to
39.0 g of benzene (molar mass 78 g mol-1). Vapour pressure of the solution,
then, is 0.845 bar. What is the molar mass of the solid substance?

Solution The various quantities known to us are as follows:

p  = 0.850 bar;  p = 0.845 bar;  M  = 78 g mol–1;  w  = 0.5 g;  w  = 39 g

Substituting these values in equation (2.28), we get

0.850 bar – 0.845 bar 0.5 g × 78 g mol–1  
= 

0.850 bar M2  × 39 g

Therefore, M  = 170 g mol–1

1.6.2 Elevation of The vapour pressure of a liquid increases with increase of
Boiling Point temperature. It boils at the temperature at which its vapour pressure

is equal to the atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at
373.15 K (100° C) because at this temperature the vapour pressure
of water is 1.013 bar (1 atmosphere). We have also learnt in the last
section that vapour pressure of the solvent decreases in the presence
of non-volatile solute. Fig. 1.7 depicts the variation of vapour pressure
of the pure solvent and solution as a function of temperature. For
example, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is
less than 1.013 bar at 373.15 K. In order to make this solution
boil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1.013 bar by
raising the temperature above the boiling temperature of
the pure solvent (water). Thus, the boiling point of a solution is

Chemistry 16

always higher than that of the boiling point of
the pure solvent in which the solution is prepared

1.013 bar as shown in Fig. 1.7. Similar to lowering of vapour
 or pressure, the elevation of boiling point also

depends on the number of solute molecules
rather than their nature. A solution of 1 mol of
sucrose in 1000 g of water boils at 373.52 K at
one atmospheric pressure.

1.6.3 Depression The lowering of vapour pressure of a solution causes a lowering of the
of Freezing freezing point compared to that of the pure solvent (Fig. 1.8). We know
Point that at the freezing point of a substance, the solid phase is in dynamic

equilibrium with the liquid phase. Thus, the
freezing point of a substance may be defined as
the temperature at which the vapour pressure of
the substance in its liquid phase is equal to its
vapour pressure in the solid phase. A solution
will freeze when its vapour pressure equals the
vapour pressure of the pure solid solvent as is
clear from Fig. 1.8. According to Raoult’s law,
when a non-volatile solid is added to the solvent
its vapour pressure decreases and now it would
become equal to that of solid solvent at lower
temperature. Thus, the freezing point of the
solvent decreases.

Pressure wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water, blood cells collapse

when suspended in saline water, etc. If we look into these processes we
find one thing common in all,

are bound by membranes.

molecules, like water, can pass through these holes but the passage of
bigger molecules like solute is hindered. Membranes having this kind
of properties are known as semipermeable membranes (SPM).

Assume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semi-
permeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent
and solution as shown in Fig. 1.9, the solvent molecules will flow through
the membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow
of the solvent is called osmosis.

The flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the
solvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane
can be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This
pressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic
pressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to
the concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to
osmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules
always flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution.
The osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration
of the solution.

 The osmotic pressure of a solution is the
excess pressure that must be applied to a
solution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the
passage of solvent molecules through a
semipermeable membrane into the solution. This
is illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Osmotic pressure is a
colligative property as it depends on the number
of solute molecules and not on their identity.
For dilute solutions, it has been found
experimentally that osmotic pressure is
proportional to the molarity, C of the
solution at a given temperature T. Thus:

P = C R T (1.39)

Measurement of osmotic pressure provides another method of
determining molar masses of solutes. This method is widely used to
determine molar masses of proteins, polymers and other

21 Solutions

Reprint 2025-26



macromolecules. The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over
other methods as pressure measurement is around the room
temperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality.
As compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large
even for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for
determination  of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for
biomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures
and polymers have poor solubility.

Two solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given
temperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions
are separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs
between them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated
with the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of
0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline
solution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if
we place the cells in a solution containing more than 0.9% (mass/
volume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they
would shrink. Such a solution is called hypertonic. If the salt
concentration is less than 0.9% (mass/volume), the solution is said
to be hypotonic. In this case, water will flow into the cells if placed
in this solution and they would swell.

Example 1.11 200 cm3 of an aqueous solution of a protein contains 1.26 g of the
protein. The osmotic pressure of such a solution at 300 K is found to
be 2.57 × 10-3 bar. Calculate the molar mass of the protein.

Solution The various quantities known to us are as follows: P = 2.57 × 10–3 bar,

V = 200 cm3 = 0.200 litre

T = 300 K

R = 0.083 L bar mol-1 K-1

Substituting these values in equation (2.42) we get

1.26 g × 0.083 L bar K 1  mol1 × 300 K
M  =   = 61,022 g mol-1

2 2.57×10 3bar × 0.200 L

The phenomena mentioned in the beginning of this section can be
explained on the basis of osmosis. A raw mango placed in concentrated
salt solution loses water via osmosis and shrivel into pickle. Wilted
flowers revive when placed in fresh water. A carrot that has become
limp because of water loss into the atmosphere can be placed into the
water making it firm once again. Water will move into its cells through
osmosis. When placed in water containing less than 0.9% (mass/
volume) salt, blood cells swell due to flow of water in them by osmosis.
People taking a lot of salt or salty food experience water retention in
tissue cells and intercellular spaces because of osmosis. The resulting

Chemistry 22

puffiness or swelling is called edema. Water movement from soil into
plant roots and subsequently into upper portion of the plant is partly
due to osmosis. The preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by
adding sugar protects against bacterial action. Through the process
of osmosis, a bacterium on salted meat or candid fruit loses water,
shrivels and dies.

1.6.5 Reverse The direction of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure larger than the
Osmosis and osmotic pressure is applied to the solution side. That is, now the
Water pure solvent flows out of the solution through the semi permeable
Purification membrane. This phenomenon is called reverse osmosis and is of

great practical utility. Reverse osmosis is used in desalination of sea
water. A schematic set up for the process is shown in Fig. 1.11.

When pressure more than osmotic pressure is
applied, pure water is squeezed out of the sea
water through the membrane. A variety of

Π polymer membranes are available for this
purpose.

The pressure required for the reverse osmosis
is quite high. A workable porous membrane is a
film of cellulose acetate placed over a suitable
support. Cellulose acetate is permeable to water
but impermeable to impurities and ions present

factor, to account for the extent of dissociation or association. This
factor i is defined as:

Normal molar mass
i 

Abnormal molar mass

Observed colligative property
  

Calculated colligative property

Total number of moles of particles after association/dissociation
i 

Number of moles of particles before association/dissociation

Here abnormal molar mass is the experimentally determined molar
mass and calculated colligative properties are obtained by assuming
that the non-volatile solute is neither associated nor dissociated. In
case of association, value of i is less than unity while for dissociation it
is greater than unity. For example, the value of i for aqueous KCl
solution is close to 2, while the value for ethanoic acid in benzene is
nearly 0.5.

Inclusion of van’t Hoff factor modifies the equations for colligative
properties as follows:

depression in freezing point equal to 1.62 K. Molal depression constant
for benzene is 4.9 K kg mol–1. What is the percentage association of acid

Summary
A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. Solutions are
classified as solid, liquid and gaseous solutions. The concentration of a solution is
expressed in terms of mole fraction, molarity, molality and in percentages. The
dissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry’s law, according to which, at a
given temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to
the partial pressure of the gas. The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by
the presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour
pressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult’s law, according to which the relative
lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole
fraction of a non-volatile solute present in the solution. However, in a binary
liquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another
form of Raoult’s law is used. Mathematically, this form of the Raoult’s law is stated

as: p 0 0
total  p x

1 1  p2x2 . Solutions which obey Raoult’s law over the entire range

of concentration are called ideal solutions. Two types of deviations from Raoult’s
law, called positive and negative deviations are observed. Azeotropes arise due to
very large deviations from Raoult’s law.

The properties of solutions which depend on the number of solute particles and
are independent of their chemical identity are called colligative properties. These
are lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing
point and osmotic pressure. The process of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure
higher than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution. Colligative properties
have been used to determine the molar mass of solutes. Solutes which dissociate in
solution exhibit molar mass lower than the actual molar mass and those which
associate show higher molar mass than their actual values.

Quantitatively, the extent to which a solute is dissociated or associated can be
expressed by van’t Hoff factor i. This factor has been defined as ratio of normal
molar mass to experimentally determined molar mass or as the ratio of observed
colligative property to the calculated colligative property.

potential equal to 1.1 V when concentration

Such a device is called a galvanic or a

If an external opposite potential is applied
in the galvanic cell [Fig. 2.2(a)] and increased
slowly, we find that the reaction continues to
take place till the opposing voltage reaches
the value 1.1 V [Fig. 2.2(b)] when, the reaction
stops altogether and no current flows through

2.2 Galvanic Cells As mentioned earlier a galvanic cell is an electrochemical cell that
converts the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction into
electrical energy. In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous
redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for
running a motor or other electrical gadgets  like heater, fan,
geyser, etc.

Daniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following
redox reaction occurs.

Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)
This reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition

gives the overall cell reaction:

(i) Cu2+   +  2e–    ® Cu(s) (reduction half reaction) (2.2)
(ii) Zn(s)  ® Zn2+ + 2e– (oxidation half reaction) (2.3)

These reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell.
The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the
oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions
of the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper
electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode,
the oxidation half-cell.

We can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern
of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each half-
cell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two
half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a
switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected
internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1.  Sometimes, both
the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we
do not require a salt bridge.

At each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal
ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make
it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode
have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the
electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At
equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the
tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively
or negatively charged with  respect to the solution. A potential difference
develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called
electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved
in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard
electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard
reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a
galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode
and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other
half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a
positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a
potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the
switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode
to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of
electron flow.

The potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic
cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell
potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction
potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive
force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It
is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and
the cathode on the right  while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic
cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal
and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between
the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention
the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the half-
cell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the
left hand side i.e.,

E = E – E
cell right  left

This is illustrated by the following example:

Cell reaction:
Cu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) ¾® Cu2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s) (2.4)

Half-cell reactions:
Cathode (reduction):   2Ag+(aq) + 2e– ® 2Ag(s) (2.5)
Anode (oxidation):    Cu(s)  ® Cu2+(aq) + 2e– (2.6)

It can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction
(2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper
electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as:

Cu(s)|Cu2+(aq)||Ag+(aq)|Ag(s)
and we have E  = E  – E  = E (

Measurement measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that
of Electrode gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one
Potential electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect

to this. According to convention, a half-cell

    H+ (aq) + e–  ®  H (g)

The standard hydrogen electrode consists
of a platinum electrode coated with platinum
black. The electrode is dipped in an acidic
solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled
through it.  The concentration of both the
reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is
maintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies
that the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar
and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the

Similarly, the measured emf of the cell:

The positive  value of the standard electrode potential in the first

case indicates that Cu  ions get reduced more easily than H  ions. The
reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu
(or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion)
under the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not
dissolve in HCl.  In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by
hydrogen ion.  The negative value of the standard electrode potential
in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or
zinc can reduce hydrogen ions).

In view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in
Fig. 2.1 can be written as:

Left electrode: Zn(s) ® + –

 Zn  (aq, 1 M) + 2 e

The standard electrode potentials are very important and we can
extract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard
electrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are
given in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode
is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to
hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative
then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species.
It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the
highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F ) has the maximum

2
tendency to get reduced to fluoride ions (F–) and therefore fluorine
gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest
reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating
that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is
the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be
seen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard
electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising
power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of
the species on the right hand side of the reaction. Electrochemical
cells are extensively used for determining the pH of solutions, solubility
product, equilibrium constant and other thermodynamic properties
and for potentiometric titrations.

2.4 Conductance It is necessary to define a few terms before we consider the subject of

of Electrolytic conductance of electricity through electrolytic solutions. The electrical
resistance is represented by the symbol ‘R’ and it is measured in ohm (W)

Solutions which in terms of SI base units is equal to (kg m2)/( 3
S  2

A ). It can be
measured with the help of a Wheatstone bridge with which you are
familiar from your study of physics. The electrical resistance of any object
is directly proportional to its length, l, and inversely proportional to its
area of cross section, A. That is,

l l
R µ  or R = r (2.17)

A A

The constant of proportionality, r (Greek, rho), is called resistivity
(specific resistance). Its SI units are ohm metre (W m) and quite often
its submultiple, ohm centimetre (W cm) is also used. IUPAC recommends
the use of the term resistivity over specific resistance and hence in the
rest of the book we shall use the term resistivity. Physically, the resistivity
for a substance is its resistance when it is one metre long and its area
of cross section is one m2. It can be seen that:

1 W m = 100 W cm or 1 W cm = 0.01 W m
The inverse of resistance, R, is called conductance, G, and we have

the relation:

1 A
G = = = κ A

(2.18)
R ρl l

The SI unit of conductance is siemens, represented by the symbol
‘S’ and is equal to ohm–1 (also known as mho) or –1

W . The inverse of
resistivity, called conductivity (specific conductance) is represented by
the symbol, k (Greek, kappa). IUPAC has recommended the use of term
conductivity over specific conductance and hence we shall use the term
conductivity in the rest of the book. The SI units of conductivity are
S m–1 but quite often, k is expressed in S cm–1. Conductivity of a
material in S m–1 is its conductance when it is 1 m long and its area
of cross section is 1 m2. It may be noted that 1 S cm–1 = 100 S m–1.

It can be seen from Table 2.2 that the magnitude of conductivity
varies a great deal and depends on the nature of the material. It also
depends on the temperature and pressure at which the measurements
are made. Materials are classified into conductors, insulators and
semiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity. Metals
and their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors.
Certain non-metals like carbon-black, graphite and some organic
polymers* are also electronically conducting. Substances like glass,
ceramics, etc., having very low conductivity are known as insulators.
Substances like silicon, doped silicon and gallium arsenide having
conductivity between conductors and insulators are called
semiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials
called superconductors by definition have zero resistivity or infinite
conductivity. Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures
(0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a
number of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show
superconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K.

Electrical conductance through metals is called metallic or electronic
conductance and is due to the movement of electrons. The electronic
conductance depends on

(i) the nature and structure of the metal
(ii) the number of valence electrons per atom
(iii) temperature (it decreases with increase of temperature).

* Electronically conducting polymers – In 1977 MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa discovered that acetylene gas can be
polymerised to produce a polymer, polyacetylene when exposed to vapours of iodine acquires metallic lustre and
conductivity. Since then several organic conducting polymers have been made such as polyaniline, polypyrrole and
polythiophene. These organic polymers which have properties like metals, being composed wholly of elements like
carbon, hydrogen and occasionally nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur, are much lighter than normal metals and can be used
for making light-weight batteries. Besides, they have the mechanical properties of polymers such as flexibility so that
one can make electronic devices such as transistors that can bend like a sheet of plastic. For the discovery of conducting
polymers, MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2000.

As the electrons enter at one end and go out through the other end,
the composition of the metallic conductor remains unchanged. The
mechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex.

We already know that even very pure water has small amounts of
hydrogen and hydroxyl ions (~10–7M) which lend it very low conductivity
(3.5 × 10–5 S m–1). When electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish
their own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases. The
conductance of electricity by ions present in the solutions is called
electrolytic or ionic conductance. The conductivity of electrolytic (ionic)
solutions depends on:

(i) the nature of the electrolyte added
(ii) size of the ions produced and their solvation
(iii) the nature of the solvent and its viscosity
(iv) concentration of the electrolyte
(v) temperature (it increases with the increase of temperature).

Passage of direct current through ionic solution over a prolonged
period can lead to change in its composition due to electrochemical
reactions (Section 2.4.1).

2.4.1 Measurement We know that accurate measurement of an unknown resistance can be
of the performed on a Wheatstone bridge. However, for measuring the resistance
Conductivity of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current
of Ionic (DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution  cannot
Solutions be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor.

The first difficulty is resolved by using an alternating current (AC) source
of power. The second problem is solved by using a specially designed
vessel called conductivity cell. It is available in several designs and two
simple ones are shown in Fig. 2.4.

Basically it consists of two platinum electrodes coated with platinum
black (finely divided metallic Pt is deposited on the electrodes

separated by distance ‘l’. Therefore, solution confined between these

The quantity l/A is called cell constant denoted by the symbol, G*.
It depends on the distance between the electrodes and their area of
cross-section and has the dimension of length–1 and can be calculated
if we know l and A. Measurement of l and A is not only inconvenient
but also unreliable. The cell constant is usually determined by measuring
the resistance of the cell containing a solution whose conductivity is
already known. For this purpose, we generally use KCl solutions whose
conductivity is known accurately at various concentrations (Table 2.3)
and at different temperatures. The cell constant, G*, is then given by
the equation:

through the detector. Under these conditions:

which the ions move under a potential gradient. It, therefore, becomes
necessary to define a physically more meaningful quantity called molar
conductivity denoted by the symbol Lm (Greek, lambda). It is related
to the conductivity of the solution by the equation:


Molar conductivity = Lm = (2.21)

c
In the above equation, if k is expressed in S m–1 and the concentration,

c in mol m–3 then the units of Lm are in S m2 mol–1. It may be noted that:
1 mol m–3 = 1000(L/m3) × molarity (mol/L), and hence

  (S cm1 )
L (S cm2 mol–1) = 

m 1000 L m3  × molarity (mol L1 )

If we use S cm–1 as the units for k and mol cm–3, the units of
concentration, then the units for L  are S cm2 mol–1. It can be calculated

m
by using the equation:

  (S cm1 ) × 1000 (cm3 /L)
Lm (S cm2 mol–1) = 

molarity (mol/L)
Both type of units are used in literature and are related to each

other by the equations:

1 S cm2mol–1 = 10–4 S m2mol–1.

2.4.2 Variation of Both conductivity and molar conductivity change with the
Conductivity concentration of the electrolyte. Conductivity always decreases with
and Molar decrease in concentration both, for weak and strong electrolytes.
Conductivity This can be explained by the fact that the number of ions per unit

of unit length. This is clear from the equation:

Molar conductivity of a solution at a given concentration is the
conductance of the volume V of solution containing one mole of

Since l = 1 and A = V ( volume containing 1 mole of electrolyte)

Lm = k V (2.22)

Molar conductivity increases with
decrease in concentration. This is
because the total volume, V, of solution
containing one mole of electrolyte also
increases. It has been found that decrease
in k on dilution of a solution is more
than compensated by increase in its
volume. Physically, it means that at a
given concentration, L  can be defined

solution. Thus, NaCl, CaCl , MgSO are known as 1-1, 2-1 and 2-2

Kohlrausch examined °
Lm  values for a number of strong electrolytes

and observed certain regularities. He noted that the difference in L°

m (NaBr) m (NaCl) m (KBr) m (KCl)

On the basis of the above observations he enunciated Kohlrausch
law of independent migration of ions. The law states that limiting
molar conductivity of an electrolyte can be represented as the sum of the
individual contributions of the anion and cation of the electrolyte. Thus,
if °

l + and °
l – are limiting molar  conductivity of the sodium and chloride

Na  Cl

is given by the equation:

Weak Electrolytes

Weak electrolytes like acetic acid have lower degree of dissociation at
higher concentrations and hence for such electrolytes, the change in Lm

with dilution is due to increase in the degree of dissociation and
consequently the number of ions in total volume of solution that contains
1 mol of electrolyte. In such cases Lm increases steeply (Fig. 2.6) on
dilution, especially near lower concentrations. Therefore, °

Lm  cannot be
obtained by extrapolation of Lm to zero concentration. At infinite dilution
(i.e., concentration c ® zero) electrolyte dissociates completely (a =1),
but at such low concentration the conductivity of the solution is so low
that it cannot be measured accurately. Therefore, °

Lm  for weak electrolytes
is obtained by using Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions
(Example 2.8). At any concentration c, if a is the degree of dissociation

2.5 Electrolytic In an electrolytic cell external source of voltage is used to bring about

Cells and a chemical reaction. The electrochemical processes are of great importance
in the laboratory and the chemical industry. One of the simplest electrolytic

Electrolysis cell consists of two copper strips dipping in an aqueous solution of
copper sulphate. If a DC voltage is applied to the two electrodes, then
Cu 2+ ions discharge at the cathode (negatively charged) and the following
reaction takes place:

Cu2+(aq) + 2e– ® Cu (s) (2.28)
Copper metal is deposited on the cathode. At the anode, copper is

converted into Cu2+ ions by the reaction:
Cu(s) ® Cu2+(s) + 2e– (2.29)

Thus copper is dissolved (oxidised) at anode and deposited
(reduced) at cathode. This is the basis for an industrial process in
which impure copper is converted into copper of high purity. The
impure copper is made an anode that dissolves on passing current
and pure copper is deposited at the cathode. Many metals like Na, Mg,
Al, etc. are produced on large scale by electrochemical reduction of
their respective cations where no suitable chemical reducing agents
are available for this purpose.

Sodium and magnesium metals are produced by the electrolysis of
their fused chlorides and aluminium is produced by electrolysis of
aluminium oxide in presence of cryolite.

Quantitative Aspects of Electrolysis

Michael Faraday was the first scientist who described the quantitative
aspects of electrolysis. Now Faraday’s laws also flow from what has
been discussed earlier.

Faraday’s Laws of Electrolysis

After his extensive investigations on electrolysis of solutions and melts
of electrolytes, Faraday published his results during 1833-34 in the
form of the following well known Faraday’s two laws of electrolysis:

(i) First Law: The amount of chemical reaction which occurs at any
electrode during electrolysis by a current is proportional to the
quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte (solution or
melt).

(ii) Second Law: The amounts of different substances liberated by the
same quantity of electricity passing through the electrolytic solution
are proportional to their chemical equivalent weights (Atomic Mass
of Metal ÷ Number of electrons required to reduce the cation).

51 Electrochemistry

Reprint 2025-26



There were no constant current sources available during Faraday’s
times. The general practice was to put a coulometer (a standard electrolytic
cell) for determining the quantity of electricity  passed from the amount
of metal (generally silver or copper) deposited or consumed. However,
coulometers are now obsolete and we now have constant current (I)
sources available and the quantity of electricity Q, passed is given by

Q = It
Q is in coloumbs when I is in ampere and t is in second.
The amount of electricity (or charge) required for oxidation or

reduction depends on the stoichiometry of the electrode reaction. For
example, in the reaction:

Ag +(aq) + e– ® Ag(s) (2.30)
One mole of the electron is required for the reduction of one mole

of silver ions.
We know that charge on one electron is equal to 1.6021 × 10–19C.
Therefore, the charge on one mole of electrons is equal to:

N × 1.6021 × 10–19 C = 6.02 × 1023 mol–1
× 1.6021 × 10–19

A 

C = 96487 C mol–1

This quantity of electricity is called Faraday and is represented by
the symbol F.

For approximate calculations we use 1F ≃ 96500 C mol–1.
For the electrode reactions:

Mg2+(l) + 2e– ¾® Mg(s) (2.31)

Al3+(l) + 3e– ¾® Al(s) (2.32)
It is obvious that one mole of Mg2+ and Al3+ require 2 mol of electrons

(2F) and 3 mol of electrons (3F) respectively. The charge passed through
the electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current
in amperes and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals,
current as high as 50,000 amperes are used that amounts to about
0.518 F per second.

Example 2.10 A solution of CuSO  is electrolysed for 10 minutes with a current of
4

1.5 amperes. What is the mass of copper deposited at the cathode?

Solution t = 600 s  charge = current × time = 1.5 A × 600 s = 900 C
According to the reaction:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e– = Cu(s)
We require 2F or 2 × 96487 C to deposit 1 mol or 63 g of Cu.
For 900 C, the mass of Cu deposited

= (63 g mol–1
 × 900 C)/(2 × 96487 C mol–1) = 0.2938 g.

2.5.1 Products of Products of electrolysis depend on the nature of material being
Electrolysis electrolysed and the type of electrodes being used. If the electrode is

inert (e.g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical
reaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons. On the other
hand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction.
Thus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert

Chemistry 52

electrodes.The products of electrolysis depend on the different oxidising
and reducing species present in the electrolytic cell and their standard
electrode potentials. Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes
although feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these do
not seem to take place and extra potential (called overpotential) has to
be applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur.

For example, if we use molten NaCl, the products of electrolysis are
sodium metal and Cl  gas. Here we have only one cation (Na+) which is

2
reduced at the cathode (Na+ + e– ® Na) and one anion (Cl–) which is
oxidised at the anode (Cl– ® ½Cl + e– ) . During the electrolysis of aqueous

2 
sodium chloride solution, the products are NaOH, Cl  and H . In this

2 2
case besides Na+ and Cl– ions we also have H+ and OH– ions along with
the solvent molecules, H O.

At the cathode there is competition between the following reduction
reactions:

Na+ (aq) + e– ® Na (s) Eo
( )  = – 2.71 V
cell

H+ (aq) + e– ® ½ H  (g) Eo

The reaction with higher value of Eo is preferred and therefore, the
reaction at the cathode during electrolysis is:

H+ (aq) + e– ® ½ H  (g) (2.33)
2

but H+ (aq) is produced by the dissociation of H O, i.e.,
2

H O (l ) +
® H  (aq) + OH– (aq) (2.34)

2

Therefore, the net reaction at the cathode may be written as the sum
of (2.33) and (2.34) and we have

H O (l ) + e– ® ½H (g) + OH– (2.35)
2 2

At the anode the following oxidation reactions are possible:

Cl– (aq) ® ½ Cl  (g) + e– Eo

2

2H O (l ) ® O (g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e– Eo
(  = 1.

2 2 cell) 23 V (2.37)

The reaction at anode with lower value of E o  is preferred and
therefore, water should get oxidised in preference to Cl– (aq). However,
on account of overpotential of oxygen, reaction (2.36) is preferred. Thus,
the net reactions may be summarised as:

NaCl (aq) H2O→  Na+ (aq) + Cl– (aq)
Cathode: H O(l ) + e– ® ½ H (g) + OH– (aq)

2.6 Batteries Any battery (actually it may have one or more than one cell connected
in series) or cell that we use as a source of electrical energy is basically
a galvanic cell where the chemical energy of the redox reaction is
converted into electrical energy. However, for a battery to be of practical
use it should be reasonably light, compact and its voltage should not
vary appreciably during its use. There are mainly two types of batteries.

2.6.1 Primary In the primary batteries, the reaction occurs only once and after use
Batteries over a period of time battery becomes dead and cannot be reused

again. The most familiar example of this type is the dry
cell (known as Leclanche cell after its discoverer) which is
used commonly in our transistors and clocks. The cell
consists of a zinc container that also acts as anode and
the cathode is a carbon (graphite) rod surrounded by
powdered manganese dioxide and carbon (Fig.2.8). The
space between the electrodes is filled by a moist paste of
ammonium chloride (NH Cl) and zinc chloride (ZnCl ). The

4 2
electrode reactions are complex, but they can be written
approximately as follows :

Anode: Zn(s) ¾® Zn2+ + 2e–

Cathode: MnO + NH ++ e–
¾® MnO(OH) + NH

2 4 3

In the reaction at cathode, manganese is reduced
from the + 4 oxidation state to the +3 state. Ammonia
produced in the reaction forms a complex with Zn2+ to give
[Zn (NH ) ]2+. The cell has a potential of nearly 1.5 V.

Mercury cell, (Fig. 2.9) suitable for low current devices
like hearing aids, watches, etc. consists of zinc – mercury
amalgam as anode and a paste of HgO and carbon as the

2.6.2 Secondary A secondary cell after use can be recharged by passing current
Batteries through it in the opposite direction so that it can be used again. A

good secondary cell can undergo a large number of discharging
and charging cycles. The most important secondary cell is the lead
storage battery (Fig. 2.10) commonly used in automobiles and
invertors. It consists of a lead anode and a grid of lead packed with
lead dioxide (PbO ) as cathode. A 38% solution of sulphuric acid

2 
is used as an electrolyte.

The cell reactions when the battery is in use are given below:

Anode: Pb(s) + SO 2–(aq) ® PbSO (s) + 2e–

Cathode: PbO (s) + SO 2–(aq) + 4H+(aq) + 2e– ® PbSO  (s) + 2H O (l )

i.e., overall cell reaction consisting of cathode and anode reactions is:

Pb(s) + PbO (s) + 2H SO (aq) ® 2PbSO (s) + 2H O(l)
2 2 4 4 2

On charging the battery the reaction is reversed and PbSO (s) on

anode and cathode is converted into Pb and PbO , respectively.

2.7 Fuel Cells Production of electricity by thermal plants is not a very efficient method
and is a major source of pollution. In such plants, the chemical energy
(heat of combustion) of fossil fuels (coal, gas or oil) is first used for
converting water into high pressure steam. This is then used to run
a turbine to produce electricity. We know that a galvanic cell directly
converts chemical energy into electricity and is highly efficient. It is
now possible to make such cells in which reactants are fed continuously
to the electrodes and products are removed continuously from the
electrolyte compartment. Galvanic cells that are designed to convert
the energy of combustion of fuels like hydrogen, methane, methanol,
etc. directly into electrical energy are called fuel cells.

One of the most successful fuel cells
uses the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen
to form water (Fig. 2.12). The cell was
used for providing electrical power in the
Apollo space programme. The water
vapours produced during the reaction
were condensed and added to the
drinking water supply for the astronauts.
In the cell, hydrogen and oxygen are
bubbled through porous carbon
electrodes into concentrated aqueous
sodium hydroxide solution. Catalysts like
finely divided platinum or palladium
metal are incorporated into the electrodes
for increasing the rate of electrode

2.8 Corrosion Corrosion slowly coats the surfaces of metallic objects with oxides or
other salts of the metal. The rusting of iron, tarnishing of silver,
development of green coating on copper and bronze are some of the

examples of corrosion. It causes enormous damage to
buildings, bridges, ships and to all objects made of
metals especially that of iron. We lose crores of rupees
every year on account of corrosion.

In corrosion, a metal is oxidised by loss of electrons
to oxygen and formation of oxides. Corrosion of iron
(commonly known as rusting) occurs in presence of
water and air. The chemistry of corrosion is quite

complex but it may be considered

Electrons released at anodic spot move through the metal and go
to another spot on the metal and reduce oxygen in the presence of H+

(which is believed to be available from H CO formed due to dissolution
2 3 

of carbon dioxide from air into water. Hydrogen ion in water may also
be available due to dissolution of other acidic oxides from the
atmosphere). This spot behaves as cathode with the reaction

The ferrous ions are further oxidised by atmospheric oxygen to
ferric ions which come out as rust in the form of hydrated ferric oxide
(Fe O . x H O) and with further production of hydrogen ions.

2 3 2

Prevention of corrosion is of prime importance. It not only saves
money but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse
or failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest
methods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic
object to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering
the surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another
simple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that
are inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to
provide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which
corrodes itself but saves the object.

The Hydrogen Economy
At present the main source of energy that is driving our economy is fossil fuels
such as coal, oil and gas. As more people on the planet aspire to improve their
standard of living, their energy requirement will increase. In fact, the per
capita consumption of energy used is a measure of development. Of course, it
is assumed that energy is used for productive purpose and not merely wasted.
We are already aware that carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil
fuels is resulting in the ‘Greenhouse Effect’. This is leading to a rise in the
temperature of the Earth’s surface, causing polar ice to melt and ocean levels
to rise. This will flood low-lying areas along the coast and some island nations
such as Maldives face total submergence. In order to avoid such a catastrope,
we need to limit our use of carbonaceous fuels. Hydrogen provides an ideal
alternative as its combustion results in water only. Hydrogen production must
come from splitting water using solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen can be used
as a renewable and non polluting source of energy. This is the vision of the
Hydrogen Economy. Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water
and hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future. And
both these technologies are based on electrochemical principles.

Summary
An electrochemical cell consists of two metallic electrodes dipping in electrolytic
solution(s). Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic
conductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell,
the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical
work, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a non-
spontaneous redox reaction. The standard electrode potential for any electrode
dipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode
potential of hydrogen electrode taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell
can be obtained by taking the difference of the standard potentials of cathode and

o
anode ( E  = o

( ) E  – o

cell cathode anode). The standard potential of the cells are

related to standard Gibbs energy ( o o
DrG  = –nF E( ) and equil

cell) ibrium constant
( o
DrG  = – RT ln K) of the reaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence
of the potentials of the  electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation.

The conductivity, k, of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration
of the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity, Lm, is
defined by = k/c where c is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar
conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with
decrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep
for weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions. Kohlrausch found that molar
conductivity at infinite dilution, for an electrolyte is sum of the contribution of the

Chemistry 58

Reprint 2025-26



molar conductivity of the ions in which it dissociates. It is known as law of
independent migration of ions and has many applications. Ions conduct electricity
through the solution but oxidation and reduction of the ions take place at the
electrodes in an electrochemical cell. Batteries and fuel cells are very useful
forms of galvanic cell. Corrosion of metals is essentially an electrochemical
phenomenon. Electrochemical principles are relevant to the Hydrogen Economy.

Or what controls the rate at which fuel burns in an

the branch of chemistry, which deals with the study
of reaction rates and their mechanisms, called
chemical kinetics. The word kinetics is derived from
the Greek word ‘kinesis’ meaning movement.
Thermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a
reaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate
of a reaction.  For example, thermodynamic data
indicate that diamond shall convert to graphite but
in reality the conversion rate is so slow that the change
is not perceptible at all. Therefore, most people think

Reprint 2025-26



that diamond is forever. Kinetic studies not only help us to determine
the speed or rate of a chemical reaction but also describe the
conditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors
such as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the
rate of a reaction. At the macroscopic level, we are interested in
amounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or
formation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving
orientation and energy of molecules undergoing collisions,
are discussed.

In this Unit, we shall be dealing with average and instantaneous
rate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary
ideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given.
However, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the
reaction rate.

3 . 1 Rate of a Some reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example,

Chemical precipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of
aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride. On the other

Reaction hand, some reactions are very slow, for example, rusting of iron in
the presence of air and moisture. Also there are reactions like inversion
of cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate
speed. Can you think of more examples from each category?

You must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in
terms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain
period of time. Similarly, the speed of  a reaction or  the rate of a
reaction can be defined as the change in concentration of  a reactant
or product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in
terms of:

(i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the
reactants, or

(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products.
Consider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the

system remains constant.
R ® P

One mole of the reactant R produces one mole of the product P. If
[R]   and [P]  are the concentrations of R and P respectively at time t

Since, D[R] is a negative quantity (as concentration of reactants is

positive quantity.

a reaction, r .

Average rate depends upon the change in concentration of reactants
or products and the time taken for that change to occur (Fig. 3.1).

Units of rate of a reaction

From equations (3.1) and (3.2), it is clear that units of rate are
concentration time–1. For example, if concentration is in  mol L–1  and
time is in seconds then the units will be mol L-1s–1. However, in gaseous
reactions, when the concentration of gases is expressed in terms of their
partial pressures, then the units of the rate equation will be atm s–1.

We can determine the difference in concentration over different intervals Solution

It can be seen (Table 3.1) that the average rate falls from 1.90 ×  0-4 mol L-1s-1 to
0.4 × 10-4 mol L-1s-1. However, average rate cannot be used to predict the
rate of a reaction at a particular instant as it would be constant for the
time interval for which it is calculated. So, to express the rate at a particular
moment of time we determine the instantaneous rate. It is obtained
when we consider the average rate at the smallest time interval say dt ( i.e.
when Dt approaches zero). Hence, mathematically for an infinitesimally
small dt instantaneous rate is given by

It can be determined graphically by drawing a tangent at time t on

Now consider a reaction

HI decompose to produce one mole each of H and I

2 2,

2HI(g)   ® H (g)   +   I (g)
   2 2

For expressing the rate of such a reaction where stoichiometric
coefficients of reactants or products are not equal to one, rate of
disappearance of any of the reactants or  the rate of appearance of
products is divided by their respective stoichiometric coefficients. Since
rate of consumption of HI is twice the rate of formation of H  or I , to

2 2
make them equal, the term D[HI]  is divided by 2. The rate of this reaction
is given by

This form of equation (3.4 b) is known as differential rate equation,
where  k is a proportionality constant called rate constant. The
equation like (3.4), which relates the rate of a reaction to concentration
of reactants is called rate law or rate expression. Thus, rate law is the
expression in which reaction rate is given in terms of molar
concentration of reactants with each term raised to some
power, which may or may not be same as the stoichiometric
coefficient of the reacting species in a balanced chemical
equation. For example:

2NO(g) + O (g) ® 2NO  (g)
2 2

We can measure the rate of this reaction as a function of initial
concentrations either by keeping the concentration of one of the reactants
constant and changing the concentration of the other reactant or by
changing the concentration of both the reactants. The following results
are obtained (Table 3.2).

of NO is doubled and that of O  is kept constant then the initial rate

increases by a factor of four from 0.096 to 0.384 mol L–1s–1. This
indicates that the rate depends upon the square of the concentration of
NO.  When concentration of NO is kept constant and concentration of
O  is doubled the rate also gets doubled indicating that rate depends

2
on concentration of O to the first power.  Hence, the rate equation for

2 
this reaction will be

Rate = k [NO] [O2]

The differential form of this rate expression is given as

− d[R] = k [ ]2NO [O2 ]
dt

Now, we observe that for this reaction in the rate equation derived
from the experimental data, the exponents of the concentration terms
are the same as their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced
chemical equation.

Some other examples are given below:
Reaction Experimental rate expression
1. CHCl  + Cl  ®  CCl  + HCl Rate = k [CHCl  ]  [Cl ]1/2

2. CH COOC H  + H O ®  CH COOH + C H OH Rate = k [CH COOC H ]1 [H O]0
3 2 5 2 3 2 5 3 2 5 2

In these reactions, the exponents of the concentration terms are not
the same as their stoichiometric coefficients. Thus, we can say that:

Rate law for any reaction cannot be predicted by merely looking at
the balanced chemical equation, i.e., theoretically but must be determined
experimentally.

3.2.3 Order of a In the rate equation (3.4)
Reaction Rate = k [A]x  [B]y

x and y indicate how sensitive the rate is to the change in concentration
of A and B.  Sum of these exponents, i.e., x + y in (3.4) gives the overall
order of a reaction whereas x and y represent the order with respect
to the reactants A and B respectively.

Hence, the sum of powers of the concentration of the
reactants in the rate law expression is called the order of that
chemical reaction.

Order of a reaction can be 0, 1, 2, 3 and even a fraction. A zero
order reaction means that the rate of reaction is independent of the
concentration of reactants.

Example 3.3 Calculate the overall order of a reaction which
has the rate expression
(a) Rate = k [A]1/2 [B]3/2

(b) Rate = k [A]3/2 [B]–1

Solution
(a) Rate = k [A]x  [B]y

order = x + y
So order = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2, i.e., second order

(b) order = 3/2 + (–1) = 1/2,  i.e., half order.

A balanced chemical equation never gives us a true picture of how
a reaction takes place since rarely a reaction gets completed in one
step.  The reactions taking place in one step are called elementary
reactions.  When a sequence of elementary reactions (called mechanism)
gives us the products, the reactions are called complex reactions.

These may be consecutive reactions (e.g., oxidation of ethane to CO2

and H2O passes through a series of intermediate steps in which alcohol,

3.2.4 Molecularity Another property of a reaction called molecularity helps in
of a understanding its mechanism.   The number of reacting species
Reaction (atoms, ions or molecules) taking part in an elementary

reaction, which must collide simultaneously in order to bring
about a chemical reaction is called molecularity of a reaction.
The reaction can be unimolecular when one reacting species is involved,
for example, decomposition of ammonium nitrite.

Bimolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between two
species, for example, dissociation of hydrogen iodide.

2HI ® H  + I
2 2

Trimolecular or termolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision
between three reacting species, for example,

2NO + O  ® 2NO
2 2

The probability that more than three molecules can collide and
react simultaneously is very small.  Hence, reactions with the
molecularity three are very rare and slow to proceed.

It is, therefore, evident that complex reactions involving more than
three molecules in the stoichiometric equation must take place in more
than one step.

This reaction which apparently seems to be of tenth order is actually
a second order reaction. This shows that this reaction takes place in
several steps. Which step controls the rate of the overall reaction? The
question can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction,
for example, chances to win the relay race competition by a team
depend upon the slowest person in the team.  Similarly, the overall rate
of the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the
rate determining step. Consider the decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide which is catalysed by iodide ion in an alkaline medium.

This reaction is first order with respect to both H O  and I–.  Evidences

suggest that this reaction takes place in two steps

(1) H O + I– ® H O + IO–
2 2  2

(2) H O + IO– ® H O + I– + O
2 2  2 2

Both the steps are bimolecular elementary reactions. Species IO- is
called as an intermediate since it is formed during the course of the
reaction but not in the overall balanced equation. The first step, being
slow, is the rate determining step.  Thus, the rate of formation of
intermediate will determine the rate of this reaction.
Thus, from the discussion, till now, we conclude the following:

(i) Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity. It can be zero and
even a fraction but molecularity cannot be zero or a non integer.

(ii) Order is applicable to elementary as well as complex reactions
whereas molecularity is applicable only for elementary reactions.
For complex reaction molecularity has no meaning.

(iii) For complex reaction, order is given by the slowest step and
molecularity of the slowest step is same as the order of the overall
reaction.

Rate called differential rate equation. It is not always convenient to

Equations of slope of the tangent at point ‘t’ in concentration vs time plot
(Fig. 3.1).  This makes it difficult to determine the rate law and hence
the order of the reaction. In order to avoid this difficulty, we can
integrate the differential rate equation to give a relation between directly
measured experimental data, i.e., concentrations at different times
and rate constant.

The integrated rate equations are different for the reactions of different
reaction orders.  We shall determine these equations only for zero and

In this reaction, platinum metal acts as a catalyst. At high pressure,
the metal surface gets saturated with gas molecules. So, a further
change in reaction conditions is unable to alter the amount of ammonia
on the surface of the catalyst making rate of the reaction independent
of its concentration. The thermal decomposition of HI on gold surface
is another example of zero order reaction.

The order of a reaction is sometimes altered by conditions.  There
are many reactions which obey first order rate law although they are
higher order reactions. Consider the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate which
is a chemical reaction between ethyl acetate and water. In reality, it
is a second order reaction and concentration of both ethyl acetate and
water affect the rate of the reaction. But water is taken in large excess
for hydrolysis, therefore, concentration of water is not altered much
during the reaction. Thus, the rate of reaction is affected by
concentration of ethyl acetate only. For example, during the hydrolysis
of 0.01 mol of ethyl acetate with 10 mol of water, amounts of the
reactants and products at the beginning (t = 0) and completion (t) of
the reaction are given as under.

3.4.1 Effect of A catalyst is a substance which increases the rate of a reaction without
Catalyst itself undergoing any permanent chemical change. For example, MnO

2
catalyses the following reaction so as to increase its rate considerably.

2KClO  MnO
3 2  2 KCl + 3O

2

The word catalyst should not be used when the added substance
reduces the rate of raction. The substance is then called inhibitor. The
action of the catalyst can be explained by intermediate complex theory.
According to this theory, a catalyst participates in a chemical reaction by
forming temporary bonds with the reactants resulting in an intermediate
complex. This has a transitory existence and decomposes to yield products
and the catalyst.

It is believed that the catalyst provides an
alternate pathway or reaction mechanism by
reducing the activation energy between
reactants and products and hence lowering
the potential energy barrier as shown in
Fig. 3.11.

It is clear from Arrhenius equation (3.18)
that lower the value of activation energy faster
will be the rate of a reaction.

A small amount of the catalyst can catalyse

Fig. 3.11: Effect of catalyst on activation a large amount of reactants. A catalyst does
energy not alter Gibbs energy, DG of a reaction.  It

catalyses the spontaneous reactions but does
not catalyse non-spontaneous reactions. It is

also found that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant of
a reaction rather, it helps in attaining the equilibrium faster, that is, it
catalyses the forward as well as the backward reactions to the same
extent so that the equilibrium state remains same but is reached earlier.

3.5 Collision Though Arrhenius equation is applicable under a wide range of
Theory of circumstances, collision theory, which was developed by Max  Trautz

Chemical and William Lewis in 1916 -18, provides a greater insight into the
energetic and mechanistic aspects of reactions. It is based on kinetic

Reactions theory of gases.  According to this theory, the reactant molecules are

Chemistry 82

Reprint 2025-26



assumed to be hard spheres and reaction is postulated to occur when
molecules collide with each other.  The number of collisions per
second per unit volume of the reaction mixture is known as
collision frequency (Z). Another factor which affects the rate of
chemical reactions is activation energy (as we have already studied).
For a bimolecular elementary reaction

A + B   ®   Products
rate of reaction can be expressed as

Rate = Z e−Ea /RT (3.23)
AB

where ZAB represents the collision frequency of reactants, A and B
-Ea /RT

and e  represents the fraction of molecules with energies equal to
or greater than Ea. Comparing (3.23) with Arrhenius equation, we can
say that A is related to collision frequency.

Equation (3.23) predicts the value of rate constants fairly
accurately for the reactions that involve atomic species or simple
molecules but for complex molecules significant deviations are
observed.  The reason could be that all collisions do not lead to the
formation of products. The collisions in which molecules collide with
sufficient kinetic energy (called threshold energy*) and proper
orientation, so as to facilitate breaking of bonds between reacting
species and formation of new bonds to form products are called as
effective collisions.

For example, formation of
methanol from bromoethane depends
upon the orientation of reactant
molecules as shown in
Fig. 3.12. The proper orientation of
reactant molecules lead to bond
formation whereas improper
orientation makes them simply
bounce back and no products are
formed.

Fig. 3.12: Diagram showing molecules having proper and
To account for effective collisions, improper  orientation

another factor P, called the probability
or steric factor is introduced. It takes into account the fact that in a
collision, molecules must be properly oriented i.e.,

Rate = PZ e−Ea /RT
AB

Thus, in collision theory activation energy and proper orientation of
the molecules together determine the criteria for an effective collision
and hence the rate of a chemical reaction.

Collision theory also has certain drawbacks as it considers atoms/
molecules to be hard spheres and ignores their structural aspect. You
will study details about this theory and more on other theories in your
higher classes.

Summary
Chemical kinetics is the study of chemical reactions with respect to reaction
rates, effect of various variables, rearrangement of atoms and formation of
intermediates.  The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration
of reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time.  It can
be expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average
rate over a large interval of time.  A number of factors such as temperature,
concentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction.  Mathematical
representation of rate of a reaction is given by rate law.  It has to be determined
experimentally and cannot be predicted.  Order of a reaction with respect to
a reactant is the power of its concentration  which appears in the rate law
equation. The order of a reaction is the sum of all such powers of concentration
of terms for different reactants. Rate constant is the proportionality factor in
the rate law.  Rate constant and order of a reaction can be determined from rate
law or its integrated rate equation.  Molecularity is defined only for an elementary
reaction.  Its values are limited from 1 to 3 whereas order can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or
even a fraction. Molecularity and order of an elementary reaction are same.

Temperature dependence of rate constants is described by Arrhenius equation
(k = Ae–Ea/RT). E  corresponds to the activation energy and is given by the

a
energy difference between activated complex and the reactant molecules, and A
(Arrhenius factor or pre-exponential factor)  corresponds to  the collision frequency.
The equation clearly shows that increase of temperature or lowering of E  will

a
lead to an increase in the rate of reaction and presence of a catalyst lowers the
activation energy by providing an alternate path for the reaction. According to
collision theory, another factor P called steric factor which refers to the orientation
of molecules which collide, is important and contributes to effective collisions,

from the fact that their chemical properties were
transitional between those of s and p-block elements.

as metals which have incomplete d subshell either in

mercury of group 12 have full d  configuration in their
ground state as well as in their common oxidation states
and hence, are not regarded as transition metals.
However, being the end members of the 3d, 4d and 5d
transition series, respectively, their chemistry is studied
along with the chemistry of the transition metals.

the non-transition elements. Hence, transition elements
and their compounds are studied separately. However,
the usual theory of valence as applicable to the non-
transition elements can be applied successfully to the
transition elements also.

Various precious metals such as silver, gold and
platinum and industrially important metals like iron,
copper and titanium belong to the transition metals series.

In this Unit, we shall first deal with the electronic
configuration, occurrence and general characteristics of
transition elements with special emphasis on the trends
in the properties of the first row (3d) transition metals
along with the preparation and properties of some
important compounds. This will be followed by
consideration of certain general aspects such as electronic
configurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity
of the inner transition metals.

THE TRANSITION ELEMENTS (d-BLOCK)

4. 1 Position in the The d–block occupies the large middle section of the periodic table
Periodic Table flanked between s– and p– blocks in the periodic table. The d–orbitals

of the penultimate energy level of atoms receive electrons giving rise to
four rows of the transition metals, i.e., 3d, 4d, 5d and 6d. All these
series of transition elements are shown in Table 4.1.

4.2 Electronic In general the electronic configuration of outer orbitals of these elements
1– 10 1–2

is (n-1)d ns except for Pd where its electronic configuration is 4d105s0.
Configurations The (n–1) stands for the inner d orbitals which may have one to ten
of the d-Block electrons and the outermost ns orbital may have one or two electrons.

Elements However, this generalisation has several exceptions because of very
little energy difference between (n-1)d and ns orbitals. Furthermore,
half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A
consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations
of Cr and Cu in the 3d series. For example, consider the case of Cr,

5 1 4 2
which has 3d 4s  configuration instead of 3d 4s ; the energy gap
between the two sets (3d and 4s) of orbitals is small enough to prevent
electron entering the 3d orbitals. Similarly in case of Cu, the

10 1 9 2
configuration is 3d 4s  and not 3d 4s . The ground state electronic
configurations of the outer orbitals of transition elements are given in
Table 4.1.

The electronic configurations of outer orbitals of Zn, Cd, Hg and Cn
10 2

are represented by the general formula (n-1)d ns . The orbitals in
these elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in
their common oxidation states. Therefore, they are not regarded as
transition elements.

The d orbitals of the transition elements protrude to the periphery of
an atom more than the other orbitals (i.e., s and p), hence, they are more
influenced by the surroundings as well as affect the atoms or molecules

n
surrounding them. In some respects, ions of a given d  configuration
(n = 1 – 9) have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly
filled d orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties
such as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured
ions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands.

The transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic
property and paramagnetic behaviour. All these characteristics have
been discussed in detail later in this Unit.

There are greater similarities in the properties of the transition
elements of a horizontal row in contrast to the non-transition elements.
However, some group similarities also exist. We shall first study the
general characteristics and their trends in the horizontal rows

We will discuss the properties of elements of first transition series
only in the following sections.

Properties of Nearly all the transition elements display typical metallic properties

the Transition such as high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, high thermal and
electrical conductivity and metallic lustre.  With the exceptions of Zn,

Elements Cd, Hg and Mn, they have one or more typical metallic structures at

favourable for strong interatomic interaction. In general, greater the
number of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since
the enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the
standard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy
of atomisation (i.e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their
reactions (see later for electrode potentials).

Another generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 4.2 is that the
metals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of
atomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an
important factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent
metal – metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals.

4.3.2 Variation in In general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive
Atomic and decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the
Ionic Sizes new electron enters a d orbital each time the nuclear charge increases
of by unity. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a d electron is
Transition not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the
Metals nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic

radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a
given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An
interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared
with those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves
in Fig. 4.3 show an increase from the first (3d) to the second (4d) series
of the elements but the radii of the third (5d) series are virtually the
same as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This
phenomenon is associated with the intervention of the 4f orbitals which
must be filled before the 5d series of elements begin. The filling of 4f
before 5d orbital results in a regular decrease in atomic radii called
Lanthanoid contraction which essentially compensates for the expected

93 The d- and f- Block Elements

increase in atomic size with increasing atomic number. The net result
of the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third d series
exhibit similar radii (e.g., Zr 160 pm, Hf 159 pm) and have very similar
physical and chemical properties much more than that expected on
the basis of usual family relationship.

19 The factor responsible for the lanthanoid

18 contraction is somewhat similar to that observed
in an ordinary transition series and is attributed

17 to similar cause, i.e., the imperfect shielding of
16 one electron by another in the same set of orbitals.

However, the shielding of one 4f electron by
15

another is less than that of one d electron by
14 another, and as the nuclear charge increases
13 along the series, there is fairly regular decrease

in the size of the entire 4f  orbitals.

Why do the transition elements exhibit higher enthalpies of Example 4.2
atomisation?

Because of large number of unpaired electrons in their atoms they Solution
have stronger interatomic interaction and hence stronger bonding
between atoms resulting in higher enthalpies of atomisation.

Intext Question
4.2 In the series Sc (Z = 21) to Zn (Z = 30), the enthalpy of atomisation

–1
of zinc is the lowest, i.e., 126 kJ mol . Why?

4.3.3 Ionisation There is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the
Enthalpies transition elements from left to right due to an increase in nuclear

charge which accompanies the filling of the inner d orbitals. Table
4.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first
series of transition elements. These values show that the successive
enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case
of non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along
a series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation
along a period of non-transition elements. The first ionisation enthalpy,
in general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second
and third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, is much
higher along a series.

The irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of
3d series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for
by considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies
of 4s and 3d orbitals. You have learnt that when d-block elements form
ions, ns electrons are lost before (n – 1) d electrons. As we move along
the period in 3d series, we see that nuclear charge increases from
scandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell,
i.e., 3d orbitals. These 3d electrons shield the 4s electrons from the
increasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer
shell electrons can shield one another. Therefore, the atomic radii
decrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly

n
along the 3d series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have d
configurations with no 4s electrons. A general trend of increasing values
of second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge
increases because one d electron does not shield another electron from
the influence of nuclear charge because d-orbitals differ in direction.
However, the trend of steady increase in second and third ionisation
enthalpy breaks for the formation of Mn2+ and Fe3+ respectively. In both
the cases, ions have d5 configuration. Similar breaks occur at
corresponding elements in the later transition series.

The interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic
configuration dn is as follows:

The three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are
attraction of each electron towards nucleus, repulsion between the

95 The d- and f- Block Elements

Reprint 2025-26



electrons and the exchange energy. Exchange energy is responsible for
the stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately
proportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in
the degenerate orbitals. When several electrons occupy a set of
degenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum
possible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds
rule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability
increases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of
exchange energy at d6 configuration. Mn+ has 3d54s1 configuration and
configuration of Cr+ is d5, therefore, ionisation enthalpy of Mn+ is lower
than Cr+. In the same way, Fe2+ has d6 configuration and Mn2+ has 3d5

configuration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of Fe2+ is lower than the Mn2+.
In other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is
lower than that of Mn.

 The lowest common oxidation state of these metals is +2. To
2+

form the M  ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and
second ionisation enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of
atomisation. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy

+
which shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where M  ions

5 10
have the d  and d  configurations respectively. The value for Zn is
correspondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one 4s

10
electron which results in the formation of stable d  configuration.
The trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by
the 4s orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an

5 2+ 10 2+
electron from the d  (Mn ) and d  (Zn ) ions. In general, the third
ionisation enthalpies are quite high. Also the high values for third
ionisation enthalpies of copper, nickel and zinc indicate why it is
difficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements.

Although ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the
relative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and
not amenable to ready generalisation.

4.3.4 Oxidation One of the notable features of a transition elements is the great variety
States of oxidation states these may show in their compounds. Table 4.3 lists

the common oxidation states of the first row transition elements.

The elements which give the greatest number of oxidation states
occur in or near the middle of the series. Manganese, for example,
exhibits all the oxidation states from +2 to +7. The lesser number of
oxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons
to lose or share (Sc, Ti) or too many d electrons (hence fewer orbitals
available in which to share electrons with others) for higher valence
(Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series scandium(II) is virtually unknown
and titanium (IV) is more stable than Ti(III) or Ti(II). At the other end,
the only oxidation state of zinc is +2 (no d electrons are involved). The
maximum oxidation states of reasonable stability correspond in value

IV V +
to the sum of the s and d electrons upto manganese (Ti O2, V O2 ,

V1 2– VII –
Cr O4 , Mn O4 ) followed by a rather abrupt decrease in stability of

II,III
higher oxidation states, so that the typical species to follow are Fe ,

II,III II I,II II
Co , Ni , Cu , Zn .

The variability of oxidation states, a characteristic of transition
elements, arises out of incomplete filling of d orbitals in such a way

II III
that their oxidation states differ from each other by unity, e.g., V , V ,

IV V
V , V . This is in contrast with the variability of oxidation states of non
transition elements where oxidation states normally differ by a unit
of two.

An interesting feature in the variability of oxidation states of the d–
block elements is noticed among the groups (groups 4 through 10).
Although in the p–block the lower oxidation states are favoured by the
heavier members (due to inert pair effect), the opposite is true in the
groups of d-block. For example, in group 6, Mo(VI) and W(VI) are
found to be more stable than Cr(VI). Thus Cr(VI) in the form of dichromate
in acidic medium is a strong oxidising agent, whereas MoO3 and WO3

are not.
Low oxidation states are found when a complex compound has

ligands capable of p-acceptor character in addition to the s-bonding.
For example, in Ni(CO)4 and Fe(CO)5, the oxidation state of nickel and
iron is zero.

Oxidation MnO3F is known, and beyond Mn no metal has a trihalide except FeX3

due to either higher lattice energy as in the case of CoF3, or higher bond
enthalpy terms for the higher covalent compounds, e.g., VF5 and CrF6.

and Eo a few are ‘noble’—that is, they are unaffected by single acids.
Values The metals of the first series with the exception of copper are relatively

more reactive and are oxidised by 1M H+, though the actual rate at

which these metals react with oxidising agents like hydrogen ion (H ) is
sometimes slow. For example, titanium and vanadium, in practice, are
passive to dilute non oxidising acids at room temperature. The o

E  values
for M2+/M (Table 4.2) indicate a decreasing tendency to form divalent
cations across the series. This general trend towards less negative o

4.3.9 Magnetic When a magnetic field is applied to substances, mainly two types of
Properties magnetic behaviour are observed: diamagnetism and paramagnetism.

Diamagnetic substances are repelled by the applied field while the
paramagnetic substances are attracted. Substances which are

101 The d- and f- Block Elements

Reprint 2025-26



attracted very strongly are said to be ferromagnetic. In fact,
ferromagnetism is an extreme form of paramagnetism. Many of the
transition metal ions are paramagnetic.

Paramagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each
such electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular
momentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the
first series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular
momentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance. For
these, the magnetic moment is determined by the number of unpaired
electrons and is calculated by using the ‘spin-only’ formula, i.e.,

  n n  2

where n is the number of unpaired electrons and µ is the magnetic
moment in units of Bohr magneton (BM). A single unpaired electron
has a magnetic moment of 1.73 Bohr magnetons (BM).

The magnetic moment increases with the increasing number of
unpaired electrons. Thus, the observed magnetic moment gives a useful
indication about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom,
molecule or ion. The magnetic moments calculated from the ‘spin-only’
formula and those derived experimentally for some ions of the first row
transition elements are given in Table 4.7. The experimental data are
mainly for hydrated ions in solution or in the solid state.

Ions of light absorbed (Unit 5). This frequency generally lies in the visible

dealt with in detail in Unit 5). The transition metals form a large
number of complex compounds. This is due to the comparatively
smaller sizes of the metal ions, their high ionic charges and the
availability of d orbitals for bond formation.

4.3.12 Catalytic The transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic
Properties activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple

oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in Contact
Process), finely divided iron (in Haber’s Process), and nickel (in Catalytic
Hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface
involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms
of the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise 3d and
4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the
concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening
of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering).
Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states,
they become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(III) catalyses
the reaction between iodide and persulphate ions.

4.3.13 Formation Interstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms
of like H, C or N are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals. They are
Interstitial usually non stoichiometric and are neither typically ionic nor covalent,
Compounds for example, TiC, Mn4N, Fe3H, VH0.56 and TiH1.7, etc. The formulas

quoted do not, of course, correspond to any normal oxidation state of
the metal. Because of the nature of their composition, these compounds
are referred to as interstitial compounds. The principal physical and
chemical characteristics of these compounds are as follows:

(i) They have high melting points, higher than those of pure metals.
(ii) They are very hard, some borides approach diamond in hardness.
(iii) They retain metallic conductivity.
(iv) They are chemically inert.

4.3.14 Alloy An alloy is a blend of metals prepared by mixing the components.
Formation Alloys may be homogeneous solid solutions in which the atoms of one

metal are distributed randomly among the atoms of the other. Such
alloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15
percent of each other. Because of similar radii and other characteristics
of transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The
alloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points. The best
known are ferrous alloys: chromium, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum
and manganese are used for the production of a variety of steels and
stainless steel. Alloys of transition metals with non transition metals
such as brass (copper-zinc) and bronze (copper-tin), are also of
considerable industrial importance.

example.

Solution When a particular oxidation state becomes less stable relative to other
oxidation states, one lower, one higher, it is said to undergo disproportionation.

4 .4 Some 4.4.1 Oxides and Oxoanions of Metals

Important These oxides are generally formed by the reaction of metals with
Compounds of oxygen at high temperatures. All the metals except scandium form

Transition MO oxides which are ionic. The highest oxidation number in the
oxides, coincides with the group number and is attained in Sc2O3 to

Elements Mn2O7. Beyond group 7, no higher oxides of iron above Fe2O3 are
V + IV

known. Besides the oxides, the oxocations stabilise V  as VO2 , V  as
2+ IV 2+

VO  and Ti  as TiO .
As the oxidation number of a metal increases, ionic character

decreases. In the case of Mn, Mn2O7 is a covalent green oil. Even CrO3

and V2O5 have low melting points. In these higher oxides, the acidic
character is predominant.

Thus, Mn2O7 gives HMnO4 and CrO3 gives H2CrO4 and H2Cr2O7.
3–

V2O5 is, however, amphoteric though mainly acidic and it gives VO4  as
+

well as VO2  salts. In vanadium there is gradual change from the basic
V2O3 to less basic V2O4 and to amphoteric V2O5. V2O4 dissolves in acids

2+ 
to give VO salts. Similarly, V2O5 reacts with alkalies as well as acids
to give VO3  and VO  respectively. The well characterised CrO is basic

4 4

but Cr2O3 is amphoteric.

Potassium dichromate K2Cr2O7

Potassium dichromate is a very important chemical used in leather
industry and as an oxidant for preparation of many azo compounds.
Dichromates are generally prepared from chromate, which in turn are
obtained by the fusion of chromite ore (FeCr2O4) with sodium or
potassium carbonate in free access of air. The reaction with sodium
carbonate occurs as follows:

4 FeCr2O4 + 8 Na2CO3 + 7 O2 ® 8 Na2CrO4 + 2 Fe2O3 + 8 CO2

The yellow solution of sodium chromate is filtered and acidified
with sulphuric acid to give a solution from which orange sodium
dichromate, Na2Cr2O7. 2H2O can be crystallised.

2Na2CrO4 + 2 H  ® Na2Cr2O7 + 2 Na  + H2O

Sodium dichromate is more soluble than potassium dichromate.
The latter is therefore, prepared by treating the solution of sodium
dichromate with potassium chloride.

Na2Cr2O7 + 2 KCl ® K2Cr2O7 + 2 NaCl

Orange crystals of potassium dichromate crystallise out. The
chromates and dichromates are interconvertible in aqueous solution
depending upon pH of the solution. The oxidation state of chromium
in chromate and dichromate is the same.

the dichromate ion, Cr2O7

are shown below. The
chromate ion is tetrahedral
whereas the dichromate ion
consists of two tetrahedra

Cr–O–Cr bond angle of 126°.

Sodium and potassium dichromates are strong oxidising agents;
the sodium salt has a greater solubility in water and is extensively
used as an oxidising agent in organic chemistry. Potassium dichromate
is used as a primary standard in volumetric analysis. In acidic solution,
its oxidising action can be represented as follows:

2– + – 3+
Cr2O7  + 14H  + 6e  ® 2Cr  + 7H2O ( o

E  = 1.33V)

Thus, acidified potassium dichromate will oxidise iodides to iodine,
sulphides to sulphur, tin(II) to tin(IV) and iron(II) salts to iron(III). The
half-reactions are noted below:

– – 2+ 4+ –

+ – 2+ 3+ –
3 H2S ® 6H  + 3S + 6e ; 6 Fe  ® 6Fe  + 6 e

The full ionic equation may be obtained by adding the half-reaction for
potassium dichromate to the half-reaction for the reducing agent, for e.g.,

Potassium permanganate KMnO4

Potassium permanganate is prepared by fusion of MnO2 with an alkali
metal hydroxide and an oxidising agent like KNO3. This produces the
dark green K2MnO4 which disproportionates in a neutral or acidic
solution to give permanganate.

Potassium permanganate forms dark purple (almost black) crystals which
are isostructural with those of KClO4. The salt is not very soluble in water
(6.4 g/100 g of water at 293 K), but when heated it decomposes at 513 K.

2KMnO4 ® K2MnO4 + MnO2 + O2

It has two physical properties of considerable interest: its intense colour
and its diamagnetism along with temperature-dependent weak
paramagnetism. These can be explained by the use of molecular orbital
theory which is beyond the present scope.

The manganate and permanganate ions are tetrahedral; the p-
bonding takes place by overlap of p orbitals of oxygen with d orbitals
of manganese. The green manganate is paramagnetic because of one
unpaired electron but the permanganate is diamagnetic due to the
absence of unpaired electron.

Acidified permanganate solution oxidises oxalates to carbon dioxide,
iron(II) to iron(III), nitrites to nitrates and iodides to free iodine.

The full reaction can be written by adding the half-reaction for
KMnO4 to the half-reaction of the reducing agent, balancing wherever
necessary.

manganese dioxide and manganese(II) salt by half-reactions,

We can very well see that the hydrogen ion concentration of the

solution plays an important part in influencing the reaction. Although
many reactions can be understood by consideration of redox potential,
kinetics of the reaction is also an important factor. Permanganate at

+
[H ] = 1 should oxidise water but in practice the reaction is extremely slow
unless either manganese(ll) ions are present or the temperature is raised.

or zinc oxide catalyses the oxidation:

– 2+ +
2MnO4  + 3Mn  + 2H2O ——> 5MnO2 + 4H

Note: Permanganate titrations in presence of hydrochloric acid are
unsatisfactory since hydrochloric acid is oxidised to chlorine.

Uses: Besides its use in analytical chemistry, potassium permanganate is
used as a favourite oxidant in preparative organic chemistry. Its uses for the
bleaching of wool, cotton, silk and other textile fibres and for the decolourisation
of oils are also dependent on its strong oxidising power.

THE INNER TRANSITION ELEMENTS ( f-BLOCK)

The f-block consists of the two series, lanthanoids (the fourteen elements
following lanthanum) and actinoids (the fourteen elements following
actinium). Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is
usually included in any discussion of the lanthanoids for which the
general symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids
includes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series.
The lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members
of ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable
oxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to
examine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a
series of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on
the other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly
owing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these
elements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems
in their study; the two series will be considered separately here.

4 .5 The The names, symbols, electronic configurations of atomic and some

Lanthanoids ionic states and atomic and ionic radii of lanthanum and lanthanoids
(for which the general symbol Ln is used) are given in Table 4.9.

4.5.1 Electronic It may be noted that atoms of these elements have electronic

Configurations configuration with 6s common but with variable occupancy of 4f level
(Table 4.9). However, the electronic configurations of all the tripositive
ions (the most stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids) are of the
form 4 n

f  (n = 1 to 14 with increasing atomic number).

4.5.3 Oxidation In the lanthanoids, La(II) and Ln(III) compounds are predominant
States species. However, occasionally +2 and +4 ions in solution or in solid

compounds are also obtained. This irregularity (as in ionisation
enthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled

IV
or filled f subshell. Thus, the formation of Ce  is favoured by its
noble gas configuration, but it is a strong oxidant reverting to the
common +3 state. The o 4+ 3+

E  value for Ce / Ce  is + 1.74 V which
suggests that it can oxidise water. However, the reaction rate is very
slow and hence Ce(IV) is a good analytical reagent. Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy

2+
also exhibit +4 state but only in oxides, MO2. Eu  is formed by losing

7
the two s electrons and its f  configuration accounts for the formation

2+
of this ion. However, Eu  is a strong reducing agent changing to the

2+ 14 
common +3 state. Similarly Yb  which has f configuration is a

reductant. Tb  has half-filled f-orbitals and is an oxidant. The
behaviour of samarium is very much like europium, exhibiting both
+2 and +3 oxidation states.

4.5.4 General All the lanthanoids are silvery white soft metals and tarnish rapidly in air.
Characteristics The hardness increases with increasing atomic number, samarium being

steel hard. Their melting points range between 1000 to 1200 K but
samarium melts at 1623 K. They have typical metallic structure and are
good conductors of heat and electricity. Density and other properties
change smoothly except for Eu and Yb and occasionally for Sm and Tm.

Many trivalent lanthanoid ions are coloured both in the solid state
and in aqueous solutions. Colour of these ions may be attributed to

3+ 3+ 
the presence of f electrons. Neither La  nor Lu ion shows any colour
but the rest do so. However, absorption bands are narrow, probably
because of the excitation within f level. The lanthanoid ions other

0 3+ 4+ 14 2+ 3+
than the f  type (La  and Ce ) and the f  type (Yb  and Lu ) are
all paramagnetic.

The first ionisation enthalpies of the lanthanoids are around
–1 –1 

600 kJ mol , the second about 1200 kJ mol comparable with those
of calcium. A detailed discussion of the variation of the third ionisation
enthalpies indicates that the exchange enthalpy considerations (as in
3d orbitals of the first transition series), appear to impart a certain
degree of stability to empty, half-filled and completely filled orbitals
f level. This is indicated from the abnormally low value of the third
ionisation enthalpy of lanthanum, gadolinium and lutetium.

In their chemical behaviour, in general, the earlier members of the series
are quite reactive similar to calcium but, with increasing atomic number,
they behave more like aluminium. Values for o

The best single use of the

lanthanoids is for the production of alloy steels for plates and pipes. A
well known alloy is mischmetall which consists of a lanthanoid metal
(~ 95%) and iron (~ 5%) and traces of S, C, Ca and Al. A good deal of
mischmetall is used in Mg-based alloy to produce bullets, shell and
lighter flint. Mixed oxides of lanthanoids are employed as catalysts in
petroleum cracking. Some individual Ln oxides are used as phosphors
in television screens and similar fluorescing surfaces.

The actinoids are radioactive elements and the earlier members have
relatively long half-lives, the latter ones have half-life values ranging from
a day to 3 minutes for lawrencium (Z =103). The latter members could be
prepared only in nanogram quantities. These facts render their study
more difficult.

4.6.1 Electronic 2
All the actinoids are believed to have the electronic configuration of 7s

Configurations and variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons
are formally added to 5f, though not in thorium (Z = 90) but from Pa
onwards the 5f orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in
the electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids

0 7 14 
are related to the stabilities of the f , f  and f occupancies of the 5f

7 2 
orbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and Cm are [Rn] 5f 7s and

 7 1 2
[Rn] 5f 6d 7s . Although the 5f orbitals resemble the 4f orbitals in their
angular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as 4f orbitals
and hence 5f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent.

4.6.2 Ionic Sizes The general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well.
3+

There is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M  ions across the
series. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction (like lanthanoid
contraction). The contraction is, however, greater from element to element
in this series resulting from poor shielding by 5f electrons.

4.6.3 Oxidation There is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to
States the fact that the 5f, 6d and 7s levels are of comparable energies. The

known oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 4.11.
The actinoids show in general +3 oxidation state. The elements, in the

first half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example,
the maximum oxidation state increases from +4 in Th to +5, +6 and +7
respectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements (Table
4.11). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds
in +3 state than in the +4 state. However, +3 and +4 ions tend to hydrolyse.
Because the distribution of oxidation states among the actinoids is so
uneven and so different for the former and later elements, it is unsatisfactory
to review their chemistry in terms of oxidation states.

The actinoids are highly reactive metals, especially when finely divided.
The action of boiling water on them, for example, gives a mixture of oxide
and hydride and combination with most non metals takes place at
moderate temperatures. Hydrochloric acid attacks all metals but most are
slightly affected by nitric acid owing to the formation of protective oxide
layers; alkalies have no action.

The magnetic properties of the actinoids are more complex than those
of the lanthanoids. Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility
of the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5 f electrons is roughly
parallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have
higher values.

It is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation
enthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are
lower than for the early lanthanoids. This is quite reasonable since it is to
be expected that when 5f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will
penetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5f electrons, will therefore,
be more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the 4f electrons
of the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less
firmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids.

A comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to
different characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar
to that of the lanthanoids is not evident until the second half of the
actinoid series. However, even the early actinoids resemble the lanthanoids
in showing close similarities with each other and in gradual variation in
properties which do not entail change in oxidation state. The lanthanoid
and actinoid contractions, have extended effects on the sizes, and
therefore, the properties of the elements succeeding them in their
respective periods. The lanthanoid contraction is more important because
the chemistry of elements succeeding the actinoids are much less known
at the present time.

to exhibit +4 oxidation state.

4.7 Some Iron and steels are the most important construction materials. Their

Applications production is based on the reduction of iron oxides, the removal of
impurities and the addition of carbon and alloying metals such as Cr, Mn

of d- and and Ni. Some compounds are manufactured for special purposes such as
f-Block TiO for the pigment industry and MnO2 for use in dry battery cells. The

Elements battery industry also requires Zn and Ni/Cd. The elements of Group 11
are still worthy of being called the coinage metals, although Ag and Au

113 The d- and f- Block Elements

are restricted to collection items and the contemporary UK ‘copper’ coins
are copper-coated steel. The ‘silver’ UK coins are a Cu/Ni alloy. Many of
the metals and/or their compounds are essential catalysts in the chemical
industry. V2O5 catalyses the oxidation of SO2 in the manufacture of
sulphuric acid. TiCl4 with A1(CH3)3 forms the basis of the Ziegler catalysts
used to manufacture polyethylene (polythene). Iron catalysts are used in
the Haber process for the production of ammonia from N2/H2 mixtures.
Nickel catalysts enable the hydrogenation of fats to proceed. In the Wacker
process the oxidation of ethyne to ethanal is catalysed by PdCl2. Nickel
complexes are useful in the polymerisation of alkynes and other organic
compounds such as benzene. The photographic industry relies on the
special light-sensitive properties of AgBr.

Summary
The d-block consisting of Groups 3-12 occupies the large middle section of the periodic
table. In these elements the inner d orbitals are progressively filled. The f-block is placed
outside at the bottom of the periodic table and in the elements of this block, 4f and
5f orbitals are progressively filled.

Corresponding to the filling of 3d, 4d and 5d orbitals, three series of transition
elements are well recognised. All the transition elements exhibit typical metallic properties
such as –high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, thermal and electrical conductivity
and metallic character. Their melting and boiling points are high which are attributed
to the involvement of (n –1) d electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding. In
many of these properties, the maxima occur at about the middle of each series which
indicates that one unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly a favourable configuration
for strong interatomic interaction.

Successive ionisation enthalpies do not increase as steeply as in the main group
elements with increasing atomic number. Hence, the loss of variable number of electrons
from (n –1) d orbitals is not energetically unfavourable. The involvement of (n–1) d electrons
in the behaviour of transition elements impart certain distinct characteristics to these
elements. Thus, in addition to variable oxidation states, they exhibit paramagnetic
behaviour, catalytic properties and tendency for the formation of coloured ions, interstitial
compounds and complexes.

The transition elements vary widely in their chemical behaviour. Many of them are
sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are ‘noble’. Of the
first series, with the exception of copper, all the metals are relatively reactive.

The transition metals react with a number of non-metals like oxygen, nitrogen,
sulphur and halogens to form binary compounds. The first series transition metal oxides
are generally formed from the reaction of metals with oxygen at high temperatures. These
oxides dissolve in acids and bases to form oxometallic salts. Potassium dichromate and
potassium permanganate are common examples. Potassium dichromate is prepared from
the chromite ore by fusion with alkali in presence of air and acidifying the extract.
Pyrolusite ore (MnO2) is used for the preparation of potassium permanganate. Both the
dichromate and the permanganate ions are strong oxidising agents.

The two series of inner transition elements, lanthanoids and actinoids constitute
the f-block of the periodic table. With the successive filling of the inner orbitals, 4f, there
is a gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic sizes of these metals along the series
(lanthanoid contraction). This has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the
elements succeeding them. Lanthanum and all the lanthanoids are rather soft white
metals. They react easily with water to give solutions giving +3 ions. The principal
oxidation state is +3, although +4 and +2 oxidation states are also exhibited by some

Chemistry 114

occasionally. The chemistry of the actinoids is more complex in view of their ability to
exist in different oxidation states. Furthermore, many of the actinoid elements are radioactive
which make the study of these elements rather difficult.

There are many useful applications of the d- and f-block elements and their
compounds, notable among them being in varieties of steels, catalysts, complexes,
organic syntheses, etc.

his ideas about the structures of coordination compounds. He prepared

Theory of and characterised a large number of coordination compounds and
Coordination studied their physical and chemical behaviour by simple experimental

Compounds techniques. Werner proposed the concept of a primary valence and
a secondary valence for a metal ion. Binary compounds such as
CrCl3, CoCl2 or PdCl2 have primary valence of 3, 2 and 2 respectively.
In a series of compounds of cobalt(III) chloride with ammonia, it was
found that some of the chloride ions could be precipitated as AgCl on
adding excess silver nitrate solution in cold but some remained in
solution.

These observations, together with the results of conductivity
measurements in solution can be explained if (i) six groups in all,
either chloride ions or ammonia molecules or both, remain bonded to
the cobalt ion during the reaction and (ii) the compounds are formulated
as shown in Table 5.1, where the atoms within the square brackets
form a single entity which does not dissociate under the reaction
conditions. Werner proposed the term secondary valence for the
number of groups bound directly to the metal ion; in each of these
examples the secondary valences are six.

Note that the last two compounds in Table 5.1 have identical empirical
formula, CoCl3.4NH3, but distinct properties. Such compounds are
termed as isomers. Werner in 1898, propounded his theory of
coordination compounds. The main postulates are:

1. In coordination compounds metals show two types of linkages
(valences)-primary and secondary.

2. The primary valences are normally ionisable and are satisfied by
negative ions.

3. The secondary valences are non ionisable. These are satisfied by
neutral molecules or negative ions. The secondary valence is equal to
the coordination number and is fixed for a metal.

4. The ions/groups bound by the secondary linkages to the metal have
characteristic spatial arrangements corresponding to different
coordination numbers.
In modern formulations, such spatial arrangements are called

coordination polyhedra. The species within the square bracket are
coordination entities or complexes and the ions outside the square
bracket are called counter ions.

He further postulated that octahedral, tetrahedral and square planar
geometrical shapes are more common in coordination compounds of

3+ 2+ +
transition metals. Thus, [Co(NH3)6] , [CoCl(NH3)5]  and [CoCl2(NH3)4]

are octahedral entities, while [Ni(CO)4] and [PtCl4]  are tetrahedral and

Difference between a double salt and a complex

Both double salts as well as complexes are formed by the combination
of two or more stable compounds in stoichiometric ratio. However, they
differ in the fact that double salts such as carnallite, KCl.MgCl2.6H2O,
Mohr’s salt, FeSO4.(NH4)2SO4.6H2O, potash alum, KAl(SO4)2.12H2O, etc.

Werner was born on December 12, 1866, in Mülhouse,
a small community in the French province of Alsace.
His study of chemistry began in Karlsruhe (Germany)
and continued in Zurich (Switzerland), where in his
doctoral thesis in 1890, he explained the difference in
properties of certain nitrogen containing organic

( 1866-1919) substances on the basis of isomerism. He extended vant
Hoff’s theory of tetrahedral carbon atom and modified

it for nitrogen. Werner showed optical and electrical differences between
complex compounds based on physical measurements. In fact, Werner was
the first to discover optical activity in certain coordination compounds.

He, at the age of 29 years became a full professor at Technische
Hochschule in Zurich in 1895. Alfred Werner was a chemist and educationist.
His accomplishments included the development of the theory of coordination
compounds. This theory, in which Werner proposed revolutionary ideas about
how atoms and molecules are linked together, was formulated in a span of
only three years, from 1890 to 1893. The remainder of his career was spent
gathering the experimental support required to validate his new ideas. Werner
became the first Swiss chemist to win the Nobel Prize in 1913 for his work
on the linkage of atoms and the coordination theory.

5.2 Definitions of ( a ) Coordination entity

Some A coordination entity constitutes a central metal atom or ion bonded
to a fixed number of ions or molecules. For example, [CoCl3(NH3)3]

Important is a coordination entity in which the cobalt ion is surrounded by
Terms three ammonia molecules and three chloride ions. Other examples

4– 3+

Pertaining to are [Ni(CO)4], [PtCl2(NH3)2], [Fe(CN)6] , [Co(NH3)6] .

Coordination (b) Central atom/ion

In a coordination entity, the atom/ion to which a fixed number
Compounds of ions/groups are bound in a definite geometrical arrangement

around it, is called the central atom or ion. For example, the
central atom/ion in the coordination entities: [NiCl2(H2O)4],

2+ 3– 2+ 3+ 3+
[CoCl(NH3)5] and [Fe(CN)6]  are Ni , Co  and Fe , respectively.
These central atoms/ions are also referred to as Lewis acids.

( c ) Ligands

The ions or molecules bound to the central atom/ion in the
coordination entity are called ligands. These may be simple ions

–
such as Cl , small molecules such as H2O or NH3, larger molecules
such as H2NCH2CH2NH2 or N(CH2CH2NH2)3 or even macromolecules,
such as proteins.

When a ligand is bound to a metal ion through a single donor
–

atom, as with Cl , H2O or NH3, the ligand is said to be unidentate.
When a ligand can bind through two donor atoms as in

2–
H2NCH2CH2NH2 (ethane-1,2-diamine) or C2O4  (oxalate), the
ligand is said to be didentate and when several donor atoms are
present in a single ligand as in N(CH2CH2NH2)3, the ligand is said
to be polydentate 4–

. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion (EDTA ) is
an important hexadentate ligand. It can bind through two
nitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion.
When a di- or polydentate ligand uses its two or more donor

atoms simultaneously to bind a single metal ion, it is said to be a
chelate ligand. The number of such ligating groups is called the
denticity of the ligand. Such complexes, called chelate complexes
tend to be more stable than similar complexes containing unidentate
ligands. Ligand which has two different donor atoms and either of

the two ligetes in the complex is called ambidentate
ligand –

. Examples of such ligands are the NO2  and
– –

SCN  ions. NO2  ion can coordinate either through
nitrogen or through oxygen to a central metal
atom/ion.

–
Similarly, SCN  ion can coordinate through the
sulphur or nitrogen atom.

( d ) Coordination number

The coordination number (CN) of a metal ion in a complex can be
defined as the number of ligand donor atoms to which the metal is

2–
directly bonded. For example, in the complex ions, [PtCl6]  and

2+
[Ni(NH3)4] , the coordination number of Pt and Ni are 6 and 4

3–
respectively. Similarly, in the complex ions, [Fe(C2O4)3]  and

3+
[Co(en)3] , the coordination number of both, Fe and Co, is 6 because

2–
C2O4  and en (ethane-1,2-diamine) are didentate ligands.

It is important to note here that coordination number of the central
atom/ion is determined only by the number of sigma bonds formed by
the ligand with the central atom/ion. Pi bonds, if formed between the
ligand and the central atom/ion, are not counted for this purpose.

(e) Coordination sphere

The central atom/ion and the ligands attached to it are enclosed in
square bracket and is collectively termed as the coordination
sphere. The ionisable groups are written outside the bracket and
are called counter ions. For example, in the complex K4[Fe(CN)6],

4– +
the coordination sphere is [Fe(CN)6]  and the counter ion is K .

( f ) Coordination polyhedron

The spatial arrangement of the ligand atoms which are directly
attached to the central atom/ion defines a coordination
polyhedron about the central atom. The most common
coordination polyhedra are octahedral, square planar and

3+
tetrahedral. For example, [Co(NH3)6]  is octahedral, [Ni(CO)4] is

2–
tetrahedral and [PtCl4]  is square planar. Fig. 5.1 shows the
shapes of different coordination polyhedra.

Fig. 5.1: Shapes of different coordination polyhedra. M
represents the central atom/ion and L, a unidentate
ligand.

(g) Oxidation number of central atom

The oxidation number of the central atom in a complex is defined
as the charge it would carry if all the ligands are removed along
with the electron pairs that are shared with the central atom. The
oxidation number is represented by a Roman numeral in parenthesis
following the name of the coordination entity. For example, oxidation

3–
number of copper in [Cu(CN)4]  is +1 and it is written as Cu(I).

( h ) Homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes

Complexes in which a metal is bound to only one kind of donor
3+

groups, e.g., [Co(NH3)6] , are known as homoleptic. Complexes in
which a metal is bound to more than one kind of donor groups,

+
e.g., [Co(NH3)4Cl2] , are known as heteroleptic.

5 .3 Nomenclature Nomenclature is important in Coordination Chemistry because of the

o f need to have an unambiguous method of describing formulas and
writing systematic names, particularly when dealing with isomers. The

Coordination formulas and names adopted for coordination entities are based on the
Compounds recommendations of the International Union of Pure and Applied

Chemistry (IUPAC).

5.3.1 Formulas of The formula of a compound is a shorthand tool used to provide basic
Mononuclear information about the constitution of the compound in a concise and
Coordination convenient manner. Mononuclear coordination entities contain a single
Entities central metal atom. The following rules are applied while writing the formulas:

(i) The central atom is listed first.
(ii) The ligands are then listed in alphabetical order. The placement of

a ligand in the list does not depend on its charge.
(iii) Polydentate ligands are also listed alphabetically. In case of

abbreviated ligand, the first letter of the abbreviation is used to
determine the position of the ligand in the alphabetical order.

(iv) The formula for the entire coordination entity, whether charged or
not, is enclosed in square brackets. When ligands are polyatomic,
their formulas are enclosed in parentheses. Ligand abbreviations
are also enclosed in parentheses.

(v) There should be no space between the ligands and the metal
within a coordination sphere.

irrespective of charge. (vii) The charge of the cation(s) is balanced by the charge of the anion(s).

5.3.2 Naming of The names of coordination compounds are derived by following the
Mononuclear principles of additive nomenclature. Thus, the groups that surround the
Coordination central atom must be identified in the name. They are listed as prefixes
Compounds to the name of the central atom along with any appropriate multipliers.

The following rules are used when naming coordination compounds:
(i) The cation is named first in both positively and negatively charged

coordination entities.
(ii) The ligands are named in an alphabetical order before the name of the

central atom/ion. (This procedure is reversed from writing formula).
(iii) Names of the anionic ligands end in –o, those of neutral and cationic

ligands are the same except aqua for H2O, ammine for NH3, carbonyl
for CO and nitrosyl for NO. While writing the formula of coordination
entity, these are enclosed in brackets ( ).

(iv) Prefixes mono, di, tri, etc., are used to indicate the number of the
individual ligands in the coordination entity. When the names of
the ligands include a numerical prefix, then the terms, bis, tris,
tetrakis are used, the ligand to which they refer being placed in
parentheses. For example, [NiCl2(PPh3)2] is named as
dichloridobis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(II).

(v) Oxidation state of the metal in cation, anion or neutral coordination
entity is indicated by Roman numeral in parenthesis.

(vi) If the complex ion is a cation, the metal is named same as the
element. For example, Co in a complex cation is called cobalt and

IUPAC draft Pt is called platinum. If the complex ion is an anion, the name of

(vii) The neutral complex molecule is named similar to that of the
complex cation.

The following examples illustrate the nomenclature for coordination
compounds.

1. [Cr(NH3)3(H2O)3]Cl3 is named as:
triamminetriaquachromium(III) chloride
Explanation: The complex ion is inside the square bracket, which is
a cation. The amine ligands are named before the aqua ligands
according to alphabetical order. Since there are three chloride ions in
the compound, the charge on the complex ion must be +3 (since the
compound is electrically neutral). From the charge on the complex
ion and the charge on the ligands, we can calculate the oxidation
number of the metal. In this example, all the ligands are neutral
molecules. Therefore, the oxidation number of chromium must be
the same as the charge of the complex  ion, +3.

2. [Co(H2NCH2CH2NH2)3]2(SO4)3 is named as:
tris(ethane-1,2–diamine)cobalt(III) sulphate

charge on each complex cation must be +3. Further, ethane-1,2–

5 .4 Isomerism in Isomers are two or more compounds that have the same chemical

Coordination formula but a different arrangement of atoms. Because of the different
arrangement of atoms, they differ in one or more physical or chemical

Compounds properties. Two principal types of isomerism are known among
coordination compounds. Each of which can be further subdivided.

(a) Stereoisomerism

(i) Geometrical isomerism (ii) Optical isomerism

(b) Structural isomerism

(i) Linkage isomerism (ii) Coordination isomerism
(iii) Ionisation isomerism (iv) Solvate isomerism
Stereoisomers have the same chemical formula and chemical

bonds but they have different spatial arrangement. Structural isomers
have different bonds. A detailed account of these isomers are
given below.

5.4.1 Geometric Isomerism This type of isomerism arises in heteroleptic
complexes due to different possible geometric
arrangements of the ligands. Important examples
of this behaviour are found with coordination
numbers 4 and 6. In a square planar complex of
formula [MX2L2] (X and L are unidentate), the
two ligands X may be arranged adjacent to each

This type of isomerism also
arises when didentate ligands
L – L [e.g., NH2 CH2 CH2 NH2 (en)]
are present in complexes of formula
[MX2(L – L)2] (Fig. 5.4).

Another type of geometrical
isomerism occurs in octahedral

having two different types of unidentate ligands coordinated with
the central metal ion ?

Tetrahedral complexes do not show geometrical isomerism because Solution
the relative positions of the unidentate ligands attached to the central
metal atom are the same with respect to each other.

5.4.2 Optical Isomerism Optical isomers are mirror images that
cannot be superimposed on one
another. These are called as
enantiomers. The molecules or ions
that cannot be superimposed are
called chiral. The two forms are called
dextro (d) and laevo (l) depending
upon the direction they rotate the
plane of polarised light in a
polarimeter (d rotates to the right, l to
the left). Optical isomerism is common
in octahedral complexes involving

containing the thiocyanate ligand, NCS , which may bind through the
nitrogen to give M–NCS or through sulphur to give M–SCN. Jørgensen
discovered such behaviour in the complex [Co(NH3)5(NO2)]Cl2, which is
obtained as the red form, in which the nitrite ligand is bound through
oxygen (–ONO), and as the yellow form, in which the nitrite ligand is
bound through nitrogen (–NO2).

5.4.4 Coordination This type of isomerism arises from the interchange of ligands between
Isomerism cationic and anionic entities of different metal ions present in a complex.

An example is provided by [Co(NH3)6][Cr(CN)6], in which the NH3 ligands
3+ – 3+

are bound to Co  and the CN  ligands to Cr . In its coordination

isomer [Cr(NH3)6][Co(CN)6], the NH3 ligands are bound to Cr  and the

CN  ligands to Co .

5.4.5 Ionisation This form of isomerism arises when the counter ion in a complex salt
Isomerism is itself a potential ligand and can displace a ligand which can then

become the counter ion. An example is provided by the ionisation
isomers [Co(NH3)5(SO4)]Br and [Co(NH3)5Br]SO4.

5 .5 Bonding in Werner was the first to describe the bonding features in coordination

Coordination compounds. But his theory could not answer basic questions like:

Compounds (i) Why only certain elements possess the remarkable property of
forming coordination compounds?

(ii) Why the bonds in coordination compounds have directional
properties?

(iii) Why coordination compounds have characteristic magnetic and
optical properties?

Many approaches have been put forth to explain the nature of
bonding in coordination compounds viz. Valence Bond Theory (VBT),
Crystal Field Theory (CFT), Ligand Field Theory (LFT) and Molecular
Orbital Theory (MOT). We shall focus our attention on elementary
treatment of the application of VBT and CFT to coordination compounds.

5.5.1 Valence According to this theory, the metal atom or ion under the influence of
Bond ligands can use its (n-1)d, ns, np or ns, np, nd orbitals for hybridisation
Theory to yield a set of equivalent orbitals of definite geometry such as octahedral,

tetrahedral, square planar and so on (Table 5.2). These hybridised orbitals
are allowed to overlap with ligand orbitals that can donate electron pairs
for bonding. This is illustrated by the following examples.

for the atomic orbitals involved.

Coordination structures adopted by metal complexes.

metals of the first transition series reveals some complications. For
3+ 1 3+

metal ions with upto three electrons in the d orbitals, like Ti  (d ); V
2 3+ 3

(d ); Cr  (d ); two vacant d orbitals are available for octahedral
hybridisation with 4s and 4p orbitals. The magnetic behaviour of these
free ions and their coordination entities is similar. When more than
three 3d electrons are present, the required pair of 3d orbitals for
octahedral hybridisation is not directly available (as a consequence of

4 2+ 3+ 5 2+ 3+ 6 2+ 3+
Hund’s rule). Thus, for d  (Cr , Mn ), d  (Mn , Fe ), d  (Fe , Co )
cases, a vacant pair of d orbitals results only by pairing of 3d electrons
which leaves two, one and zero unpaired electrons, respectively.

The magnetic data agree with maximum spin pairing in many cases,

will be either tetrahedral (sp  hybridisation) or square planar (dsp
hybridisation). But the fact that the magnetic moment of the complex
ion is 5.9 BM, it should be tetrahedral in shape rather than square
planar because of the presence of five unpaired electrons in the d orbitals.

5.5.3 Limitations While the VB theory, to a larger extent, explains the formation, structures
of Valence and magnetic behaviour of coordination compounds, it suffers from
Bond the following shortcomings:
Theory (i) It involves a number of assumptions.

(ii) It does not give quantitative interpretation of magnetic data.
(iii) It does not explain the colour exhibited by coordination compounds.
(iv) It does not give a quantitative interpretation of the thermodynamic

or kinetic stabilities of coordination compounds.
(v) It does not make exact predictions regarding the tetrahedral and

square planar structures of 4-coordinate complexes.
(vi) It does not distinguish between weak and strong ligands.

5.5.4 Crystal The crystal field theory (CFT) is an electrostatic model which considers
Field the metal-ligand bond to be ionic arising purely from electrostatic
Theory interactions between the metal ion and the ligand. Ligands are treated

as point charges in case of anions or point dipoles in case of neutral
molecules. The five d orbitals in an isolated gaseous metal atom/ion
have same energy, i.e., they are degenerate. This degeneracy is
maintained if a spherically symmetrical field of negative charges
surrounds the metal atom/ion. However, when this negative field is
due to ligands (either anions or the negative ends of dipolar molecules
like NH3 and H2O) in a complex, it becomes asymmetrical and the
degeneracy of the d orbitals is lifted. It results in splitting of the d
orbitals. The pattern of splitting depends upon the nature of the crystal
field. Let us explain this splitting in different crystal fields.

( a ) Crystal field splitting in octahedral coordination entities

In an octahedral coordination entity with six ligands surrounding
the metal atom/ion, there will be repulsion between the electrons in
metal d orbitals and the electrons (or negative charges) of the ligands.
Such a repulsion is more when the metal d orbital is directed towards

the ligand than when it is away from the ligand. Thus, the d
x2 y2

andd  rbi als whi
z2 o t  ch point towards the axes along the direction of

the ligand will experience more repulsion and will be raised in
energy; and the dxy, dyz and dxz orbitals which are directed between
the axes will be lowered in energy relative to the average energy in
the spherical crystal field. Thus, the degeneracy of the d orbitals
has been removed due to ligand electron-metal electron repulsions
in the octahedral complex to yield three orbitals of lower energy, t2g

set and two orbitals of higher energy, eg set. This splitting of the

131 Coordination Compounds

Reprint 2025-26



degenerate levels due to the
presence of ligands in a
definite geometry is termed as
crystal field splitting and
the energy separation is
denoted by Do (the subscript
o is for octahedral) (Fig.5.8).
Thus, the energy of the two eg

orbitals will increase by (3/5)
Do and that of the three t2g will
decrease by (2/5)Do.

The crystal field splitting,
Do, depends upon the field
produced by the ligand and
charge on the metal ion. Some
ligands are able to produce
strong fields in which case, the
splitting will be large whereas
others produce weak fields

Fig.5.8:  d orbital splitting in an octahedral crystal field
and consequently result in
small splitting of d orbitals.

In general, ligands can be arranged in a series in the order of increasing
field strength as given below:

– – – – 2– – – 2– –
I  < Br  < SCN  < Cl  < S  < F  < OH  < C2O4  < H2O < NCS

4– –
< edta  < NH3 < en < CN  < CO

Such a series is termed as spectrochemical series. It is an
experimentally determined series based on the absorption of light
by complexes with different ligands. Let us assign electrons in the d
orbitals of metal ion in octahedral coordination entities. Obviously,
the single d electron occupies one of the lower energy t2g orbitals. In

2 3
d  and d  coordination entities, the d electrons occupy the t2g orbitals

4
singly in accordance with the Hund’s rule. For d  ions, two possible
patterns of electron distribution arise: (i) the fourth electron could
either enter the t2g level and pair with an existing electron, or (ii) it
could avoid paying the price of the pairing energy by occupying the
eg level. Which of these possibilities occurs, depends on the relative
magnitude of the crystal field splitting, Do and the pairing energy, P
(P represents the energy required for electron pairing in a single
orbital). The two options are:

(i) If Do < P, the fourth electron enters one of the eg orbitals giving the

configuration t
3 1
2geg . Ligands for which Do < P are known as weak

field ligands and form high spin complexes.

(ii) If Do > P, it becomes more energetically favourable for the fourth
4 0

electron to occupy a t2g orbital with configuration t2g eg . Ligands
which produce this effect are known as strong field ligands and
form low spin complexes.

4 7
Calculations show that d  to d  coordination entities are more

stable for strong field as compared to weak field cases.

Reprint 2025-26



( b ) Crystal field splitting in tetrahedral coordination entities

In tetrahedral coordination entity formation,
the d orbital splitting (Fig. 5.9) is inverted
and is smaller as compared to the octahedral
field splitting. For the same metal, the same
ligands and metal-ligand distances, it can
be shown that Dt = (4/9) D0. Consequently,
the orbital splitting energies are not
sufficiently large for forcing pairing and,
therefore, low spin configurations are rarely
observed. The ‘g’ subscript is used for the
octahedral and square planar complexes
which have centre of symmetry. Since

Fig.5.9: d orbital splitting in a tetrahedral
crystal field. tetrahedral complexes lack symmetry, ‘g’

subscript is not used with energy levels.

5.5.5 Colour in In the previous Unit, we learnt that one of the most distinctive
Coordination properties of transition metal complexes is their wide range of colours.
Compounds This means that some of the visible spectrum is being removed from

white light as it passes through the sample, so the light that emerges
is no longer white. The colour of the complex is complementary to
that which is absorbed. The complementary colour is the colour

The colour in the coordination compounds can be readily explained
in terms of the crystal field theory. Consider, for example, the complex
[Ti(H2O)6]

3+, which is violet in colour. This is an octahedral complex
3+ 1

where the single electron (Ti  is a 3d  system) in the metal d orbital is
in the t2g level in the ground state of the complex. The next higher state
available for the electron is the empty eg level. If light corresponding to
the energy of blue-green region is absorbed by the complex, it would

1 0 0 1
excite the electron from t2g level to the eg level (t2g eg  ® t2g eg ).
Consequently, the complex appears violet in colour (Fig. 5.10). The
crystal field theory attributes the colour of the coordination compounds
to d-d transition of the electron.

5.7 Importance The coordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds

and are widely present in the mineral, plant and animal worlds and are
known to play many important functions in the area of analytical

Applications chemistry, metallurgy, biological systems, industry and medicine. These
o f are described below:

Coordination • Coordination compounds find use in many qualitative and

Compounds quantitative chemical analysis. The familiar colour reactions given
by metal ions with a number of ligands (especially chelating ligands),
as a result of formation of coordination entities, form the basis for
their detection and estimation by classical and instrumental methods
of analysis. Examples of such reagents include EDTA, DMG
(dimethylglyoxime), a–nitroso–b–naphthol, cupron, etc.

• Hardness of water is estimated by simple titration with Na2EDTA.
2+ 2+

The Ca  and Mg  ions form stable complexes with EDTA. The
selective estimation of these ions can be done due to difference in
the stability constants of calcium and magnesium complexes.

• Some important extraction processes of metals, like those of silver and
gold, make use of complex formation. Gold, for example, combines with
cyanide in the presence of oxygen and water to form the coordination

–
entity [Au(CN)2]  in aqueous solution. Gold can be separated in metallic
form from this solution by the addition of zinc.

• Similarly, purification of metals can be achieved through formation
and subsequent decomposition of their coordination compounds.

For example, impure nickel is converted to [Ni(CO)4], which is
decomposed to yield pure nickel.

• Coordination compounds are of great importance in biological
systems. The pigment responsible for photosynthesis, chlorophyll,
is a coordination compound of magnesium. Haemoglobin, the red
pigment of blood which acts as oxygen carrier is a coordination
compound of iron. Vitamin B12, cyanocobalamine, the anti–
pernicious anaemia factor, is a coordination compound of cobalt.
Among the other compounds of biological importance with
coordinated metal ions are the enzymes like, carboxypeptidase A
and carbonic anhydrase (catalysts of biological systems).

• Coordination compounds are used as catalysts for many industrial
processes. Examples include rhodium complex, [(Ph3P)3RhCl], a
Wilkinson catalyst, is used for the hydrogenation of alkenes.

• Articles can be electroplated with silver and gold much more
–

smoothly and evenly from solutions of the complexes, [Ag(CN)2]

and [Au(CN)2]  than from a solution of simple metal ions.
• In black and white photography, the developed film is fixed by

washing with hypo solution which dissolves the undecomposed
3–

AgBr to form a complex ion, [Ag(S2O3)2] .
• There is growing interest in the use of chelate therapy in medicinal

chemistry. An example is the treatment of problems caused by the
presence of metals in toxic proportions in plant/animal systems.
Thus, excess of copper and iron are removed by the chelating ligands
D–penicillamine and desferrioxime B via the formation of coordination
compounds. EDTA is used in the treatment of lead poisoning. Some
coordination compounds of platinum effectively inhibit the growth
of tumours. Examples are: cis–platin and related compounds.

Summary
The chemistry of coordination compounds is an important and challenging
area of modern inorganic chemistry. During the last fifty years, advances in this
area, have provided development of new concepts and models of bonding and
molecular structure, novel breakthroughs in chemical industry and vital
insights into the functioning of critical components of biological systems.

The first systematic attempt at explaining the formation, reactions, structure
and bonding of a coordination compound was made by A. Werner. His theory
postulated the use of two types of linkages (primary and secondary) by a
metal atom/ion in a coordination compound. In the modern language of chemistry
these linkages are recognised as the ionisable (ionic) and non-ionisable (covalent)
bonds, respectively. Using the property of isomerism, Werner predicted the
geometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities.

The Valence Bond Theory (VBT) explains with reasonable success, the
formation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds.
It, however, fails to provide a quantitative interpretation of magnetic behaviour
and has nothing to say about the optical properties of these compounds.

The Crystal Field Theory (CFT) to coordination compounds is based on
the effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges),

on the degeneracy of d orbital energies of the central metal atom/ion. The
splitting of the d orbitals provides different electronic arrangements in strong
and weak crystal fields. The treatment provides for quantitative estimations of
orbital separation energies, magnetic moments and spectral and stability
parameters. However, the assumption that ligands consititute point charges
creates many theoretical difficulties.

The metal–carbon bond in metal carbonyls possesses both s and p character.
The ligand to metal is s bond and metal to ligand is p bond. This unique synergic
bonding provides stability to metal carbonyls.

Coordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds provide
critical insights into the functioning and structures of vital components of
biological systems. Coordination compounds also find extensive applications in
metallurgical processes, analytical and medicinal chemistry.
