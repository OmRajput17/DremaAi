Read aloud the poem. Ask children to recite and enact it. Children can look
at the pictures and tell what all they see and discuss the things
which are above, below, on, under, and so on with the class.

Let us Play - Find the Things
Children can divide themselves into 2 teams. One team will
hide a few things like white chalk, red ball and other items
and ask the other team to find them. Children can give
verbal instructions to find the things using positional words
like inside/outside, far/near, above/below, etc.
For example:
• Look for a white thing which is hidden
near the board and under the table.
Look for a red thing which is outside
the classroom and under the tree.
