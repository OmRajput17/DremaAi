Why do we need political parties?
to be very critical of political parties.
They tend to blame parties for all
that is wrong with our democracy
and our political life. Parties have
become identified with social and
political divisions.
Therefore, it is natural to ask – do
we need political parties at all? About
hundred years ago, there were few
countries of the world that had
any political party. Now there are
few that do not have parties. Why
did political parties become so
omnipresent in democracies all over
the world? Let us first answer what
political parties are and what they
do, before we say why we need them.

So, you agree
with me. Parties
are partial,
partisan and lead
to partitions.
Parties do
nothing but
divide people.
That is their real
function!

Meaning

(1)

A political party is a group of
people who come together to contest
elections and hold power in the
government. They agree on some
policies and programmes for the
society with a view to promote the
collective good. Since there can be
different views on what is good for

(3)

(2)

Election Commission has officially banned wall
writing by parties during election times. Most
political parties argue that was the cheapest way
for their campaign. These election times used to
create amazing graffiti on the walls. Here are some
examples from Tamil Nadu.

Political parties are easily one of
the most visible institutions in a
democracy. For most ordinary
citizens, democracy is equal to
political parties. If you travel to
remote parts of our country and
speak to the less educated citizens,
you could come across people who
may not know anything about our
Constitution or about the nature of
our government. But chances are
that they would know something
about our political parties. At the
same time, this visibility does not
mean popularity. Most people tend

all, parties try to persuade people
why their policies are better than
others. They seek to implement
these policies by winning popular
support through elections.

Partisan: A person
who is strongly
committed to a
party, group or
faction. Partisanship
is marked by a
tendency to take a
side and inability
to take a balanced
view on an issue.

Thus, parties reflect fundamental
political divisions in a society. Parties
are about a part of the society and
thus, involve partisanship. Thus,
a party is known by which part it
stands for, which policies it supports
and whose interests it upholds. A
political party has three components:
 the leaders,
 the active members and
 the followers

Functions
What does a political party do?
Basically, political parties fill political
offices and exercise political power.
Parties do so by performing a series
of functions:
1 Parties contest elections. In most
democracies, elections are fought

mainly among the candidates put
up by political parties. Parties select
their candidates in different ways.
In some countries, such as the USA,
members and supporters of a party
choose its candidates. Now more
and more countries are following
this method. In other countries
like India, top party leaders choose
candidates for contesting elections.
2 Parties put forward different
policies and programmes and the
voters choose from them. Each of
us may have different opinions and
views on what policies are suitable
for the society. But no government
can handle such a large variety
of views. In a democracy, a large
number of similar opinions have
to be grouped together to provide
a direction in which policies can
be formulated by the governments.
This is what the parties do. A party
reduces a vast multitude of opinions
into a few basic positions which it

48

Chapter 4.indd 48

08-04-2022 12:33:33

3 Parties play a decisive role
in making laws for a country.
Formally, laws are debated and
passed in the legislature. But since
most of the members belong to a
party, they go by the direction of
the party leadership, irrespective of
their personal opinions.
4 Parties form and run governments.
As we noted last year, the big policy
decisions are taken by political
executive that comes from the
political parties. Parties recruit
leaders, train them and then
make them ministers to run the
government in the way they want.
5 Those parties that lose in the
elections play the role of opposition
to the parties in power, by voicing
different views and criticising
government for its failures or
wrong policies. Opposition parties
also mobilise opposition to the
government.
6 Parties shape public opinion.
They raise and highlight issues.
Parties have lakhs of members and
activists spread all over the country.
Many of the pressure groups are the
extensions of political parties among
different sections of society. Parties
sometimes also launch movements
for the resolution of problems
faced by people. Often opinions in
the society crystallise on the lines
parties take.
7 Parties provide people access
to government machinery and
welfare schemes implemented by
governments. For an ordinary citizen
it is easy to approach a local party
leader than a government officer.

That is why, they feel close to parties
even when they do not fully trust
them. Parties have to be responsive
to people’s needs and demands.
Otherwise people can reject those
parties in the next elections.

Necessity
This list of functions in a sense
answers the question asked above:
we need political parties because
they perform all these functions.
But we still need to ask why modern
democracies cannot exist without
political parties. We can understand
the necessity of political parties by
imagining a situation without parties.
Every candidate in the elections
will be independent. So no one
will be able to make any promises
to the people about any major
policy changes. The government
may be formed, but its utility will
remain ever uncertain. Elected
representatives will be accountable
to their constituency for what they
do in the locality. But no one will
be responsible for how the country
will be run.
We can also think about it by
looking at the non-party based
elections to the panchayat in many
states. Although, the parties do not
contest formally, it is generally
noticed that the village gets split into
more than one faction, each of which
puts up a ‘panel’ of its candidates.
This is exactly what the party does.
That is the reason we find political
parties in almost all countries of the
world, whether these countries are
big or small, old or new, developed
or developing.
The rise of political parties is
directly linked to the emergence
of representative democracies.

Okay, granted
that we can’t
live without
political parties.
But tell me on
what grounds do
people support a
political party?

Ruling Party: Political
party that runs
government.

Po l i t i c a l Pa r t i e s

supports. A government is expected
to base its policies on the line taken
by the ruling party.

As we have seen, large societies
need representative democracy.
As societies became large and
complex, they also needed some
agency to gather different views
on various issues and to present
these to the government. They
needed some ways, to bring various
representatives together so that a

responsible government could be
formed. They needed a mechanism to
support or restrain the government,
make policies, justify or oppose
them. Political parties fulfill these
needs that every representative
government has. We can say that
parties are a necessary condition for
a democracy.

How many parties should we have?
In a democracy any group of citizens
is free to form a political party. In
this formal sense, there are a large
number of political parties in each
country. More than 750 parties
are registered with the Election
Commission of India. But not all
these parties are serious contenders
in the elections. Usually only a
handful of parties are effectively in

the race to win elections and form
the government. So the question is:
how many major or effective parties
are good for a democracy?
In some countries, only one
party is allowed to control and run
the government. These are called
one-party systems. In Class IX,
we noted that in China, only the
Communist Party is allowed to

50

In some countries, power usually
changes between two main parties.
Several other parties may exist,
contest elections and win a few seats
in the national legislatures. But only
the two main parties have a serious
chance of winning majority of seats
to form government. Such a party
system is called two-party system.
The United States of America and
the United Kingdom are examples
of two-party system.
If several parties compete for
power, and more than two parties
have a reasonable chance of coming
to power either on their own strength
or in alliance with others, we call it
a multiparty system. Thus in India,
we have a multiparty system. In this
system, the government is formed by
various parties coming together in a

coalition. When several parties in a
multi-party system join hands for the
purpose of contesting elections and
winning power, it is called an alliance
or a front. For example, in India
there were three such major alliances
in 2004 parliamentary elections– the
National Democratic Alliance, the
United Progressive Alliance and the
Left Front. The multiparty system
often appears very messy and leads
to political instability. At the same
time, this system allows a variety
of interests and opinions to enjoy
political representation.
So, which of these is better?
Perhaps the best answer to this very
common question is that this is not
a very good question. Party system
is not something any country can
choose. It evolves over a long time,
depending on the nature of society,
its social and regional divisions, its
history of politics and its system of
elections. These cannot be changed
very quickly. Each country develops a
party system that is conditioned by its
special circumstances. For example, if
India has evolved a multiparty system,
it is because the social and geographical
diversity in such a large country is
not easily absorbed by two or even
three parties. No system is ideal for all
countries and all situations.

I wonder how
politicians
manage these
coalitions. I can’t
even remember
the names of all
the parties.

Let us apply what we have learnt about party systems to the various
states within India. Here are three major types of party systems that
exist at the State level. Can you find the names of at least two States for
each of these types?
 Two-party system
 Multiparty system with two alliances
 Multiparty system

rule. Although, legally speaking,
people are free to form political
parties, it does not happen because
the electoral system does not permit
free competition for power. We
cannot consider one-party system as
a good option because this is not a
democratic option. Any democratic
system must allow at least two parties
to compete in elections and provide a
fair chance for the competing parties
to come to power.

Popular
participation It is often said that political parties are facing a
crisis because they are very unpopular and the
in
citizens are indifferent to political parties. The
political parties
available evidence shows that this belief is only
partly true for India. The evidence, based on a series of large
sample surveys conducted over several decades, shows that:
 Political parties do not enjoy much trust among the people in
South Asia. The proportion of those who say their trust in political
parties is ‘not much’ or ‘not at all’ is more than those who have
‘some’ or ‘great’ trust.
 The same is true of most other democracies as well. Political
parties are one of the least trusted institutions all over the world.
 Yet the level of participation in the activities of political parties
was fairly high. The proportion of those who said they were
members of some political party was higher in India than many
advanced countries like Canada, Japan, Spain and South Korea.
 Over the last three decades, the proportion of those who
report to be members of
political parties in India has
gone up steadily.

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

 The proportion of those
who say they feel ‘close to
a political party’ has also
gone up in India in this
period.

National parties

Every party in the country
has to register with the Election
Commission. While the Commission
treats all parties equally, it offers
some special facilities to large and
established parties. These parties
are given a unique symbol – only
the ofﬁcial candidates of that party
can use that election symbol. Parties
that get this privilege and some other

special facilities are ‘recognised’ by
the Election Commission for this
purpose. That is why these parties
are called, ‘recognised political
parties’. The Election Commission
has laid down detailed criteria of
the proportion of votes and seats
that a party must get in order to
be a recognised party. A party that
secures at least six per cent of the
total votes in an election to the
Legislative Assembly of a State and
wins at least two seats is recognised
as a State party. A party that secures
at least six per cent of the total votes
in Lok Sabha elections or Assembly
elections in four States and wins at
least four seats in the Lok Sabha is
recognised as a national party.
According to this classiﬁcation,
there are six recognized national
parties in the country as per
notification of the Election
Commission of India issued in 2023.

Democracies that follow a federal
system all over the world tend to
have two kinds of political parties:
parties that are present in only one of
the federal units and parties that are
present in several or all units of the
federation. This is the case in India
as well. There are some country-wide
parties, which are called ‘national
parties’. These parties have their
units in various states. But by and
large, all these units follow the same
policies, programmes and strategy
that is decided at the national level.

Aam Aadmi Party
(AAP): Formed on
26 November 2012,
following the 2011
anti-corruption movement. The
party was founded on the idea of
accountability, clean administration,
transparency and good governance.
In the year after its formation, AAP
emerged as the second largest party
in the Delhi Legislative Assembly
election. It formed a government
with the support of Indian National
Congress (INC). It also emerged
as the third front in the politics of
Gujarat after 2022 Gujarat Legislative
Assembly election. Presently, AAP
formed governments in Punjab and
Delhi. In the Lok Sabha election held
in 2019, it secured one seat in the Lok
Sabha.
Bahujan Samaj
Party (BSP):
Formed in 1984
under the leadership of Kanshi
Ram. Seeks to represent and secure
power for the bahujan samaj which
includes the dalits, adivasis, OBCs
and religious minorities. Draws
inspiration from the ideas and
teachings of Sahu Maharaj, Mahatma
Phule, Periyar Ramaswami Naicker
and Babasaheb Ambedkar. Stands for
the cause of securing the interests and
welfare of the dalits and oppressed
people. It has its main base in the
state of Uttar Pradesh and substantial
presence in neighbouring states like
Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh,
Uttarakhand, Delhi and Punjab.
Formed government in Uttar
Pradesh several times by taking
the support of different parties at
different times. In the Lok Sabha
elections held in 2019, it polled about

3.63 per cent votes and secured 10
seats in the Lok Sabha.
Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP): Founded in 1980
by reviving the erstwhile
Bharatiya Jana Sangh,
formed by Syama Prasad
Mukherjee in 1951. Wants to build a
strong and modern India by drawing
inspiration from India’s ancient
culture and values; and Deendayal
Upadhyaya’s ideas of integral
humanism and Antyodaya. Cultural
nationalism (or ‘Hindutva’) is an
important element in its conception
of Indian nationhood and politics.
Wants full territorial and political
integration of Jammu and Kashmir
with India, a uniform civil code
for all people living in the country
irrespective of religion, and ban on
religious conversions. Its support
base increased substantially in the
1990s. Earlier limited to north and
west and to urban areas, the party
expanded its support in the south,
east, the north-east and to rural areas.
Came to power in 1998 as the leader
of the National Democratic Alliance
(NDA) including several regional
parties. Emerged as the largest party
with 303 members in the 2019 Lok
Sabha elections. Currently leads
the ruling NDA government at
the Centre.
Communist Party

Bengal, Kerala and Tripura, especially
among the poor, factory workers,
farmers, agricultural labourers and
the intelligentsia. Critical of the new
economic policies that allow free flow
of foreign capital and goods into the
country. Was in power in West Bengal
without a break for 34 years. In the 2019
Lok Sabha elections, it won about 1.75
per cent of votes and 3 seats.
Indian National Congress
(INC): Popularly known
as the Congress Party. One
of the oldest parties of the
world. Founded in 1885 and
has experienced many splits. Played
a dominant role in Indian politics at
the national and state level for several
decades after India’s Independence.
Under the leadership of Jawaharlal
Nehru, the party sought to build a
modern secular democratic republic in
India. Ruling party at the centre till 1977
and then from 1980 to 1989. After 1989,
its support declined, but it continues
to be present throughout the country,
cutting across social divisions. A centrist
party (neither rightist nor leftist) in

its ideological orientation, the party
espouses secularism and welfare of
weaker sections and minorities. The
INC supports new economic reforms
but with a human face. Leader of the
United Progressive Alliance (UPA)
government from 2004 to 2019. In the
2019 Lok Sabha election, it won 19.5%
votes and 52 seats.
National People’s Party
(NPP): Formed in July 2013
under the leadership of P.A
Sangma. NPP is the first
political party from North
East India to have attained
the status of a national party. It
believes in diversity of the country and
recognizes that different regions have
different developmental challenges.
The core philosophy of the party is
education and employment to all as
well as empowerment of all sections of
the society. It formed government in
Meghalaya and has presence in many of
North Eastern States. In the Lok Sabha
election held in 2019, NPP secured one
seat in the Lok Sabha.

Other than these seven parties, most
of the major parties of the country are
classified by the Election Commission
as ‘State parties’. These are commonly
referred to as regional parties. Yet
these parties need not be regional in
their ideology or outlook. Some of
these parties are all India parties that
happen to have succeeded only in
some states. Parties like the Samajwadi
Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal have
national level political organisation
with units in several states. Some of
these parties like Biju Janata Dal, Sikkim
Democratic Front, Mizo National
Front and Telangana Rashtra Samithi
are conscious about their State identity.

Over the last three decades, the
number and strength of these parties has
expanded. This made the Parliament
of India politically more and more
diverse. No one national party is able
to secure on its own a majority in the
Lok Sabha, until 2014. As a result, the
national parties are compelled to form
alliances with State parties. Since 1996,
nearly every one of the State parties has
got an opportunity to be a part of one
or the other national level coalition
government. This has contributed to
the strengthening of federalism and
democracy in our country. (See the
map on the next page for details of
these parties).

Challenges to political parties

© Riber Hansson - Svenska Dagbladet, Cagle Cartoons Inc.

Berlusconi Puppet Theatre

in the working of political parties.
Political parties need to face and
overcome these challenges in order
to remain effective instruments
of democracy.
The first challenge is lack of
internal democracy within parties.
All over the world there is a tendency
in political parties towards the
concentration of power in one or
few leaders at the top. Parties do not
keep membership registers, do not
hold organisational meetings, and
do not conduct internal elections
regularly. Ordinary members of
the party do not get sufficient
information on what happens inside
the party. They do
not have the means
or the connections
needed to influence
the decisions. As a
result, the leaders
assume greater
power to make
decisions in the
name of the party.
Since one or few
leaders exercise
paramount power
in the party, those
who disagree with
the leadership find

Berlusconi was the Prime
Minister of Italy. He is also
one of the top businessmen
in Italy. He is the leader of
the Forza Italia founded in
1993. His company owns TV
channels, the most important
publishing company, a foot
ball club (AC Milan) and a
bank. This cartoon was made
during the last elections.

Why don’t
parties give
enough tickets
to women? Is
that also due to
lack of internal
democracy?

Po l i t i c a l Pa r t i e s

We have seen how crucial political
parties are for the working of
democracy. Since parties are the
most visible face of democracy, it is
natural that people blame parties for
whatever is wrong with the working
of democracy. All over the world,
people express strong dissatisfaction
with the failure of political parties
to perform their functions well.
This is the case in our country too.
Popular dissatisfaction and criticism
has focussed on four problem areas

57

it difficult to continue in the party.
More than loyalty to party principles
and policies, personal loyalty to the
leader becomes more important.

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

The second challenge of dynastic
succession is related to the first
one. Since most political parties do
not practice open and transparent
procedures for their functioning,
there are very few ways for an
ordinary worker to rise to the top
in a party. Those who happen to be
the leaders are in a position of unfair
advantage to favour people close to
them or even their family members.
In many parties, the top positions
are always controlled by members
of one family. This is unfair to other
members of that party. This is also
bad for democracy, since people who
do not have adequate experience or
popular support come to occupy
positions of power. This tendency
is present in some measure all over
the world, including in some of the
older democracies.  

The third challenge is about
the growing role of money and
muscle power in parties, especially
during elections. Since parties are
focussed only on winning elections,
they tend to use short-cuts to win
elections. They tend to nominate
those candidates who have or can
raise lots of money. Rich people and
companies who give funds to the
parties tend to have influence on the
policies and decisions of the party. In
some cases, parties support criminals
who can win elections. Democrats
all over the world are worried about
the increasing role of rich people and
big companies in democratic politics.
The fourth challenge is that
very often parties do not seem to
offer a meaningful choice to the
voters. In order to offer meaningful
choice, parties must be significantly
different. In recent years, there has
been a decline in the ideological
differences among parties in most
parts of the world. For example,
the difference between the Labour
Party and the Conservative Party
in Britain is very little. They agree
on more fundamental aspects but
differ only in details on how policies
are to be framed and implemented.
In our country too, the differences
among all the major parties on the
economic policies have reduced.
Those who want really different
policies have no option available
to them. Sometimes people cannot
even elect very different leaders
either, because the same set of
leaders keep shifting from one
party to another.

This cartoon was drawn during the Presidency of George Bush of the
Republican Party in the USA. The party’s symbol is elephant. The cartoon
seems to suggest that the Corporate America controls all major institutions
of the country.

Does this
suggest that
in democracies
people contest
elections only to
make money?
But isn’t it
true that there
are politicians
committed to
the well-being
of the people?

Can you identify which of the challenges described in this section are being
highlighted in these cartoons (on pages 57 to 59)? What are the ways to

leaders. If all of them do not wish to
reform, how can anyone force them
to change?
Let us look at some of the
recent efforts and suggestions in our
country to reform political parties
and its leaders:
 The Constitution was amended
to prevent elected MLAs and MPs
from changing parties. This was done
because many elected representatives
were indulging in defection in order
to become ministers or for cash
rewards. Now the law says that if

Defection: Changing
party allegiance from
the party on which a
person got elected (to
a legislative body) to
a different party.

Po l i t i c a l Pa r t i e s

In order to face these challenges,
political parties need to be reformed.
The question is: Are political parties
willing to reform? If they are willing,
what has prevented them from
reforming so far? If they are not
willing, is it possible to force them
to reform? Citizens all over the
world face this question. This is not
a simple question to answer. In a
democracy, the final decision is made
by leaders who represent political
parties. People can replace them,
but only by another set of party

is mere formality. It is not clear if
this step has led to greater internal
democracy in political parties.
Besides these, many suggestions
are often made to reform political
parties:

 A law should be made to regulate
the internal affairs of political parties.
It should be made compulsory for
political parties to maintain a register
of its members, to follow its own
constitution, to have an independent
authority, to act as a judge in case of
party disputes, to hold open elections
to the highest posts.
Do you agree that this form of reforming political parties will be
acceptable to them?

any MLA or MP changes parties,

political parties to give a minimum
number of tickets, about one-third,
to women candidates. Similarly,
there should be a quota for women
in the decision making bodies of
the party.
 There should be state funding of
elections. The government should
give parties money to support their
election expenses. This support
could be given in kind: petrol, paper,
telephone, etc. Or it could be given in
cash on the basis of the votes secured
by the party in the last election.
These suggestions have not yet
been accepted by political parties. If
and when these are accepted these
could lead to some improvement.
But we must be very careful about
legal solutions to political problems.
Over-regulation of political parties
can be counter-productive. This
would force all parties to find ways
to cheat the law. Besides, political
parties will not agree to pass a law
that they do not like.
There are two other ways
in which political parties can be
reformed. One, people can put

pressure on political parties. This can
be done through petitions, publicity
and agitations. Ordinary citizens,
pressure groups and movements and
the media can play an important role
in this. If political parties feel that
they would lose public support by
not taking up reforms, they would
become more serious about reforms.
Two, political parties can improve if

those who want this, join political
parties. The quality of democracy
depends on the degree of public
participation. It is difficult to reform
politics if ordinary citizens do not
take part in it and simply criticise
it from the outside. The problem of

Muhammad Yunus is a famous economist of Bangladesh.
He received several international honours for his efforts to
promote economic and social development for the benefit of
the poor. He and the Grameen Bank that he started jointly,
received the Nobel Peace Prize for the year 2006. In February
2007, he decided to launch a political party and contest in the
parliamentary elections. His objective was to foster proper
leadership, good governance and build a new Bangladesh.
He felt that only a political party different from the traditional
ones would bring about new political culture. His party would
be democratic from the grassroots level.

			 The launching of the new party, called Nagarik Shakti
(Citizens’ Power), has caused a stir among the Bangladeshis.
While many welcomed his decision, some did not like it. “Now
I think Bangladesh will have a chance to choose between
good and bad and eventually have a good government,” said
Shahedul Islam, a government official. “That government, we
hope, would not only keep itself away from corruption but also
make fighting corruption and black money a top priority.”
			 But leaders of traditional political parties who dominated
the country’s politics for decades were apprehensive. “There
was no debate (over him) winning the Nobel, but politics is
different – very challenging and often controversial,” said
a senior leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Some
others were highly critical. They asked why he was rushing
into politics. “Is he being planted in politics by mentors from
outside the country,” asked one political observer.
Do you think Yunus made a right decision to float a new political
party?
Do you agree with the statements and fears expressed by various
people? How do you want this new party organised to make it
different from other parties? If you were the one to begin this
political party, how would you defend it?

Outcomes of
Democracy

Outcomes of Democracy

As we begin to wind up our tour of democracy, it is time to move
beyond our discussion of specific themes and ask a general set of
questions: What does democracy do? Or, what outcomes can we
reasonably expect of democracy? Also, does democracy fulfil these
expectations in real life? We begin by thinking about how to assess
the outcomes of democracy. After some clarity on how to think on
this subject, we proceed to look at the expected and actual outcomes
of democracy in various respects: quality of government, economic
well-being, inequality, social differences and conflict and finally
freedom and dignity.

How do we assess democracy’s outcomes?

Did we
reach these
conclusions
in Madam
Lyngdoh’s class?
I loved that
class because
students were
not being
dictated any
conclusions.

Do you remember how students
in Madam Lyngdoh’s class argued
about democracy? This was in
Chapter 2 of Class IX textbook.
It emerged from that conversation
that democracy is a better form of
government when compared with
dictatorship or any other alternative.
We felt that democracy was better
because it:
 Promotes equality among
citizens;
 Enhances the dignity of the
individual;
 Improves the quality of
decision-making;
 Provides a method to resolve
conflicts; and
 Allows room to correct mistakes.

Are these expectations realised
under democracies? When we talk
to people around us, most of them
support democracy against other
alternatives, such as rule by a monarch
or military or religious leaders. But
not so many of them would be
satisfied with the democracy in
practice. So we face a dilemma:
democracy is seen to be good in

Is democracy all about coping with multiple pressures and
accommodating diverse demands?

principle, but felt to be not so good in
its practice. This dilemma invites us
to think hard about the outcomes of
democracy. Do we prefer democracy
only for moral reasons? Or are there
some prudential reasons to support
democracy too?
Over a hundred countries of
the world today claim and practice
some kind of democratic politics:
they have formal constitutions, they
hold elections, they have parties and
they guarantee rights of citizens.
While these features are common to
most of them, these democracies are
very much different from each other
in terms of their social situations,
their economic achievements and
their cultures. Clearly, what may be
achieved or not achieved under each
of these democracies will be very
different. But is there something that
we can expect from every democracy,
just because it is democracy?
Our interest in and fascination
for democracy often pushes us into
taking a position that democracy
can address all socio-economic and
political problems. If some of our
expectations are not met, we start
blaming the idea of democracy. Or,
we start doubting if we are living in
a democracy. The first step towards
thinking carefully about the outcomes
of democracy is to recognise
that democracy is just a form
of government. It can only create
conditions for achieving something.
The citizens have to take advantage
of those conditions and achieve
those goals. Let us examine some of
the things we can reasonably expect
from democracy and examine the
record of democracy.

Accountable, responsive and legitimate government

Let us think in terms of costs.
Imagine a government that may
take decisions very fast. But it may
take decisions that are not accepted
by the people and may therefore
face problems. In contrast, the
democratic government will take
more time to follow procedures
before arriving at a decision. But
because it has followed procedures,
its decisions may be both more
acceptable to the people and more
effective. So, the cost of time that
democracy pays is perhaps worth it.

Now look at the other side –
democracy ensures that decision
making will be based on norms and
procedures. So, a citizen who wants
to know if a decision was taken
through the correct procedures
can find this out. She has the right
and the means to examine the
process of decision making. This
is known as transparency. This
factor is often missing from a
non-democratic government.
Therefore, when we are trying to
find out the outcomes of democracy,
it is right to expect democracy to
produce a government that follows
procedures and is accountable to the
people. We can also expect that the
democratic government develops
mechanisms for citizens to hold
the government accountable and
mechanisms for citizens to take part
in decision making whenever they
think fit.
If you wanted to measure
democracies on the basis of this
expected outcome, you would look
for the following practices and
institutions: regular, free and fair
elections; open public debate on

Can you think of
what and how the
government knows
about you and your
family (for example
ration cards and
voter identity cards)?
What are the sources
of information for
you about the
government?

Outcomes of Democracy

Before we go into this question,
we face another common question: Is
the democratic government efficient?
Is it effective? Some people think that
democracy produces less effective
government. It is, of course, true that
non-democratic rulers do not have to
bother about deliberation in assemblies
or worry about majorities and public
opinion. So, they can be very quick
and efficient in decision making
and implementation. Democracy
is based on the idea of deliberation
and negotiation. So, some delay is
bound to take place. Does that make
democratic government inefficient?

Governmental Secrecy

There are some things that democracy
must provide. In a democracy, we
are most concerned with ensuring
that people will have the right
to choose their rulers and people
will have control over the rulers.
Whenever possible and necessary,
citizens should be able to participate
in decision making, that affects
them all. Therefore, the most basic
outcome of democracy should
be that it produces a government
that is accountable to the citizens,
and responsive to the needs and
expectations of the citizens.

major policies and legislations;
and citizens’ right to information
about the government and its
functioning. The actual performance
of democracies shows a mixed
record on this. Democracies have
had greater success in setting up
regular and free elections and in
setting up conditions for open
public debate. But most democracies
fall short of elections that provide
a fair chance to everyone and in
subjecting every decision to public
debate. Democratic governments do
not have a very good record when
it comes to sharing information
with citizens. All one can say in
favour of democratic regimes is
that they are much better than any
non-democratic regime in
these respects.

So, the best
outcome of
democracy
is that it is a
democracy! That
is what we have
discovered after
all this mental
gymnastics?

In substantive terms, it may be
reasonable to expect from democracy
a government that is attentive to the
needs and demands of the people
and is largely free of corruption.
The record of democracies is not
impressive on these two counts.
Democracies often frustrate the
needs of the people and often ignore

the demands of a majority of its
population. The routine tales of
corruption are enough to convince us
that democracy is not free of this evil.
At the same time, there is nothing
to show that non-democracies are
less corrupt or more sensitive to
the people.
There is one respect in which
democratic government is certainly
better than its alternatives: democratic government is legitimate
government. It may be slow,
less efficient, not always very
responsive or clean. But a democratic
government is people’s own
government. That is why, there is
an overwhelming support for the
idea of democracy all over the world.
As the accompanying evidence from
South Asia shows, the support
exists in countries with democratic
regimes as well as countries without
democratic regimes. People wish to
be ruled by representatives elected
by them. They also believe that
democracy is suitable for their
country. Democracy’s ability to
generate its own support is itself an
outcome that cannot be ignored.

Economic growth and development
If democracies are expected to
produce good governments, then
is it not fair to expect that they
would also produce development?
Evidence shows that in practice,
many democracies did not fulfil this
expectation.
If you consider all democracies
and all dictatorships for the fifty
years between 1950 and 2000,
dictatorships have slightly higher rate
of economic growth. The inability
of democracy to achieve higher
economic development worries us.
But this alone cannot be reason
to reject democracy. As you have
already studied in economics,
economic development depends on
several factors: country’s population

size, global situation, cooperation
from other countries, economic
priorities adopted by the country,
etc. However, the difference in the
rates of economic development
between less developed countries
with dictatorships and democracies
is negligible. Overall, we cannot say
that democracy is a guarantee of
economic development. But we can
expect democracy not to lag behind
dictatorships in this respect.
When we find such significant
difference in the rates of economic
growth between countries under
dictatorship and democracy, it is
better to prefer democracy as it has
several other positive outcomes.

of democracy

Arguments about democracy tend to be
Poor Kids
very passionate. This is how it should
be, for democracy appeals to some of
our deep values. These debates cannot
be resolved in a simple manner. But
some debates about democracy can and
should be resolved by referring to some
facts and figures. The debate about the
economic outcomes of democracy is
one such debate. Over the years, many
students of democracy have gathered
careful evidence to see what the
relationship of democracy with economic
growth and economic inequalities is.
The tables and the cartoon here present
some of the evidences:
 Table 1 shows that on an average dictatorial regimes have had a slightly better record
of economic growth. But when we compare their record only in poor countries, there is
virtually no difference.
 Table 2 shows that within democracies there can be very high degree of inequalities.
In democratic countries like South Africa and Brazil, the top 20 per cent people take away
more than 60 per cent of the national income, leaving less than 3 per cent for the bottom
20 per cent population. Countries like Denmark and Hungary are much better in this
respect.
 You can see in the cartoon, there is often inequality of opportunities available to the
poorer sections.

What would be your verdict on democracy if you had to base it purely on economic
performance of democratic regimes in terms of growth and equal distribution?

Reduction of inequality and poverty

© Ares - Best of Latin America, Cagle Cartoons Inc.

Voice of the Poor

Democracies are based on political
equality. All individuals have equal
weight in electing representatives.
Parallel to the process of bringing
individuals into the political arena
on an equal footing, we find growing
economic inequalities. A small
number of ultra-rich enjoy a highly
disproportionate share of wealth and
incomes. Not only that, their share
in the total income of the country
has been increasing. Those at the
bottom of the society have very little
to depend upon. Their incomes have
been declining. Sometimes they find
it difficult to meet their basic needs
of life, such as food, clothing, house,
education and health.
In actual life, democracies do
not appear to be very successful in
reducing economic inequalities. In
Class IX Economics textbook, you
have already studied about poverty in
India. The poor constitute a large
proportion of our voters and no
party will like to lose their
votes. Yet democratically
elected governments do
not appear to be as keen
to address the question
of poverty as you would
expect them to. The
situation is much worse
in some other countries.
In Bangladesh, more than
half of its population
lives in poverty. People
in several poor countries
are now dependent on the
rich countries even for
food supplies.

Democracy is
a rule of the
majority. The
poor are in
majority. So
democracy must
be a rule of the
poor. How can
this not be the
case?

Outcomes of Democracy

Perhaps more than development, it
is reasonable to expect democracies
to reduce economic disparities. Even
when a country achieves economic
growth, will wealth be distributed
in such a way that all citizens of the
country will have a share and lead
a better life? Is economic growth
in democracies accompanied by
increased inequalities among the
people? Or do democracies lead
to a just distribution of goods and
opportunities?

Accommodation of social diversity

All you are
saying is that
democracy
ensures that
people do not
break each
other’s head.
This is not
harmony. Should
we be happy
about it?

Do democracies lead to peaceful and
harmonious life among citizens?
It will be a fair expectation that
democracy should produce a
harmonious social life. We have
seen in the earlier chapters how
democracies accommodate various
social divisions. We saw in the first
chapter how Belgium has successfully
negotiated differences among ethnic
populations. Democracies usually
develop a procedure to conduct
their competition. This reduces
the possibility of these tensions
becoming explosive or violent.
No society can fully and
permanently resolve conflicts among
different groups. But we can certainly
learn to respect these differences and
we can also evolve mechanisms to
negotiate the differences. Democracy
is best suited to produce this
outcome. Non-democratic regimes

often turn a blind eye to or suppress
internal social differences. Ability to
handle social differences, divisions
and conflicts is thus a definite plus
point of democratic regimes. But
the example of Sri Lanka reminds
us that a democracy must fulfil two
conditions in order to achieve this
outcome:
 It is necessary to understand
that democracy is not simply rule
by majority opinion. The majority
always needs to work with the
minority so that governments
function to represent the general
view. Majority and minority
opinions are not permanent.
 It is also necessary that rule by
majority does not become rule by
majority community in terms of
religion or race or linguistic group,
etc. Rule by majority means that in
case of every decision or in case of

70
Reprint 2025-26
Chapter 5.indd 70

08-04-2022 12:36:56

every election, different persons and
groups may and can form a majority.
Democracy remains democracy only
as long as every citizen has a chance
of being in majority at some point

of time. If someone is barred from
being in majority on the basis of
birth, then the democratic rule ceases
to be accommodative for that person
or group.

Enemies

Democracy stands much superior
to any other form of government
in promoting dignity and freedom
of the individual. Every individual
wants to receive respect from
fellow beings. Often conflicts arise
among individuals because some feel
that they are not treated with due
respect. The passion for respect and
freedom are the basis of democracy.
Democracies throughout the world
have recognised this, at least in
principle. This has been achieved

in various degrees in various
democracies. For societies which
have been built for long on the basis
of subordination and domination, it
is not a simple matter to recognise
that all individuals are equal.
Take the case of dignity of
women. Most societies across
the world were historically male
dominated societies. Long struggles
by women have created some
sensitivity today that respect to
and equal treatment of women are

necessary ingredients of a democratic
society. That does not mean that
women are actually always treated
with respect. But once the principle
is recognised, it becomes easier for
women to wage a struggle against
what is now unacceptable legally
and morally. In a non-democratic
set up, this unacceptability would
not have legal basis because the
principle of individual freedom and
dignity would not have the legal and
moral force there. The same is true
of caste inequalities. Democracy in
India has strengthened the claims of
the disadvantaged and discriminated
castes for equal status and equal
opportunity. There are instances
still of caste-based inequalities and
atrocities, but these lack the moral
and legal foundations. Perhaps, it is
the recognition that makes ordinary
citizens value their democratic rights.
Expectations from democracy
also function as the criteria for
judging any democratic country.

What is most distinctive about
democracy is that its examination
never gets over. As democracy
passes one test, it produces another
test. As people get some benefits of
democracy, they ask for more and
want to make democracy even better.
That is why, when we ask people
about the way democracy functions,
they will always come up with more
expectations, and many complaints.
The fact that people are complaining
is itself a testimony to the success of
democracy: it shows that people have
developed awareness and the ability
to expect and to look critically at
power holders and the high and
the mighty. A public expression of
dissatisfaction with democracy shows
the success of the democratic project:
it transforms people from the status
of a subject into that of a citizen.
Most individuals today believe that
their vote makes a difference to the
way the government is run and to
their own self-interest.

8. Read the passage below:
Nannu is a daily wage earner. He lives in Welcome Mazdoor
Colony, a slum habitation in East Delhi. He lost his ration card
and applied for a duplicate one in January 2004. He made
several rounds to the local Food and Civil Supplies office for
the next three months. But the clerks and officials would
not even look at him, leave alone do his job or bother to
tell him the status of his application. Ultimately, he filed an
application under the Right to Information Act asking for the
daily progress made on his application, names of the officials,
who were supposed to act on his application and what action
would be taken against these officials for their inaction. Within
a week of filing application under the Right to Information Act,
he was visited by an inspector from the Food Department,
who informed him that the card had been made and he could
collect it from the office. When Nannu went to collect his card
next day, he was given a very warm treatment by the Food
and Supply Officer (FSO), who is the head of a Circle. The FSO
offered him tea and requested him to withdraw his application
under the Right to Information, since his work had already
been done.
What does Nannu’s example show? What impact did Nannu’s
action have on officials? Ask your parents their experiences
when they approach government officials to attend to their
problems.

Belgium and Sri Lanka

I have a simple
equation in mind.
Sharing power =
dividing power =
weakening the
country. Why do we
start by talking of
this?

Belgium is a small country in Europe,
smaller in area than the state of
Haryana. It has borders with France,
the Netherlands, Germany and
Luxembourg. It has a population of
a little over one crore, about half the
population of Haryana. The ethnic
composition of this small country is
very complex. Of the country’s total
population, 59 per cent lives in the
Flemish region and speaks Dutch
language. Another 40 per cent people
live in the Wallonia region and speak
French. Remaining one per cent of
the Belgians speak German. In the
capital city Brussels, 80 per cent
people speak French while 20 per
cent are Dutch-speaking.
The minority French-speaking
community was relatively rich and
powerful. This was resented by the
Dutch-speaking community who got
the benefit of economic development
and education much later. This led

to tensions between the Dutchspeaking and French-speaking
communities during the 1950s and
1960s. The tension between the
two communities was more acute
in Brussels. Brussels presented a
special problem: the Dutch-speaking
people constituted a majority in
the country, but a minority in the
capital.
Let us compare this to the
situation in another country. Sri
Lanka is an island nation, just a few
kilometres off the southern coast
of Tamil Nadu. It has about two
crore people, about the same as in
Haryana. Like other nations in the
South Asia region, Sri Lanka has a
diverse population. The major social
groups are the Sinhala-speakers (74
per cent) and the Tamil-speakers (18
per cent). Among Tamils there are
two sub-groups. Tamil natives of
the country are called ‘Sri Lankan

Tamils’ (13 per cent). The rest,
whose forefathers came from India as
plantation workers during colonial
period, are called ‘Indian Tamils’.
As you can see from the map, Sri
Lankan Tamils are concentrated in
the north and east of the country.
Most of the Sinhala-speaking people
are Buddhists, while most of the
Tamils are Hindus or Muslims. There
are about 7 per cent Christians, who
are both Tamil and Sinhala.
Just imagine what could happen
in situations like this. In Belgium,

the Dutch community could take
advantage of its numeric majority
and force its will on the French and
German-speaking population. This
would push the conflict among
communities further. This could
lead to a very messy partition of the
country; both the sides would claim
control over Brussels. In Sri Lanka,
the Sinhala community enjoyed
an even bigger majority and could
impose its will on the entire country.
Now, let us look at what happened
in both these countries.

Sri Lanka emerged as an independent
country in 1948. The leaders of
the Sinhala community sought to
secure dominance over government
by virtue of their majority. As a
result, the democratically elected
government adopted a series of
majoritarian measures to establish
Sinhala supremacy.

result, the relations between the
Sinhala and Tamil communities
strained over time.
The Sri Lankan Tamils launched
parties and struggles for the recognition
of Tamil as an official language, for
regional autonomy and equality of
opportunity in securing education
and jobs. But their demand for more
autonomytoprovincespopulatedbythe
Tamils was repeatedly denied. By 1980s,
several political organisations were
formed demanding an independent

Tamil Eelam (state) in northern and
eastern parts of Sri Lanka.
The distrust between the two
communities turned into widespread
conflict. It soon turned into a civil
war. As a result thousands of people
of both the communities have been
killed. Many families were forced to
leave the country as refugees and many
more lost their livelihoods. The civil
war has caused a terrible setback to the
social, cultural and economic life of the
country. It ended in 2009.

that it appears like a

The Belgian leaders took a different
path. They recognised the existence
of regional differences and cultural
diversities. Between 1970 and 1993,
they amended their constitution four
times so as to work out an arrangement
that would enable everyone to live
together within the same country.
The arrangement they worked out is
different from any other country and is
very innovative. Here are some of the
elements of the Belgian model:

Apart from the Central and
the State Government, there is a
third kind of government. This
‘community government’ is elected

Read any newspaper for one week and make clippings of
news related to ongoing conflicts or wars. A group of five
students could pool their clippings together and do the following:
 Classify these conflicts by their location (your state, India,
outside India).
 Find out the cause of each of these conflicts. How many of these
are related to power sharing disputes?
 Which of these conflicts could be resolved by working out power
sharing arrangements?

What do we learn from these two
stories of Belgium and Sri Lanka?
Both are democracies. Yet, they
dealt with the question of power
sharing differently. In Belgium,
the leaders have realised that the
unity of the country is possible
only by respecting the feelings and
interests of different communities

and regions. Such a realisation
resulted in mutually acceptable
arrangements for sharing power.
Sri Lanka shows us a contrasting
example. It shows us that if a
majority community wants to
force its dominance over others
and refuses to share power, it can
undermine the unity of the country.

So you are
saying that
sharing of power
makes us more
powerful. Sounds
odd! Let me
think.

Po w e r - sh a r i n g

You might find the Belgian model
very complicated. It indeed is very
complicated, even for people living
in Belgium. But these arrangements
have worked well so far. They helped
to avoid civic strife between the two
major communities and a possible
division of the country on linguistic
lines. When many countries of

Why power sharing is desirable?

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

Thus, two different sets of reasons can
be given in favour of power sharing.
Firstly, power sharing is good because
it helps to reduce the possibility of
conflict between social groups. Since
social conflict often leads to violence
and political instability, power sharing
is a good way to ensure the stability
of political order. Imposing the will
of majority community over others
may look like an attractive option in
the short run, but in the long run it
undermines the unity of the nation.

Prudential: Based on
prudence, or on careful
calculation of gains
and losses. Prudential
decisions are usually
contrasted with decisions
based purely on moral
considerations.

The cartoon at the left refers to the
problems of running the Germany’s grand
coalition government that includes the
two major parties of the country, namely
the Christian Democratic Union and the
Social Democratic Party. The two parties
are historically rivals to each other. They
had to form a coalition government
because neither of them got clear
majority of seats on their own in the 2005
elections. They take divergent positions
on several policy matters, but still jointly
run the government.
For details about the German Parliament,
visit https://www.bundestag.de/en

Tyranny of the majority is not just
oppressive for the minority; it often
affects majority adversely as well.
There is a second, deeper reason
why power sharing is good for
democracies. Power sharing is
the very spirit of democracy. A
democratic rule involves sharing
power with those affected by its
exercise, and who have to live with
its effects. People have a right to be
consulted on how they are to be
governed. A legitimate government
is one where citizens, through
participation, acquire a stake in
the system.
Let us call the first set of reasons
prudential and the second moral.
While prudential reasons stress
that power sharing will bring out
better outcomes, moral reasons
emphasise the very act of power
sharing as valuable.

Khalil’s
dilemma

As usual, Vikram was driving the motorbike under a vow
of silence and Vetal was the pillion rider. As usual, Vetal
started telling Vikram a story to keep him awake while
driving. This time the story went as follows:

“In the city of Beirut, there lived a man called Khalil. His
parents came from different communities. His father was an Orthodox Christian and
mother a Sunni Muslim. This was not so uncommon in this modern, cosmopolitan
city. People from various communities that lived in Lebanon came to live in its
capital, Beirut. They lived together, intermingled, yet fought a bitter civil war among
themselves. One of Khalil’s uncles was killed in that war.
At the end of this civil war, Lebanon’s leaders came together and agreed to some basic
rules for power sharing among different communities. As per these rules, the country’s
President must belong to the Maronite sect of Catholic Christians. The Prime Minister
must be from the Sunni Muslim community. The post of Deputy Prime Minister is fixed
for Orthodox Christian sect and that of the Speaker for Shi’a Muslims. Under this pact,
the Christians agreed not to seek French protection and the Muslims agreed not to seek
unification with the neighbouring state of Syria.When the Christians and Muslims came
to this agreement, they were nearly equal in population. Both sides have continued to
respect this agreement though now the Muslims are in clear majority.

The story was not finished, but they had reached the TV tower
where they stopped every day. Vetal wrapped up quickly
and posed his customary question to Vikram: “If
you had the power to rewrite the rules
in Lebanon, what would you do? Would
you adopt the ‘regular’ rules followed
everywhere, as Khalil suggests? Or stick to
the old rules? Or do something else?” Vetal
did not forget to remind Vikram of their basic
pact: “If you have an answer in mind and yet
do not speak up, your mobike will freeze, and
so will you!”
Can you help poor Vikram in answering Vetal?

Po w e r - sh a r i n g

Khalil does not like this system one bit. He is a popular man with political ambition.
But under the present system, the top position is out of his reach. He does not practise
either his father’s or his mother’s religion and does not wish to be known by either. He
cannot understand why Lebanon can’t be like any other ‘normal’ democracy. “Just hold
an election, allow everyone to contest and whoever wins maximum votes becomes the
president, no matter which community he comes from. Why can’t we do that, like in
other democracies of the world?” he asks. His elders, who have seen the bloodshed of
the civil war, tell him that the present system is the best guarantee for peace…”

Forms of power-sharing
The idea of power-sharing has
emerged in opposition to the notions
of undivided political power. For a
long time, it was believed that all
power of a government must reside
in one person or group of persons
located at one place. It was felt that
if the power to decide is dispersed,
it would not be possible to take
quick decisions and to enforce them.
But these notions have changed
with the emergence of democracy.
One basic principle of democracy
is that people are the source of all
political power. In a democracy,
people rule themselves through
institutions of self-government. In
a good democratic government, due
respect is given to diverse groups
and views that exist in a society.
Everyone has a voice in the shaping
of public policies. Therefore, it
follows that in a democracy, political

and concentration of power? Can you think of some other examples to

power should be distributed among
as many citizens as possible.
In modern democracies, power
sharing arrangements can take many
forms. Let us look at some of the
most common arrangements that we
have or will come across.
1 Power is shared among different
organs of government, such as the
legislature, executive and judiciary.
Let us call this horizontal distribution
of power because it allows different
organs of government placed at
the same level to exercise different
powers. Such a separation ensures
that none of the organs can exercise
unlimited power. Each organ checks
the others. This results in a balance
of power among various institutions.
Last year, we studied that in a
democracy, even though ministers
and government officials exercise
power, they are responsible to the
Parliament or State Assemblies.
Similarly, although judges are
appointed by the executive, they can
check the functioning of executive or
laws made by the legislatures. This
arrangement is called a system of
checks and balances.
2 Power can be shared among
governments at different levels –
a general government for the entire
country and governments at the
provincial or regional level. Such a
general government for the entire
country is usually called federal
government. In India, we refer to it as
the Central or Union Government.
The governments at the provincial or
regional level are called by different
names in different countries.

Chapter 1.indd 8

08-04-2022 12:29:19

3 Power may also be shared
among different social groups,
such as the religious and linguistic
groups. ‘Community government’
in Belgium is a good example of this
arrangement. In some countries,
there are constitutional and legal
arrangements, whereby socially
weaker sections and women are
represented in the legislatures
and administration. Last year, we
studied the system of ‘reserved
constituencies’ in assemblies and
the parliament of our country. This
type of arrangement is meant to
give space in the government and
administration to diverse social

groups, who otherwise, would feel
alienated from the government. This
method is used to give minority
communities a fair share in power. In
Unit II, we shall look at various ways
of accommodating social diversities.
4 Power sharing arrangements
can also be seen in the way political
parties, pressure groups and
movements control or influence
those in power. In a democracy,
the citizens must have freedom to
choose among various contenders
f or power . In contempor ar y
democracies, this takes the form
of competition among different
parties. Such competition ensures
that power does not remain in
one hand. In the long run, power
is shared among different political
parties that represent different
ideologies and social groups.
Sometimes this kind of sharing can
be direct, when two or more parties
form an alliance to contest elections.
If their alliance is elected, they form
a coalition government and thus
share power. In a democracy, we
find interest groups, such as those of
traders, businessmen, industrialists,
farmers and industrial workers.
They also will have a share in
governmental power, either through
participation in governmental
committees or bringing influence on
the decision-making process. In Unit
III, we shall study the working of
political parties.

In my school,
the class monitor
changes every
month. Is that
what you call a
power sharing
arrangement?

Po w e r - sh a r i n g

In India, we call them State
Governments. This system is not
followed in all countries. There are
many countries where there are no
provincial or state governments.
But in those countries like ours,
where there are different levels
of government, the constitution
clearly lays down the powers of
different levels of government. This
is what they did in Belgium, but was
refused in Sri Lanka. This is called
federal division of power. The same
principle can be extended to levels
of government lower than the State
government, such as the municipality
and panchayat. Let us call division of
powers involving higher and lower
levels of government vertical division
of power. We shall study these at
some length in the next chapter.

What is federalism?

I am confused.
What do we
call the Indian
government? Is it
Union, Federal or
Central?

Let us get back to the contrast
between Belgium and Sri Lanka
that we saw in the last chapter. You
would recall that one of the key
changes made in the Constitution
of Belgium was to reduce the
power of the Central Government
and to give these powers to the
regional governments. Regional
governments existed in Belgium
even earlier. They had their roles
and powers. But all these powers
were given to these governments
and could be withdrawn by the
Central Government. The change
that took place in 1993 was that the
regional governments were given
constitutional powers that were
no longer dependent on the central
government. Thus, Belgium shifted
from a unitary to a federal form of
government. Sri Lanka continues

to be, for all practical purposes, a
unitary system where the national
government has all the powers.
Tamil leaders want Sri Lanka to
become a federal system.
Federalism is a system of
government in which the power is
divided between a central authority
and various constituent units of the
country. Usually, a federation has
two levels of government. One is the
government for the entire country
that is usually responsible for a

Though only 25 of the world’s 193 countries have federal political systems, their citizens make up 40 per cent of the
world’s population. Most of the large countries of the world are federations. Can you notice an exception to this rule in
this map?

Let us look at some of the key
features of federalism :
1 There are two or more levels (or
tiers) of government.
2 Different tiers of government
govern the same citizens, but
each tier has its own jurisdiction
in specific matters of legislation,
taxation and administration.
3 The jurisdictions of the respective
levels or tiers of government are
specified in the constitution. So the
existence and authority of each tier
of government is constitutionally
guaranteed.
4 The fundamental provisions
of the constitution cannot be
unilaterally changed by one level of
government. Such changes require
the consent of both the levels of
government.
5 Courts have the power to
interpret the constitution and
the powers of different levels of
government. The highest court
acts as an umpire if disputes arise
between
different
levels
of
government in the exercise of their
respective powers.
6 Sources of revenue for each level
of government are clearly specified
to ensure its financial autonomy.

7 The federal system thus has dual
objectives: to safeguard and promote
unity of the country, while at the
same time accommodate regional
diversity. Therefore, two aspects
are crucial for the institutions and
practice of federalism. Governments
at different levels should agree to
some rules of power-sharing. They
should also trust that each would
abide by its part of the agreement.
An ideal federal system has both
aspects : mutual trust and agreement
to live together.

If federalism
works only in
big countries,
why did Belgium
adopt it?

The exact balance of power
between the central and the state
government varies from one
federation to another. This balance
depends mainly on the historical
context in which the federation was
formed. There are two kinds of routes
through which federations have been
formed. The first route involves
independent States coming together
on their own to form a bigger unit,
so that by pooling sovereignty and
retaining identity, they can increase
their security. This type of ‘coming
together’ federations include the
USA, Switzerland and Australia. In
this first category of federations, all
the constituent States usually have
equal power and are strong vis-à-vis
the federal government.
The second route is where a
large country decides to divide its
power between the constituent
States and the national government.
India, Spain and Belgium are
examples of this kind of ‘holding
together’ federations. In this second
category, the Central Government
tends to be more powerful vis-àvis the States. Very often different
constituent units of the federation
have unequal powers. Some units
are granted special powers.

Jurisdiction: The
area over which
someone has legal
authority. The area
may be defined in
terms of geographical
boundaries or in terms
of certain kinds of
subjects.

Federalism

In this sense, federations are
contrasted with unitary governments.
Under the unitary system, either
there is only one level of government
or the sub-units are subordinate to
the central government. The central
government can pass on orders to the
provincial or the local government.
But in a federal system, the central
government cannot order the state
government to do something. State
government has powers of its own
for which it is not answerable
to the central government. Both
these governments are separately
answerable to the people.

Some Nepalese citizens were discussing the proposals on the
adoption of federalism in their new constitution. This is what some of
them said:
Khag Raj: I don’t like federalism. It would lead to reservation of seats for
different caste groups as in India.
Sarita: Ours in not a very big country. We don’t need federalism.
Babu Lal: I am hopeful that the Terai areas will get more autonomy if they get
their own state government.
Ram Ganesh: I like federalism because it will mean that powers that were earlier
enjoyed by the king will now be exercised by our elected representatives.

of these? Which of these reflect a wrong understanding of what federalism is?

What makes India a federal country?

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

We have earlier seen how small
countries like Belgium and Sri Lanka
face so many problems of managing
diversity. What about a vast country
like India, with so many languages,
religions and regions? What are
the power sharing arrangements in
our country?

Isn’t that
strange? Did
our constitution
makers not
know about
federalism? Or
did they wish
to avoid talking
about it?

Let us begin with the Constitution.
India had emerged as an independent
nation after a painful and bloody
partition. Soon after Independence,
several princely states became a part
of the country. The Constitution
declared India as a Union of States.
Although it did not use the word
federation, the Indian Union is based
on the principles of federalism.
Let us go back to the seven
features of federalism mentioned
above. We can see that all these
features apply to the provisions
of the Indian Constitution. The
Constitution originally provided
for a two-tier system of government,
the Union Government or what
we call the Central Government,
representing the Union of India
and the State governments. Later,
a third tier of federalism was added

in the form of Panchayats and
Municipalities. As in any federation,
these different tiers enjoy separate
jurisdiction. The Constitution
clearly provided a three-fold
distribution of legislative powers
between the Union Government
and the State Governments. Thus,
it contains three lists:
 Union List includes subjects
of national importance, such as
defence of the country, foreign
affairs, banking, communications
and currency. They are included
in this list because we need a
uniform policy on these matters
throughout the country. The Union
Government alone can make laws
relating to the subjects mentioned
in the Union List.
 State List contains subjects
of State and local importance,
such as police, trade, commerce,
agriculture and irrigation. The State
Governments alone can make laws
relating to the subjects mentioned
in the State List.
 C o nc ur r ent List includes
subjects of common interest to
both the Union Government as
well as the State Governments, such

16

Chapter 2.indd 16

08-04-2022 12:30:52

What about subjects that do not
fall in any of the three lists? Or subjects
like computer software that came up
after the constitution was made?
According to our constitution, the
Union Government has the power to
legislate on these ‘residuary’ subjects.
We noted above that most
federations that are formed by
‘holding together’ do not give equal
power to its constituent units. Thus,
all States in the Indian Union do not
have identical powers. Some States
enjoy a special status. States such
as Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal
Pradesh and Mizoram enjoy special
powers under certain provisions of
the Constitution of India (Article
371) due to their peculiar social
and historical circumstances. These
special powers are especially enjoyed
in relation to the protection of
land rights of indigenous peoples,
their culture and also preferential
employment in government services.
Indians who are not permanent
residents of this State cannot buy
land or house here. Similar special
provisions exist for some other States
of India as well.

There are some units of the
Indian Union which enjoy very little
power. These are areas which are
too small to become an independent
State but which could not be merged
with any of the existing States.
These areas, like Chandigarh, or
Lakshadweep or the capital city of
Delhi, are called Union Territories.
These territories do not have the
powers of a State. The Central
Government has special powers in
running these areas.
This sharing of power between
the Union Government and the State
Governments is basic to the structure
of the Constitution. It is not easy to
make changes to this power sharing
arrangement. The Parliament cannot
on its own change this arrangement.
Any change to it has to be first passed
by both the Houses of Parliament
with at least two-thirds majority.
Then it has to be ratified by the
legislatures of at least half of the
total States.
The judiciary plays an important
role in overseeing the implementation
of constitutional provisions and
procedures. In case of any dispute
about the division of powers, the
High Courts and the Supreme Court
make a decision. The Union and
State Governments have the power
to raise resources by levying taxes in
order to carry on the government
and the responsibilities assigned to
each of them.

If agriculture and
commerce are
state subjects,
why do we have
ministers of
agriculture and
commerce in the
Union cabinet?

How is federalism practised?

Linguistic States
The creation of linguistic States
was the first and a major test for
democratic politics in our country.

If you look at the political map of
India when it began its journey as a
democracy in 1947 and that of 2019,
you will be surprised by the extent
of the changes. Many old States have
vanished and many new States have
been created. Areas, boundaries
and names of the States have been
changed.
In 1947, the boundaries of several
old States of India were changed in
order to create new States. This was
done to ensure that people who
spoke the same language lived in
the same State. Some States were
created not on the basis of language
but to recognise differences based
on culture, ethnicity or geography.
These include States like Nagaland,
Uttarakhand and Jharkhand.

Federalism

Constitutional provisions are
necessary for the success of federalism
but these are not sufficient. If the
federal experiment has succeeded
in India, it is not merely because of
the clearly laid out constitutional
provisions. The real success of
federalism in India can be attributed
to the nature of democratic politics
in our country. This ensured that
the spirit of federalism, respect
for diversity and desire for living
together became shared ideals in our
country. Let us look at some of the
major ways in which this happened.

Why Hindi?
Why not
Bangla or
Telugu?

Coalition government:
A government formed
by the coming together
of at least two political
parties. Usually
partners in a coalition
form a political alliance
and adopt a common
programme.

When the demand for the
formation of States on the basis of
language was raised, some national
leaders feared that it would lead to
the disintegration of the country.
The Central Government resisted
linguistic States for some time.
But the experience has shown that
the formation of linguistic States
has actually made the country
more united. It has also made
administration easier.

think that this solution favoured the
English-speaking elite. Promotion
of Hindi continues to be the official
policy of the Government of India.
Promotion does not mean that the
Central Government can impose
Hindi on States where people speak
a different language. The flexibility
shown by Indian political leaders
helped our country avoid the kind of
situation that Sri Lanka finds itself in.

Language policy

Restructuring the Centre-State
relations is one more way in which
federalism has been strengthened
in practice. How the constitutional
arrangements for sharing power
work in reality depends to a large
extent on how the ruling parties and
leaders follow these arrangements.
For a long time, the same party
ruled both at the Centre and in most
of the States. This meant that the
State Governments did not exercise
their rights as autonomous federal
units. As and when the ruling party
at the State level was different, the
parties that ruled at the Centre tried
to undermine the power of the
States. In those days, the Central
Government would often misuse
the Constitution to dismiss the State
Governments that were controlled
by rival parties. This undermined
the spirit of federalism.

A second test for Indian federation is
the language policy. Our Constitution
did not give the status of national
language to any one language. Hindi
was identified as the official language.
But Hindi is the mother tongue of
only about 40 per cent of Indians.
Therefore, there were many safeguards
to protect other languages. Besides
Hindi, there are 22 other languages
recognised as Scheduled Languages
by the Constitution. A candidate in
an examination conducted for the
Central Government positions may
opt to take the examination in any
of these languages. States too have
their own official languages. Much
of the government work takes
place in the official language of the
concerned State.
Unlike Sri Lanka, the leaders
of our country adopted a very
cautious attitude in spreading the
use of Hindi. According to the
Constitution, the use of English
for official purposes was to stop in
1965. However, many non-Hindi
speaking States demanded that the
use of English continue. In Tamil
Nadu, this movement took a violent
form. The Central Government
responded by agreeing to continue
the use of English along with Hindi
for official purposes. Many critics

Centre-State relations

All this changed significantly
after 1990. This period saw the
rise of regional political parties in
many States of the country. This
was also the beginning of the era
of coalition governments at the
Centre. Since no single party got a
clear majority in the Lok Sabha, the
major national parties had to enter
into an alliance with many parties
including several regional parties to
form a government at the Centre.

The States Plead for More Powers

Here are two cartoons showing the relationship between Centre and States. Should the
State go to the Centre with a begging bowl? How can the leader of a coalition keep the
partners of government satisfied?

This led to a new culture of
power sharing and respect for the
autonomy of State Governments.
This trend was supported by a
major judgement of the Supreme
Court that made it difficult for the

Central Government to dismiss state
governments in an arbitrary manner.
Thus, federal power sharing is more
effective today than it was in the
early years after the Constitution
came into force.

Linguistic diversity of India

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

How many languages do we have
in India? The answer depends
on how one counts it. The latest
information that we have is from
the Census of India held in 2011.
This census recorded more than
1300 distinct languages which
people mentioned as their mother
tongues. These languages were
grouped together under some
major languages. For example,
languages like Bhojpuri, Magadhi,
Bundelkhandi, Chhattisgarhi,
Rajasthani and many others were
grouped together under ‘Hindi’.
Even after this grouping,
the Census found 121 major
languages. Of these, 22
languages are now included in
the Eighth Schedule of the Indian
Constitution and are therefore
called ‘Scheduled Languages’.
Others are called
‘non-Scheduled Languages’. In
terms of languages, India is
perhaps the most diverse country
in the world.
A look at the enclosed table
makes it clear that no one
language is the mother tongue of
the majority of our population.
The largest language, Hindi, is the
mother tongue of only about 44
per cent Indians. If we add to that
all those who knew Hindi as their
second or third language, the total
number was still less than 50 per
cent in 2011. As for English, only
0.02 per cent Indians recorded it
as their mother tongue. Another
11 per cent knew it as a second or
third language.
Read this table carefully, but
you need not memorise it. Just do
the following:

 Make a bar or pie chart on
the basis of this information.
 Prepare a map of linguistic
diversity of India by shading

Decentralisation in India

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

So, we are like a
three-tier coach
in a train! I
always prefer the
lower berth!

We noted above that federal
governments have two or more
tiers of governments. We have
so far discussed the two-tiers of
government in our country. But
a vast country like India cannot
be run only through these
two-tiers. States in India are as large as
independent countries of Europe. In
terms of population, Uttar Pradesh
is bigger than Russia, Maharashtra
is about as big as Germany. Many
of these States are internally very
diverse. There is thus a need for
power sharing within these States.
Federal power sharing in India needs
another tier of government, below
that of the State governments. This
is the rationale for decentralisation
of power. Thus, resulted a thirdtier of government, called local
government.
When power is taken away from
Central and State governments and
given to local government, it is called
decentralisation. The basic idea behind
decentralisation is that there are a large
number of problems and issues which
are best settled at the local level. People
have better knowledge of problems
in their localities. They also have
better ideas on where to spend money
and how to manage things more
efficiently. Besides, at the local level
it is possible for the people to directly
participate in decision making. This
helps to inculcate a habit of democratic
participation. Local government is the
best way to realise one important
principle of democracy, namely local
self-government.
The need for decentralisation
was recognised in our Constitution.
Since then, there have been
several attempts to decentralise

power to the level of villages and
towns. Panchayats in villages and
municipalities in urban areas were
set up in all the States. But these
were directly under the control of
state governments. Elections to these
local governments were not held
regularly. Local governments did
not have any powers or resources of
their own. Thus, there was very little
decentralisation in effective terms.
A major step towards decentralisation was taken in 1992. The
Constitution was amended to make
the third-tier of democracy more
powerful and effective.
 Now it is constitutionally
mandatory to hold regular elections
to local government bodies.
 Seats are reserved in the elected
bodies and the executive heads of
these institutions for the Scheduled
Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other
Backward Classes.
 At least one-third of all positions
are reserved for women.
 An independent institution
called the State Election Commission
has been created in each State to
conduct panchayat and municipal
elections.
 The State governments are
required to share some powers and
revenue with local government
bodies. The nature of sharing varies
from State to State.
Rural local government is
popularly known by the name
panchayati raj. Each village, or a
group of villages in some States, has
a gram panchayat. This is a council
consisting of several ward members,
often called panch, and a president
or sarpanch. They are directly

24
Reprint 2025-26

Chapter 2.indd 24

08-04-2022 12:31:16

The local government structure
goes right up to the district level. A
few gram panchayats are grouped
together to form what is usually
called a panchayat samiti or block
or mandal. The members of this
representative body are elected by all
the panchyat members in that area.
All the panchayat samitis or mandals
in a district together constitute

the zilla (district) parishad. Most
members of the zilla parishad are
elected. Members of the Lok Sabha
and MLAs of that district and some
other officials of other district level
bodies are also its members. Zilla
parishad chairperson is the political
head of the zilla parishad.
Similarly, local government
bodies exist for urban areas as
well. Municipalities are set up in
towns. Big cities are constituted
into municipal corporations. Both
municipalities and municipal
corporations are controlled
by elected bodies consisting of
people’s representatives. Municipal
chairperson is the political head of
the municipality. In a municipal
corporation, such an officer is called
the mayor.

What do these newspaper clippings have to say about efforts of decentralisation in India?

runs the country.
Chief Minister

elected by all the adult population
living in that ward or village. It is
the decision-making body for the
entire village. The panchayat works
under the overall supervision of the
gram sabha. All the voters in the
village are its members. It has to
meet at least twice or thrice in a year
to approve the annual budget of the
gram panchayat and to review the
performance of the gram panchayat.

An experiment in Brazil
A city called Porto Alegre in Brazil has carried out an extraordinary experiment
in combining decentralisation with participative democracy. The city has set up
a parallel organisation operating alongside the municipal council, enabling local
inhabitants to take real decisions for their city. The nearly 13 lakh people in this
city get to participate in making the budget for their own city. The city is divided
into many sectors or what we call wards. Each sector has a meeting, like that of
the gram sabha, in which anyone living in that area can participate. There are
some meetings to discuss issues that affect the entire city. Any citizen of the city
can participate in those meetings. The budget of the city is discussed in these
meetings. The proposals are put to the municipality that takes a final decision
about it.
About 20,000 people participate in this decision making exercise every year.
This method has ensured that the money cannot be spent only for the benefit
of the colonies where rich people live. Buses now run to the poor colonies and
builders cannot evict slum-dwellers without resettling them.
In our own country, a similar experiment has taken place in some areas in
Kerala. Ordinary people have participated in making a plan for the development
of their locality.

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

This new system of local
government is the largest experiment
in democracy conducted anywhere
in the world. There are now about
36 lakh elected representatives in
the panchayats and municipalities
etc., all over the country. This
number is bigger than the population
of many countries in the world.
Constitutional status for local
government has helped to deepen
democracy in our country. It has also

increased women’s representation
and voice in our democracy. At
the same time, there are many
difficulties. While elections are
held regularly and enthusiastically,
gram sabhas are not held regularly.
Most state governments have not
transferred significant powers to the
local governments. Nor have they
given adequate resources. We are
thus still a long way from realising
the ideal of self-government.

If you live in a village, find out the names of the following: your panch or
ward member, your sarpanch, your panchayat samiti, the chairperson of your zilla

The existence of social diversity does not threaten democracy. Political
expression of social differences is possible and sometimes quite desirable
in a democratic system. In this chapter we apply these ideas to the practice
of democracy in India. We look at three kinds of social differences that
can take the form of social divisions and inequalities. These are social
differences based on gender, religion and caste. In each case we look at
the nature of this division in India and how it gets expressed in politics.
We also ask whether different expressions based on these differences are
healthy or otherwise in a democracy.

Sexual division of labour:
A system in which all
work inside the home
is either done by the
women of the family,
or organised by them
through the domestic
helpers.

Why are we
discussing things
like household
work in this
textbook on
Political Science?
Is this politics?

Let us begin with gender division.
This is a form of hierarchical social
division seen everywhere, but is
rarely recognised in the study of
politics. The gender division tends
to be understood as natural and
unchangeable. However, it is not
based on biology but on social
expectations and stereotypes.

Why not? If
politics is about
power, then
surely male
dominance in the
household should
be considered
political.

Boys and girls are brought up to
believe that the main responsibility
of women is housework and bringing
up children. This is reflected in a
sexual division of labour in most
families: women do all work inside
the home such as cooking, cleaning,
washing clothes, tailoring, looking
after children, etc., and men do all
the work outside the home. It is not
that men cannot do housework; they
simply think that it is for women to
attend to these things. When these
jobs are paid for, men are ready to
take up these works. Most tailors or
cooks in hotels are men. Similarly,
it is not that women do not work
outside their home. In villages,
women fetch water, collect fuel and
work in the fields. In urban areas,
poor women work as domestic
helper in middle class homes, while
middle class women work in offices.
In fact, the majority of women do
some sort of paid work in addition
to domestic labour. But their work
is not valued and does not get
recognition.
The result of this division of
labour is that although women
constitute half of the humanity, their
role in public life, especially politics,
is minimal in most societies. Earlier,
only men were allowed to participate
in public affairs, vote and contest
for public offices. Gradually the
gender issue was raised in politics.
Women in different parts of the
world organised and agitated for
equal rights. There were agitations
in different countries for the
extension of voting rights to women.

family life as well. These movements
are called feminist movements.

a lot of direct income generating work, but the bulk of their work
is household related. This work remains unpaid and invisible.

prefer to have sons and find ways to

world (see the graph below). India
is behind the averages for several
developing countries of Africa and
Latin America. In the government,
cabinets are largely all-male even
when a woman becomes the Chief
Minister or the Prime Minister.
One way to solve this problem is
to make it legally binding to have a fair
proportion of women in the elected
bodies. This is what the Panchayati
Raj has done in India. One-third of
seats in local government bodies – in
panchayats and municipalities – are
now reserved for women. Now there
are more than 10 lakh elected women
representatives in rural and urban
local bodies.

Gender division is an example
that some form of social division
needs to be expressed in politics. This
also shows that disadvantaged groups
do benefit when social divisions
become a political issue. Do you
think that women could have made
the gains we noted above if their
unequal treatment was not raised in
the political domain?

Women’s organizations and

before the Parliament for many
decades. In 2023, Nari shakti Vandan

Religion, communalism and politics
Let us now turn to a very different
kind of social division, the division
based on religious differences.
This division is not as universal
as gender, but religious diversity
is fairly widespread in the world
today. Many countries including
India have in their population,
followers of different religions. As
we noticed in the case of Northern
Ireland, even when most of the
people belong to the same religion,
there can be serious differences
about the way people practice that
religion. Unlike gender differences,
the religious differences are often
expressed in the field of politics.

and politics. But they do not
seem very wrong or dangerous.
Ideas, ideals and values drawn
from different religions can and
perhaps should play a role in
politics. People should be able
to express in politics their needs,
interests and demands as a member
of a religious community. Those
who hold political power should
sometimes be able to regulate the
practice of religion so as to prevent
discrimination and oppression.
These political acts are not wrong
as long as they treat every religion
equally.

Consider the following:

The problem begins when religion
is seen as the basis of the nation.
The example of Northern Ireland
in Chapter 3 shows the dangers of
such an approach to nationalism.
The problem becomes more acute
when religion is expressed in
politics in exclusive and partisan
terms, when one religion and
its followers are pitted against
another. This happens when beliefs
of one religion are presented as
superior to those of other religions,
when the demands of one religious
group are formed in opposition to
another and when state power is
used to establish domination of one
religious group over the rest. This
manner of using religion in politics
is communal politics.

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

 Gandhiji used to say that
religion can never be separated
from politics. What he meant by
religion was not any particular
religion like Hinduism or Islam
but moral values that inform all
religions. He believed that politics
must be guided by ethics drawn
from religion.
 Human rights groups in our
country have demanded that the
Government should take special
steps to prevent communal riots
and protect religious minorities.

I am not
religious.
Why should I
bother about
communalism
and secularism?

 Women’s movement has argued
that family laws of all religions
discriminate against women.
So they have demanded that
government should change these
laws to make them more equitable.
All these instances involve
a relationship between religion

Communalism

Communal politics is based
on the idea that religion is the
principal basis of social community.
Communalism involves thinking

36
Reprint 2025-26
Chapter 3.indd 36

02/04/2024 11:58:46

This belief is fundamentally
flawed. People of one religion
do not have the same interests
and aspirations in every context.
Everyone has several other roles,
positions and identities. There
are many voices inside every
community. All these voices have
a right to be heard. Therefore any
attempt to bring all followers of one
religion together in context other
than religion is bound to suppress
many voices within that community.
Communalism can take various
forms in politics:
 The most common expression
of communalism is in everyday
beliefs. These routinely involve
religious prejudices, stereotypes of
religious communities and belief in
the superiority of one’s religion over
other religions. This is so common

that we often fail to notice it, even
when we believe in it.
 A communal mind often leads to a
quest for political dominance of one’s
own religious community. For those
belonging to majority community,
this takes the form of majoritarian
dominance. For those belonging
to the minority community, it can
take the form of a desire to form a
separate political unit.

I often crack
jokes about
people from one
religion. Does
that make me
communal?

 Political mobilisation on
religious lines is another frequent
form of communalism. This involves
the use of sacred symbols, religious
leaders, emotional appeal and plain
fear in order to bring the followers
of one religion together in the
political arena. In electoral politics,
this often involves special appeal to
the interests or emotions of voters of
one religion in preference to others.
 Sometimes communalism takes
its most ugly form of communal
violence, riots and massacre. India
and Pakistan suffered some of the
worst communal riots at the time of
the Partition. The post-Independence
period has also seen large scale
communal violence.

Secular state
Communalism was and continues
to be one of the major challenges
to democracy in our country. The
makers of our Constitution were
aware of this challenge. That is why,
they chose the model of a secular
state. This choice was reflected in
several constitutional provisions that
we studied last year:
 There is no official religion for
the Indian state. Unlike the status of
Buddhism in Sri Lanka, that of Islam

Family laws: Those
laws that deal with
family related matters
such as marriage,
divorce, adoption,
inheritance, etc.
In our country,
different family laws
apply to followers of
different religions.

Gender, Religion and Caste

along the following lines. The
followers of a particular religion
must belong to one community.
Their fundamental interests are
the same. Any difference that they
may have is irrelevant or trivial
for community life. It also follows
that people who follow different
religions cannot belong to the same
social community. If the followers
of different religions have some
commonalities these are superficial
and immaterial, their interests are
bound to be different and involve
a conflict. In its extreme form,
communalism leads to the belief
that people belonging to different
religions cannot live as equal citizens
within one nation. Either, one of
them has to dominate the rest or
they have to form different nations.

in Pakistan and that of Christianity in
England, our Constitution does not
give a special status to any religion.
 The Constitution provides to
all individuals and communities
freedom to profess, practice and
propagate any religion, or not to
follow any.
 The Constitution prohibits
discrimination on grounds of
religion.

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

 At the same time, the Constitution
allows the state to intervene in
the matters of religion in order to
ensure equality within religious
communities. For example, it bans
untouchability.
Understood in this sense,
secularism is not just an ideology of
some parties or persons. This idea
constitutes one of the foundations
of our country. Communalism
should not be seen as a threat to
some people in India. It threatens
the very idea of India. That is why
communalism needs to be combated.
A secular Constitution like ours
is necessary but not sufficient to
combat communalism. Communal
prejudices and propaganda need to
be countered in everyday life and
religion- based mobilisation needs to
be countered in the arena of politics.

Caste and politics
We have seen two instances of the
expression of social divisions in the
arena of politics, one largely positive
and the other largely negative. Let us
turn to our final case, that of caste
and politics, that has both positive
and the negative aspects.

Caste inequalities
Unlike gender and religion, caste
division is special to India. All societies
have some kind of social inequality
and some form of division of labour.
In most societies, occupations are
passed on from one generation to
another. Caste system is an extreme
form of this. What makes it different
from other societies is that in this
system, hereditary occupational
division was sanctioned by rituals.
Members of the same caste group
were supposed to form a social
community that practiced the same
or similar occupation, married
within the caste group and did
not eat with members from other
caste groups.
Caste system was based on
exclusion of and discrimination
against the ‘outcaste’ groups. They
were subjected to the inhuman
practice of untouchability about
which you have studied in Class
IX. That is why political leaders
and social reformers like Jotiba
Phule, Gandhiji, B.R. Ambedkar
and Periyar Ramaswami Naicker
advocated and worked to establish
a society in which caste inequalities
are absent.
Partly due to their efforts and
partly due to other socio-economic
changes, castes and caste system
in modern India have undergone
great changes. With economic
development, large scale
urbanisation, growth of literacy and
education, occupational mobility
and the weakening of the position
of landlords in the villages, the old
notions of caste hierarchy are
breaking down. Now, most of the

Social and Religious Diversity of India

The same is true of the major caste groups. The Census of India counts two social
groups: the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Both these broad groups
include hundreds of castes or tribes whose names are listed in an official Schedule.
Hence the prefix ‘Scheduled’ in their name. The Scheduled Castes, commonly known
as Dalits, include those that were previously regarded as ‘outcaste’ in the Hindu social
order and were subjected to exclusion and untouchability. The Scheduled Tribes, often
referred to as Adivasis, include those communities that led a secluded life usually in hills
and forests and did not interact much with the rest of society. In 2011, the Scheduled
Castes were 16.6 per cent and the
Scheduled Tribes were 8.6 per cent

communities in India, 2011
The Census does not yet count the
Other Backward Classes, the group
we discussed in Class IX. Hence there
are some differences about their
proportion in the country’s population.
The National Sample Survey of
2004–05 estimates their population
to be around 41 per cent. Thus the
SC, ST and the OBC together account
for about two-thirds of the country’s
population and about three-fourths of
the Hindu population.

The Census of India records the religion of each and every Indian after every ten years.
The person who fills the Census form visits every household and records the religion of
each member of that household exactly the way each person describes it. If someone
says she has ‘no religion’ or that he is an ‘atheist’, this is exactly how it is recorded.
Thus we have reliable information on the proportion of different religious communities
in the country and how it has changed over the years. The pie chart below presents
the population proportion of six major religious communities in the country. Since
Independence, the total population of each community has increased substantially but
their proportion in the country’s population has not changed much. In percentage terms,
the population of the Hindus, Jains and Christians has declined marginally since 1961.
The proportion of Muslim, Sikh and Buddhist population has increased slightly. There is
a common but mistaken impression that the proportion of the Muslims in the country’s
population is going to overtake other religious communities. Expert estimates done for
the Prime Minister’s High Level Committee (popularly known as Sachar Committee)
show that the proportion of the Muslims is expected to go up a little, by about 3 to 4
per cent, in the next 50 years. It proves that in overall terms, the population balance
of different religious communities is not likely to change in a big way.

times, in urban areas it does not
matter much who is walking along
next to us on a street or eating at
the next table in a restaurant. The
Constitution of India prohibited any
caste-based discrimination and laid
the foundations of policies to reverse
the injustices of the caste system. If
a person who lived a century ago
were to return to India, she would
be greatly surprised at the change
that has come about in the country.
Yet caste has not disappeared
from contemporary India. Some
of the older aspects of caste have
persisted. Even now most people
marry within their own caste or
tribe. Untouchability has not ended
completely, despite constitutional
prohibition. Effects of centuries
of advantages and disadvantages
continue to be felt today. The caste
groups that had access to education
under the old system have done very
well in acquiring modern education
as well. Those groups that did not
have access to education or were
prohibited from acquiring it have

naturally lagged behind. That is why
there is a disproportionately large
presence of ‘upper caste’ among
the urban middle classes in our
country. Caste continues to be
closely linked to economic status.
(See Plus Box on Page 41.)

Caste in politics
As in the case of communalism,
casteism is rooted in the belief
that caste is the sole basis of social
community. According to this way
of thinking, people belonging to
the same caste belong to a natural
social community and have the
same interests which they do not
share with anyone from another
caste. As we saw in the case of
communalism, such a belief is not
borne out by our experience. Caste
is one aspect of our experience but it
is not the only relevant or the most
important aspect.
Caste can take various forms
in politics:
 When parties choose candidates
in elections, they keep in mind the
caste composition of the electorate
and nominate candidates from
different castes so as to muster
necessary support to win elections.
When governments are formed,
political parties usually take care that
representatives of different castes and
tribes find a place in it.
 Political parties and candidates
in elections make appeals to caste
sentiment to muster support. Some
political parties are known to favour
some castes and are seen as their
representatives.
 Universal adult franchise and
the principle of one-person-one-vote

Caste inequality today
Caste is an important source of economic inequality because it regulates
access to resources of various kinds. For example, in the past, the so-called
‘untouchable’ castes were denied the right to own land, while only the so-called
‘twice born’ castes had the right to education. Although this kind of explicit and
formalised inequality based on caste is now outlawed, the effects of centuries of
accumulated advantages and disadvantages continue to be felt. Moreover, new
kinds of inequalities have also developed.
The relationship between caste and economic status has certainly changed a
lot. Today, it is possible to find very rich and very poor people in every caste,
whether ‘low’ or ‘high’. This was not true even twenty or thirty years ago – it
was very rare indeed to find rich people among the ‘lowest’ castes. However,
as this evidence from the National Sample Survey shows, caste continues to be
very strongly linked to economic status in many important ways:
 The average economic status (measured by criteria like monthly
consumption expenditure) of caste groups still follows the old hierarchy –
the ‘upper’ castes are best off, the Dalits and Adivasis are worst off, and the
backward classes are in between.
 Although every caste has some poor members, the proportion living in
extreme poverty (below the official ‘poverty line’) is much higher for the lowest
castes and much lower for the upper castes, with the backward classes once
again in between.
 Although every caste has some members who are rich, the upper castes are
heavily over-represented among the rich while the lower castes are severely
under-represented.

compelled political leaders to gear up
to the task of mobilising and securing
political support. It also brought new
consciousness among the people of
castes that were hitherto treated as
inferior and low.
The focus on caste in politics
can sometimes give an impression
that elections are all about caste and
nothing else. That is far from true.
Just consider these:
 No parliamentary constituency
in the country has a clear majority
of one single caste. So, every
candidate and party needs to win the
confidence of more than one caste
and community to win elections.

 No party wins the votes of all
the voters of a caste or community.
When people say that a caste is a
‘vote bank’ of one party, it usually
means that a large proportion of

the voters from that caste vote for
that party.
 Many political parties may put
up candidates from the same caste
(if that caste is believed to dominate
the electorate in a particular
constituency). Some voters have
more than one candidate from their
caste while many voters have no
candidate from their caste.
 The ruling party and the sitting
MP or MLA frequently lose elections
in our country. That could not
have happened if all castes and
communities were frozen in their
political preferences.
Clearly, while caste matters in
electoral politics, so do many other
factors. The voters have strong
attachment to political parties which
is often stronger than their attachment
to their caste or community. People
within the same caste or community
have different interests depending
on their economic condition. Rich
and poor or men and women from
the same caste often vote very
differently. People’s assessment of
the performance of the government
and the popularity rating of the
leaders matter and are often decisive
in elections.

Politics in caste

Do you think that political leaders are right to treat people belonging to a
caste as ‘vote banks’?

We have so far looked at what caste
does to politics. But it does not mean
that there is only a one-way relation
between caste and politics. Politics
too influences the caste system and
caste identities by bringing them
into the political arena. Thus, it is
not politics that gets caste-ridden, it

is the caste that gets politicised. This
takes several forms:
 Each caste group tries to become
bigger by incorporating within it
neighbouring castes or sub-castes
which were earlier excluded from it.
 Various caste groups are required
to enter into a coalition with other
castes or communities and thus enter
into a dialogue and negotiation.
 New kinds of caste groups
have come up in the political arena
like ‘backward’ and ‘forward’
caste groups.

At the same time, exclusive
attention to caste can produce
negative results as well. As in the
case of religion, politics based on
caste identity alone is not very
healthy in a democracy. It can
divert attention from other pressing
issues like poverty, development
and corruption. In some cases, caste
division leads to tensions, conflict
and even violence.

Gender, Religion and Caste

Thus, caste plays different
kinds of roles in politics. In some
situations, expression of caste
differences in politics gives many
disadvantaged communities the
space to demand their share of

power. In this sense, caste politics
has helped people from Dalits and
OBC castes to gain better access to
decision making. Several political
and non-political organisations have
been demanding and agitating for
an end to discrimination against
particular castes, for more dignity
and more access to land, resources
and opportunities.
