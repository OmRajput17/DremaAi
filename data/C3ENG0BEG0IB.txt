Making Questions from Statements
Read these sentences.

Is this my cat? (question)
You are hungry. (statement)

To change a statement to a question, we place the verb at the beginning of the sentence. In
other words, we exchange the places of the noun or pronoun and the verb.
Examples: Brazil is the largest country in South America.
Is Brazil the largest country in South America? (noun: Brazil, verb: is)
Zootopia is a children's film.

6. The ships are in the harbour.
7. The magician is doing magic tricks.
8. Tia is reading a story.
9. They are planning a trip.
10. This story is funny.

question. These words are always followed by the verb.
Examples: Who is the author of this book?
Why were you absent yesterday?
When will she come back?
What are you having for lunch?
Where is my bag?
How are you today?
Rearrange the words to make questions. Remember to add a question mark.

3. seashells the who from seashore collected
4. is the where beach
5. go how to you school do

Adjectives: Degrees
of Comparison
Read these sentences.
Gerry is tall.
Edward is taller than Gerry.
Henry is the tallest of them all.
The second sentence compares the heights of Edward
and Gerry, using the adjective taller. The third sentence
compares the heights of Edward, Gerry and Henry, using
the adjective tallest. Both adjectives come from the usual
form of the adjective, tall.
We can compare two or more things using adjectives. An
adjective can have three forms depending on how many things we compare.
The first and usual form is used when we simply describe something or someone.
Examples: The baby is happy.
The giraffe has a long neck.
The second form is used when we compare two things.
Examples: Apurva looks happier than Anuj.
(The happiness of two boys, Apurva and Anuj, are being compared.)
The giraffe's neck is longer than the lion's neck.
(The necks of two animals, the giraffe and the lion, are being compared.)
In the third form of adjectives, we compare more than two things.
Examples: Praveen is the happiest person I know.
This road is the longest in India.
Rules for Comparing Adjectives
1. To compare two things, we add -er to the adjective.
Examples: high → higher, smooth smoother, cool→ cooler
2. To compare more than two things, we add -est to the adjective.
Examples: short shortest, small smallest
41b
42
3. For some adjectives, we add more or less before
the adjective instead of adding -er.
Examples: beautiful → more beautiful
exciting → less exciting
4. For some adjectives, we add most or least before
the adjective instead of adding -est.
Examples: dangerous → most dangerous
interesting → least interesting
5. Some adjectives do not follow any of these.
patterns. Their other forms are completely
different from their usual forms.
Examples: good better best
bad worse worst

The Magic Window
Read the story.
Once, there was a little boy called Thomas who
became very ill and had to spend all day in bed.
He spent most of his day feeling sad, because
other children were not allowed to come near
him.
There wasn't much Thomas could do except look
out of the window of his ground-floor bedroom.
One day, he wished with all his heart that he
could
go out and play with his friends. Suddenly,
he saw a strange shape in the window. It was a
penguin eating a sandwich.
Thomas was very surprised. Was he dreaming?
When he blinked and looked the next moment,
there was a monkey in a nappy, busy blowing up a balloon. At first, Thomas was too surprised to
move, but after a while, he burst out laughing.
The next day, Thomas looked out again. 'Will it happen again?" he thought.
He didn't have to wait long. Slowly, there rose a cow playing a tambourine, an elephant jumping
on a trampoline and a dog wearing a pair of glasses. Thomas didn't tell anyone at home about
the things he saw because nobody would have believed him.
Before long. Thomas got better and was able to go back to school again. He could not wait to
tell his friends about the strange things he had seen. While talking to his best friend, Pam, he
noticed something sticking out of her school bag.
"What is it?" he asked.
'Oh, it's nothing," Pam said. But she kept smiling, as if it was something. Then, she showed him.
Inside her bag were all the suits and costumes that she had been using to cheer him up!
'I could not come and visit you, so I thought I would make you laugh!" she said.

The Story of the Moon
Read the story.
When the world was just created, there was no
Moon in the sky. The Sun shone fiercely and there
was always daylight. People worked all the time.
They did not know when to rest or sleep.
One day, the Creator - the one who made
everything-visited the people working in the fields.
He asked them, "When did you last water this field?"
'Today,' replied a farmer.
'When did you plant those trees in the garden?"
'Today. It is day all the time. So, everything was done today."
The Creator realised that people worked all the time as there was no difference between day and
night.
He told the Sun, You must shine all day, set in the evening and rise again the next moming."
In the evening that day, the Sun went down quietly. Suddenly, everything became dark. People
had never been without light before. They ran here and there in fear. Some stepped on each
other, some fell into ditches and hurt themselves.
Finally, the leaders of the people announced, "We must rest now, for we cannot see anything in
this darkness.
At daybreak, everyone woke up and started working again. From then on, the day became
the time for work and the night was the time for rest. But after sunset, people kept hurting
themselves moving around in the darkness.
After a few days, the Creator returned and asked the people, 'Are you happy now?"
"Yes, we are,' they said, 'But we often hurt each other and break things in the dark."
The Creator thought for some time and replied, 'Don't worry. I shall give you something
comforting for the night. You will be able to see things and still sleep peacefully."

'Now, the people are finally happy,' He said with a satisfied smile and went home to sleep.

Clever Tenali
Read the story.
Tenali Raman was a
famous jester in the court
of King Krishna Devaraya
of Vijaynagara. Sometimes,
the king got angry at Tenali
because of his foolish
behaviour. But soon, Tenali
would make him laugh with
his jokes. The king was very
fond of him.
One day, a famous
magician from the north
came to visit Vijaynagara.
He turned pebbles into
gold, created perfumes out
of nothing and could do
even the most difficult tricks. Krishna Devaraya praised him a lot. Then the magician said, 'I'm
the best. There is no one who is better than me. If anyone can defeat me, I will give up my life."
After the magician left, Krishna Devaraya became quiet. Then, he went to Tenali and said, "Can
you defeat the magician?" Tenali said yes.
The same day, he found the magician and told him, 'You can't do with your eyes open what I
can easily do with my eyes shut.' The magician got very angry. He said that he could do it much
better than Tenali. If he failed, then he would give up his life.
Both of them reached the king's court. Tenali took out a box of chilli powder. He shut his eyes
tightly and put chilli powder on both his eyelids. He waited like this for a minute and removed
the powder. Then he told the magician to do the same with his eyes open.
The magician thought and thought, but could not find a way to do it. At last, he said, 'I give
up. You defeated me. My head is yours."
Krishna Devaraya was happy now and let the magician go. He also gave Tenali gold coins for
his cleverness.

neighbourhood. The wife
felt sad to see other children

parents a lot of joy. They let her do whatever she wanted. But the wife warned her, "You can do
what you want, go where you want, dear daughter. Only remember, fire is your greatest enemy.
Never go near the fire."
Louisa obeyed the couple and never went near the fire.
All went well for a few months. Louisa made friends with the other children. She joined them in
all their games. One day, the children made a bonfire and began to dance around it. Louisa did

Cornelia's Jewels
104
Read the story.
Long ago, two brothers lived in the ancient
city of Rome with their mother, Cornelia.
One day, standing outside their front door,
they looked out at her walking in the garden
with her friend.
'Have you ever seen someone as beautiful as
our mother's friend?" asked the younger boy.
"She looks like a queen."
*But the lady is not as beautiful as our
mother," disagreed the elder boy.
Soon, Comelia entered the house. She was the daughter of a famous general, but she often wore
a plain, white robe. She wore no jewellery, unlike her friend, who had many gold chains and
precious rings on her fingers. Cornelia wore her soft brown hair in long braids. She had a warm
smile on her lips.
*Boys, let us have dinner. Then, my friend will show us her box of jewels,' Cornelia said. The
brothers obediently agreed.
When the simple meal was over, a helper brought the box to the dinner table. The jewels dazzled
the boys. There were ropes of pearls as white as milk, heaps of red rubies, sapphires as blue as the
sky and diamonds that sparkled like sunlight.
"If only our mother could have such beautiful things!" whispered the younger brother.
'Is it true, Cornelia, that you have no jewels and are poor?"
'No, I am not poor,' answered Comelia. As she spoke, she drew her sons to her side. 'Here are my
jewels. They are worth more than all your gems.
The boys never forgot their mother's pride in them. They grew up to be powerful men who helped
the poor. Across the Roman kingdom, everyone knew them as 'Cornelia's jewels'.

they did not have enough food
to eat. One evening, they had
only two buns and some milk for
dinner. They decided to divide it

then, someone knocked on the
door.
A tall stranger stood at the door.
'I have not eaten anything for two
days. Please give me something to
eat,' he said in a tired voice.
The old man and his wife welcomed him inside, and gave him the two buns and milk. 'We are
sorry, but this is all we have,' they said.
The traveller gladly ate the food and thanked the couple warmly. Before leaving, he gave them
a wooden box as a gift. The old man opened the box and to his surprise, he found a gold coin
inside. He showed it to his wife. They sold the coin and bought food for themselves.
Next morning, they opened the box again. Lo and behold! There was another gold coin in the
box. They couldn't believe their eyes.

Nasruddin and the
Smell of Soup
110
Read the story.
In the city of Baghdad on a cold winter's day, an old
beggar got a piece of bread from a kind woman. He was
grateful, for he had not eaten in two days. But the bread
was dry. Without anything to put on it, it was hard to
chew.
Hoping to get something to go with his bread, the
beggar went to a nearby inn and said to the innkeeper,
'Kind sir, could I have a bit of soup to wet my bread in?"
'Off with you!" the innkeeper cried. 'I don't have time for
penniless people."
But the beggar was so hungry that he stole into the kitchen. A large pot of soup was cooking
over the fire. He held the bread over the pot and tried to catch a little flavour from the delicious-
smelling air that rose from it.
Suddenly, the innkeeper caught him by the arm.
'How dare you steal my soup!" he cried.
'I took no soup,' said the beggar. 'I was only smelling it."
'Then you must pay for the smell,' said the innkeeper. He dragged him before Nasruddin
Hodja, who was the judge in those days. He heard the innkeeper's complaint and the beggar's
explanation.
'So you want payment for the smell of your soup?" Nasruddin asked.
"Yes!' answered the innkeeper.
'Then I will pay you myself," Nasruddin replied. 'Come closer."
The greedy innkeeper came near, thinking how easily he had tricked Nasruddin.
Nasruddin drew two coins from his pocket and jingled them loudly near the man's ear.
"What is this?' the innkeeper cried in surprise.
I am paying for the smell of your soup with the sound of money. Now take that and go home."
The innkeeper realised that he had been outwitted.
'Take these coins, my man, Nasruddin told the beggar, 'and buy yourself some soup.'

The Last Green Lung
of Mumbai
Read the passage.
The city of Mumbai is home to the forest of
Aarey. Some people call it the last green lung
of Mumbai. On 5 October 2019, workers
started cutting trees in the Aarey forest. They
had got permission from the courts to chop
up to 2500 trees to build a car shed for the
Mumbai Metro. Many people of Mumbai
spoke up against these actions. They were
common people, scientists, people who fight
to protect the environment and even film
stars. Later that same month, the Supreme
Court of India ordered that no more trees
would be cut in Aarey.
-
Aarey Forest, beside the Aarey Milk Colony and the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, is home to
about 290 species of wildlife. It has animals like the leopard, deer, mongoose and the jackal,
birds like the hoopoe and the Grey Hornbill. There are 76 types of birds and more than 80 types
of butterflies here! Two new types of jumping spiders and tarantulas
a type
of large, hairy
spider were discovered in the forest. Two types of trapdoor spiders and tarantulas, which
people thought had died out, were also rediscovered. If the forest is cut down, these creatures
will all lose their homes, as will the many tribal people who have lived here for generations.
Trees absorb harmful gases in the air and bring down pollution. For Mumbai, one of the most
polluted cities in India, the forest is like a natural air purifier. Just as human beings need healthy
lungs to breathe, cities need trees so that its people can breathe clean air.
