Revolution
Chapter I is on the French Revolution. Today we often take the ideas of liberty,
freedom and equality for granted. But we need to remind ourselves that these ideas
also have a history. By looking at the French Revolution you will read a small part
of that history. The French Revolution led to the end of monarchy in France. A
society based on privileges gave way to a new system of governance. The Declaration
of the Rights of Man during the revolution, announced the coming of a new time.
The idea that all individuals had rights and could claim equality became part of a
new language of politics. These notions of equality and freedom emerged as the central
ideas of a new age; but in different countries they were reinterpreted and rethought
in many different ways. The anti-colonial movements in India and China, Africa and
South America, produced ideas that were innovative and original, but they spoke in
a language that gained currency only from the late eighteenth century.

In Chapter II, you will read about the coming of socialism in Europe, and the dramatic
events that forced the ruling monarch, Tsar Nicholas II, to give up power. The Russian
Revolution sought to change society in a different way. It raised the question of
economic equality and the well-being of workers and peasants. The chapter will tell
you about the changes that were initiated by the new Soviet government, the problems
it faced and the measures it undertook. While Soviet Russia pushed ahead with
industrialisation and mechanisation of agriculture, it denied the rights of citizens
that were essential to the working of a democratic society. The ideals of socialism,

the Soviet Union has broken up and socialism is in crisis but through the twentieth
century it has been a powerful force in the shaping of the contemporary world.
Chapter III will take you to Germany. It will discuss the rise of Hitler and the
politics of Nazism. You will read about the children and women in Nazi Germany,
about schools and concentration camps. You will see how Nazism denied various
minorities a right to live, how it drew upon a long tradition of anti-Jewish feelings
to persecute the Jews, and how it waged a relentless battle against democracy and
socialism. But the story of Nazism’s rise is not only about a few specific events,
about massacres and killings. It is about the working of an elaborate and frightening
system which operated at different levels. Some in India were impressed with the
ideas of Hitler but most watched the rise of Nazism with horror.

The history of the modern world is not simply a story of the unfolding of freedom
and democracy. It has also been a story of violence and tyranny, death and destruction.

Chapter I
The French Revolution
On the morning of 14 July 1789, the city of Paris was in a state of
alarm. The king had commanded troops to move into the city. Rumours
spread that he would soon order the army to open fire upon the citizens.
Some 7,000 men and women gathered in front of the town hall and
decided to form a peoples’ militia. They broke into a number of
government buildings in search of arms.

R e v o l u t i o n
Finally, a group of several hundred people marched towards the eastern
part of the city and stormed the fortress-prison, the Bastille, where they
hoped to find hoarded ammunition. In the armed fight that followed,
the commander of the Bastille was killed and the prisoners released –
though there were only seven of them. Yet the Bastille was hated by all,
because it stood for the despotic power of the king. The fortress was
demolished and its stone fragments were sold in the markets to all
those who wished to keep a souvenir of its destruction.

The days that followed saw more rioting both in Paris and the
countryside. Most people were protesting against the high price of bread.
Much later, when historians looked back upon this time, they saw it as
the beginning of a chain of events that ultimately led to the execution
of the king in France, though most people at the time did not anticipate
this outcome. How and why did this happen?

1 French Society During the Late Eighteenth Century
In 1774, Louis XVI of the Bourbon family of kings ascended the
throne of France. He was 20 years old and married to the Austrian
princess Marie Antoinette. Upon his accession the new king found
an empty treasury. Long years of war had drained the financial
resources of France. Added to this was the cost of maintaining an
extravagant court at the immense palace of Versailles. Under Louis
XVI, France helped the thirteen American colonies to gain their
independence from the common enemy, Britain. The war added more
than a billion livres to a debt that had already risen to more than 2
billion livres. Lenders who gave the state credit, now began to charge
10 per cent interest on loans. So the French government was obliged
to spend an increasing percentage of its budget on interest payments
alone. To meet its regular expenses, such as the cost of maintaining
an army, the court, running government offices or universities, the
state was forced to increase taxes. Yet even this measure would not
have sufficed. French society in the eighteenth century was divided
into three estates, and only members of the third estate paid taxes.

India and the Contemporary World
The society of estates was part of the feudal system that dated back to
the middle ages. The term Old Regime is usually used to describe the
society and institutions of France before 1789.
Fig. 2 shows how the system of estates in French society was organised.
Peasants made up about 90 per cent of the population. However,
only a small number of them owned the land they cultivated. About
60 per cent of the land was owned by nobles, the Church and other
richer members of the third estate. The members of the first two
estates, that is, the clergy and the nobility, enjoyed certain privileges by
birth. The most important of these was exemption from paying taxes to
the state. The nobles further enjoyed feudal privileges. These included
feudal dues, which they extracted from the peasants. Peasants were obliged
to render services to the lord – to work in his house and fields – to serve
in the army or to participate in building roads.
The Church too extracted its share of taxes called tithes from the peasants,
and finally, all members of the third estate had to pay taxes to the state.
These included a direct tax, called taille, and a number of indirect taxes
which were levied on articles of everyday consumption like salt or tobacco.
The burden of financing activities of the state through taxes was borne
by the third estate alone.

The population of France rose from about 23 million in 1715 to 28
million in 1789. This led to a rapid increase in the demand for
foodgrains. Production of grains could not keep pace with the
demand. So the price of bread which was the staple diet of the majority
rose rapidly. Most workers were employed as labourers in workshops
whose owner fixed their wages. But wages did not keep pace with
the rise in prices. So the gap between the poor and the rich widened.
Things became worse whenever drought or hail reduced the harvest.
This led to a subsistence crisis, something that occurred frequently
in France during the Old Regime.

1.3 A Growing Middle Class Envisages an End to Privileges
India and the Contemporary World
In the past, peasants and workers had participated in revolts against
increasing taxes and food scarcity. But they lacked the means and
programmes to carry out full-scale measures that would bring about
a change in the social and economic order. This was left to those
groups within the third estate who had become prosperous and had
access to education and new ideas.
The eighteenth century witnessed the emergence of social groups,
termed the middle class, who earned their wealth through an
expanding overseas trade and from the manufacture of goods such as
woollen and silk textiles that were either exported or bought by the
richer members of society. In addition to merchants and
manufacturers, the third estate included professions such as lawyers
or administrative officials. All of these were educated and believed
that no group in society should be privileged by birth. Rather, a
person’s social position must depend on his merit. These ideas
envisaging a society based on freedom and equal laws and
opportunities for all, were put forward by philosophers such as John
Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau. In his Two Treatises of Government,
Locke sought to refute the doctrine of the divine and absolute right

of the monarch. Rousseau carried the idea forward, proposing a
form of government based on a social contract between people
and their representatives. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu
proposed a division of power within the government between
the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. This model of
government was put into force in the USA, after the thirteen
colonies declared their independence from Britain. The American
constitution and its guarantee of individual rights was an important
example for political thinkers in France.
The ideas of these philosophers were discussed intensively in salons
and coffee-houses and spread among people through books and
newspapers. These were frequently read aloud in groups for the
benefit of those who could not read and write. The news that
Louis XVI planned to impose further taxes to be able to meet the
expenses of the state generated anger and protest against the system
of privileges.

Accounts of lived experiences in the Old Regime
1. Georges Danton, who later became active in revolutionary politics, wrote to a friend in
1793, looking back upon the time when he had just completed his studies:
‘I was educated in the residential college of Plessis. There I was in the company of
important men … Once my studies ended, I was left with nothing. I started looking for a
post. It was impossible to find one at the law courts in Paris. The choice of a career in the
army was not open to me as I was not a noble by birth, nor did I have a patron. The
church too could not offer me a refuge. I could not buy an office as I did not possess a
sou. My old friends turned their backs to me … the system had provided us with an
education without however offering a field where our talents could be utilised.’

2 The Outbreak of the Revolution
Louis XVI had to increase taxes for reasons you have learnt in the
previous section. How do you think he could have gone about doing
this? In France of the Old Regime the monarch did not have the
power to impose taxes according to his will alone. Rather he had to
call a meeting of the Estates General which would then pass his
proposals for new taxes. The Estates General was a political body to
which the three estates sent their representatives. However, the
monarch alone could decide when to call a meeting of this body. The
last time it was done was in 1614.

India and the Contemporary World
On 5 May 1789, Louis XVI called together an assembly of the Estates
General to pass proposals for new taxes. A resplendent hall in
Versailles was prepared to host the delegates. The first and second
estates sent 300 representatives each, who were seated in rows facing
each other on two sides, while the 600 members of the third estate
had to stand at the back. The third estate was represented by its more
prosperous and educated members. Peasants, artisans and women
were denied entry to the assembly. However, their grievances and
demands were listed in some 40,000 letters which the representatives
had brought with them.
Voting in the Estates General in the past had been conducted according
to the principle that each estate had one vote. This time too Louis
XVI was determined to continue the same practice. But members of
the third estate demanded that voting now be conducted by the
assembly as a whole, where each member would have one vote. This
was one of the democratic principles put forward by philosophers
like Rousseau in his book The Social Contract. When the king rejected
this proposal, members of the third estate walked out of the assembly
in protest.
The representatives of the third estate viewed themselves as spokesmen
for the whole French nation. On 20 June they assembled in the hall
of an indoor tennis court in the grounds of Versailles. They declared
themselves a National Assembly and swore not to disperse till they
had drafted a constitution for France that would limit the powers of
the monarch. They were led by Mirabeau and Abbé Sieyès. Mirabeau
was born in a noble family but was convinced of the need to do away
with a society of feudal privilege. He brought out a journal and
delivered powerful speeches to the crowds assembled at Versailles.

Faced with the power of his revolting subjects, Louis XVI finally

decree abolishing the feudal system of obligations and taxes. Members
of the clergy too were forced to give up their privileges. Tithes were
abolished and lands owned by the Church were confiscated. As a
result, the government acquired assets worth at least 2 billion livres.

The National Assembly completed the draft of the constitution in

powers instead of being concentrated in the hands of one person,
were now separated and assigned to different institutions – the
legislature, executive and judiciary. This made France a constitutional
monarchy. Fig. 7 explains how the new political system worked.

The Constitution of 1791 vested the power to make laws in the
National Assembly, which was indirectly elected. That is, citizens
voted for a group of electors, who in turn chose the Assembly. Not
all citizens, however, had the right to vote. Only men above 25 years
of age who paid taxes equal to at least 3 days of a labourer’s wage
were given the status of active citizens, that is, they were entitled to
vote. The remaining men and all women were classed as passive
citizens. To qualify as an elector and then as a member of the Assembly,
a man had to belong to the highest bracket of taxpayers.

3 France Abolishes Monarchy and Becomes a Republic
The situation in France continued to be tense during the following years.
Although Louis XVI had signed the Constitution, he entered into secret
negotiations with the King of Prussia. Rulers of other neighbouring
countries too were worried by the developments in France and made
plans to send troops to put down the events that had been taking place
there since the summer of 1789. Before this could happen, the National
Assembly voted in April 1792 to declare war against Prussia and Austria.
Thousands of volunteers thronged from the provinces to join the army.
They saw this as a war of the people against kings and aristocracies all
over Europe. Among the patriotic songs they sang was the Marseillaise,
composed by the poet Roget de L’Isle. It was sung for the first time by
volunteers from Marseilles as they marched into Paris and so got its
name. The Marseillaise is now the national anthem of France.

India and the Contemporary World
The revolutionary wars brought losses and economic difficulties
to the people. While the men were away fighting at the front,
women were left to cope with the tasks of earning a living and
looking after their families. Large sections of the population were
convinced that the revolution had to be carried further, as the
Constitution of 1791 gave political rights only to the richer sections
of society. Political clubs became an important rallying point for
people who wished to discuss government policies and plan their
own forms of action. The most successful of these clubs was that of
the Jacobins, which got its name from the former convent of St
Jacob in Paris. Women too, who had been active throughout this
period, formed their own clubs. Section 4 of this chapter will tell
you more about their activities and demands.
The members of the Jacobin club belonged mainly to the less
prosperous sections of society. They included small shopkeepers,
artisans such as shoemakers, pastry cooks, watch-makers, printers,
as well as servants and daily-wage workers. Their leader was
Maximilian Robespierre. A large group among the Jacobins decided
to start wearing long striped trousers similar to those worn by
dock workers. This was to set themselves apart from the fashionable
sections of society, especially nobles, who wore knee breeches. It

the king himself as hostage for several hours. Later the Assembly
voted to imprison the royal family. Elections were held. From now

The newly elected assembly was called the Convention. On

laws, we must first finish the war of liberty
against tyranny …. We must annihilate the
enemies of the republic at home and abroad,
or else we shall perish. In time of Revolution
a democratic government may rely on terror.

Revolution
The fall of the Jacobin government allowed the wealthier middle
classes to seize power. A new constitution was introduced which
denied the vote to non-propertied sections of society. It provided
for two elected legislative councils. These then appointed a Directory,
an executive made up of five members. This was meant as a safeguard
against the concentration of power in a one-man executive as under
the Jacobins. However, the Directors often clashed with the legislative
councils, who then sought to dismiss them. The political instability
of the Directory paved the way for the rise of a military dictator,
Napoleon Bonaparte.

India and the Contemporary World
Fig.12 – Parisian women on their way to Versailles.
This print is one of the many pictorial representations of the events of 5 October 1789, when women marched to Versailles
and brought the king back with them to Paris.

From the very beginning women were active participants in the events
which brought about so many important changes in French society.
They hoped that their involvement would pressurise the revolutionary
government to introduce measures to improve their lives. Most
women of the third estate had to work for a living. They worked as
seamstresses or laundresses, sold flowers, fruits and vegetables at the
market, or were employed as domestic servants in the houses of
prosperous people. Most women did not have access to education or
job training. Only daughters of nobles or wealthier members of the
third estate could study at a convent, after which their families
arranged a marriage for them. Working women had also to care for
their families, that is, cook, fetch water, queue up for bread and
look after the children. Their wages were lower than those of men.
In order to discuss and voice their interests women started their own
political clubs and newspapers. About sixty women’s clubs came up
in different French cities. The Society of Revolutionary and
Republican Women was the most famous of them. One of their

main demands was that women enjoy the same political rights as
men. Women were disappointed that the Constitution of 1791 reduced
them to passive citizens. They demanded the right to vote, to be
elected to the Assembly and to hold political office. Only then, they
felt, would their interests be represented in the new government.
In the early years, the revolutionary government did introduce laws
that helped improve the lives of women. Together with the creation
of state schools, schooling was made compulsory for all girls. Their
fathers could no longer force them into marriage against their will.
Marriage was made into a contract entered into freely and registered
under civil law. Divorce was made legal, and could be applied for by
both women and men. Women could now train for jobs, could
become artists or run small businesses.
Women’s struggle for equal political rights, however, continued.
During the Reign of Terror, the new government issued laws ordering
closure of women’s clubs and banning their political activities. Many
prominent women were arrested and a number of them executed.
Women’s movements for voting rights and equal wages continued
through the next two hundred years in many countries of the world.
The fight for the vote was carried out through an international
suffrage movement during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. The example of the political activities of French women
during the revolutionary years was kept alive as an inspiring memory.
It was finally in 1946 that women in France won the right to vote.

Olympe de Gouges was one of the most important of the politically

Woman and Citizen, which she addressed to the Queen and to the
members of the National Assembly, demanding that they act upon
it. In 1793, Olympe de Gouges criticised the Jacobin government
for forcibly closing down women’s clubs. She was tried by the
National Convention, which charged her with treason. Soon after

5 The Abolition of Slavery
Throughout the eighteenth century there was little criticism of slavery
in France. The National Assembly held long debates about whether
the rights of man should be extended to all French subjects including
those in the colonies. But it did not pass any laws, fearing opposition
from businessmen whose incomes depended on the slave trade. It
was finally the Convention which in 1794 legislated to free all slaves
in the French overseas possessions. This, however, turned out to be
a short-term measure: ten years later, Napoleon reintroduced slavery.
Plantation owners understood their freedom as including the right
to enslave African Negroes in pursuit of their economic interests.
Slavery was finally abolished in French colonies in 1848.

Revolution
One of the most revolutionary social reforms of the Jacobin regime
was the abolition of slavery in the French colonies. The colonies in
the Caribbean – Martinique, Guadeloupe and San Domingo – were
important suppliers of commodities such as tobacco, indigo, sugar
and coffee. But the reluctance of Europeans to go and work in distant
and unfamiliar lands meant a shortage of labour on the plantations.
So this was met by a triangular slave trade between Europe, Africa
and the Americas. The slave trade began in the seventeenth century.
French merchants sailed from the ports of Bordeaux or Nantes to
the African coast, where they bought slaves from local chieftains.
Branded and shackled, the slaves were packed tightly into ships for
the three-month long voyage across the Atlantic to the Caribbean.
There they were sold to plantation owners. The exploitation of slave
labour made it possible to meet the growing demand in European
markets for sugar, coffee, and indigo. Port cities like Bordeaux and
Nantes owed their economic prosperity to the flourishing slave trade.

6 The Revolution and Everyday Life
Can politics change the clothes people wear, the language they speak
or the books they read? The years following 1789 in France saw many
such changes in the lives of men, women and children. The
revolutionary governments took it upon themselves to pass laws that
would translate the ideals of liberty and equality into everyday practice.

India and the Contemporary World
One important law that came into effect soon after the storming of
the Bastille in the summer of 1789 was the abolition of censorship. In
the Old Regime all written material and cultural activities – books,
newspapers, plays – could be published or performed only after they
had been approved by the censors of the king. Now the Declaration
of the Rights of Man and Citizen proclaimed freedom of speech and
expression to be a natural right. Newspapers, pamphlets, books and
printed pictures flooded the towns of France from where they
travelled rapidly into the countryside. They all described and discussed
the events and changes taking place in France. Freedom of the press
also meant that opposing views of events could be expressed. Each
side sought to convince the others of its position through the medium
of print. Plays, songs and festive processions attracted large numbers
of people. This was one way they could grasp and identify with ideas
such as liberty or justice that political philosophers wrote about at
length in texts which only a handful of educated people could read.

Socialism in Europe and
the Russian Revolution
1 The Age of Social Change
Socialism

Europe
Socialism in Europe and
Revolution and the Russian Revolution
In the previous chapter you read about the powerful ideas of freedom
and equality that circulated in Europe after the French Revolution.
The French Revolution opened up the possibility of creating a
dramatic change in the way in which society was structured. As you
have read, before the eighteenth century society was broadly divided
into estates and orders and it was the aristocracy and church which
controlled economic and social power. Suddenly, after the revolution,
it seemed possible to change this. In many parts of the world including
Europe and Asia, new ideas about individual rights and who
controlled social power began to be discussed. In India, Raja
Rammohan Roy and Derozio talked of the significance of the French
Revolution, and many others debated the ideas of post-revolutionary
Europe. The developments in the colonies, in turn, reshaped these
ideas of societal change.
Not everyone in Europe, however, wanted a complete transformation
of society. Responses varied from those who accepted that some
change was necessary but wished for a gradual shift, to those who
wanted to restructure society radically. Some were ‘conservatives’,
others were ‘liberals’ or ‘radicals’. What did these terms really mean
in the context of the time? What separated these strands of politics
and what linked them together? We must remember that these terms
do not mean the same thing in all contexts or at all times.
We will look briefly at some of the important political traditions of
the nineteenth century, and see how they influenced change. Then
we will focus on one historical event in which there was an attempt
at a radical transformation of society. Through the revolution in
Russia, socialism became one of the most significant and powerful
ideas to shape society in the twentieth century.

1.1 Liberals, Radicals and Conservatives
One of the groups which looked to change society were the liberals.
Liberals wanted a nation which tolerated all religions. We should
remember that at this time European states usually discriminated in
Reprint 2025-26
25
favour of one religion or another (Britain favoured the Church of
England, Austria and Spain favoured the Catholic Church). Liberals
also opposed the uncontrolled power of dynastic rulers. They wanted
to safeguard the rights of individuals against governments. They
argued for a representative, elected parliamentary government, subject
to laws interpreted by a well-trained judiciary that was independent
of rulers and officials. However, they were not ‘democrats’. They
did not believe in universal adult franchise, that is, the right of every
citizen to vote. They felt men of property mainly should have the
vote. They also did not want the vote for women.
In contrast, radicals wanted a nation in which government was based
on the majority of a country’s population. Many supported women’s
suffragette movements. Unlike liberals, they opposed the privileges
of great landowners and wealthy factory owners. They were not
against the existence of private property but disliked concentration
of property in the hands of a few.
Conservatives were opposed to radicals and liberals. After the French
Revolution, however, even conservatives had opened their minds to
the need for change. Earlier, in the eighteenth century, conservatives
had been generally opposed to the idea of change. By the nineteenth
century, they accepted that some change was inevitable but believed
that the past had to be respected and change had to be brought about
through a slow process.

India and the Contemporary World
Such differing ideas about societal change clashed during the social
and political turmoil that followed the French Revolution. The
various attempts at revolution and national transformation in the
nineteenth century helped define both the limits and potential of
these political tendencies.

1.2 Industrial Society and Social Change
These political trends were signs of a new time. It was a time of
profound social and economic changes. It was a time when new cities
came up and new industrialised regions developed, railways expanded
and the Industrial Revolution occurred.
Industrialisation brought men, women and children to factories. Work
hours were often long and wages were poor. Unemployment was
common, particularly during times of low demand for industrial goods.
Housing and sanitation were problems since towns were growing
rapidly. Liberals and radicals searched for solutions to these issues.

Socialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution
Almost all industries were the property of individuals. Liberals and
radicals themselves were often property owners and employers.
Having made their wealth through trade or industrial ventures, they
felt that such effort should be encouraged – that its benefits would
be achieved if the workforce in the economy was healthy and citizens
were educated. Opposed to the privileges the old aristocracy had by
birth, they firmly believed in the value of individual effort, labour
and enterprise. If freedom of individuals was ensured, if the poor
could labour, and those with capital could operate without restraint,
they believed that societies would develop. Many working men and
women who wanted changes in the world rallied around liberal and
radical groups and parties in the early nineteenth century.
Some nationalists, liberals and radicals wanted revolutions to put an
end to the kind of governments established in Europe in 1815. In
France, Italy, Germany and Russia, they became revolutionaries and
worked to overthrow existing monarchs. Nationalists talked of
revolutions that would create ‘nations’ where all citizens would have
Reprint 2025-26
27
equal rights. After 1815, Giuseppe Mazzini, an Italian nationalist, conspired
with others to achieve this in Italy. Nationalists elsewhere – including India
– read his writings.

1.3 The Coming of Socialism to Europe
Perhaps one of the most far-reaching visions of how society should be
structured was socialism. By the mid - nineteenth century in Europe, socialism
was a well-known body of ideas that attracted widespread attention.
Socialists were against private property, and saw it as the root of all social ills
of the time. Why? Individuals owned the property that gave employment
but the propertied were concerned only with personal gain and not with
the welfare of those who made the property productive. So if society as a
whole rather than single individuals controlled property, more attention
would be paid to collective social interests. Socialists wanted this change and
campaigned for it.
How could a society without property operate? What would be the basis of
socialist society?

India and the Contemporary World
Socialists had different visions of the future. Some believed in the idea of
cooperatives. Robert Owen (1771-1858), a leading English manufacturer,
sought to build a cooperative community called New Harmony in Indiana
(USA). Other socialists felt that cooperatives could not be built on a wide
scale only through individual initiative: they demanded that governments
encourage cooperatives. In France, for instance, Louis Blanc (1813-1882)
wanted the government to encourage cooperatives and replace capitalist
enterprises. These cooperatives were to be associations of people who
produced goods together and divided the profits according to the work
done by members.
Karl Marx (1818-1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) added other ideas
to this body of arguments. Marx argued that industrial society was ‘capitalist’.
Capitalists owned the capital invested in factories, and the profit of capitalists
was produced by workers. The conditions of workers could not improve
as long as this profit was accumulated by private capitalists. Workers had to
overthrow capitalism and the rule of private property. Marx believed that
to free themselves from capitalist exploitation, workers had to construct a
radically socialist society where all property was socially controlled. This
would be a communist society. He was convinced that workers would
triumph in their conflict with capitalists. A communist society was the natural
society of the future.

1.4 Support for Socialism
Workers in England and Germany began forming associations to
fight for better living and working conditions. They set up funds to
help members in times of distress and demanded a reduction of working
hours and the right to vote. In Germany, these associations worked closely
with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and helped it win parliamentary
seats. By 1905, socialists and trade unionists formed a Labour Party in
Britain and a Socialist Party in France. However, till 1914, socialists never
succeeded in forming a government in Europe. Represented by strong
figures in parliamentary politics, their ideas did shape legislation, but
governments continued to be run by conservatives, liberals and radicals.

Socialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution
By the 1870s, socialist ideas spread through Europe. To coordinate
their efforts, socialists formed an international body – namely, the
Second International.

popular uprising in Paris between March and May 1871. This was a period when the town council (commune) of Paris was
taken over by a ‘peoples’ government’ consisting of workers, ordinary people, professionals, political activists and others.
The uprising emerged against a background of growing discontent against the policies of the French state. The ‘Paris
Commune’ was ultimately crushed by government troops but it was celebrated by Socialists the world over as a prelude to a
socialist revolution.The Paris Commune is also popularly remembered for two important legacies: one, for its association with
the workers’ red flag – that was the flag adopted by the communards ( revolutionaries) in Paris; two, for the ‘Marseillaise’,
originally written as a war song in 1792, it became a symbol of the Commune and of the struggle for liberty.

In one of the least industrialised of European states this situation was
reversed. Socialists took over the government in Russia through the
October Revolution of 1917. The fall of monarchy in February 1917
and the events of October are normally called the Russian Revolution.
How did this come about? What were the social and political
conditions in Russia when the revolution occurred? To answer these
questions, let us look at Russia a few years before the revolution.

In 1914, Tsar Nicholas II ruled Russia and its empire. Besides the
territory around Moscow, the Russian empire included current-day
Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, parts of Poland, Ukraine and
Belarus. It stretched to the Pacific and comprised today’s Central
Asian states, as well as Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The majority
religion was Russian Orthodox Christianity – which had grown out
of the Greek Orthodox Church – but the empire also included
Catholics, Protestants, Muslims and Buddhists.

2.2 Economy and Society
At the beginning of the twentieth century, the vast majority of
Russia’s people were agriculturists. About 85 per cent of the Russian
empire’s population earned their living from agriculture. This
proportion was higher than in most European countries. For instance,
in France and Germany the proportion was between 40 per cent and
50 per cent. In the empire, cultivators produced for the market as
well as for their own needs and Russia was a major exporter of grain.
Industry was found in pockets. Prominent industrial areas were
St Petersburg and Moscow. Craftsmen undertook much of the
production, but large factories existed alongside craft workshops.
Many factories were set up in the 1890s, when Russia’s railway
network was extended, and foreign investment in industry increased.
Coal production doubled and iron and steel output quadrupled. By
the 1900s, in some areas factory workers and craftsmen were almost
equal in number.

Fig.5 – Unemployed peasants in pre-war
St Petersburg.
Many survived by eating at charitable
kitchens and living in poorhouses.

Workers were a divided social group. Some had strong links with
the villages from which they came. Others had settled in cities
permanently. Workers were divided by skill. A metalworker of St.
Petersburg recalled, ‘Metalworkers considered themselves aristocrats
among other workers. Their occupations demanded more training
and skill . . . ’ Women made up 31 per cent of the factory labour
force by 1914, but they were paid less than men (between half and
three-quarters of a man’s wage). Divisions among workers showed
themselves in dress and manners too. Some workers formed
associations to help members in times of unemployment or financial
hardship but such associations were few.

Socialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution
Most industry was the private property of industrialists. Government
supervised large factories to ensure minimum wages and limited hours
of work. But factory inspectors could not prevent rules being broken.
In craft units and small workshops, the working day was sometimes
15 hours, compared with 10 or 12 hours in factories. Accommodation
varied from rooms to dormitories.

Fig.6 – Workers sleeping in bunkers in a
dormitory in pre-revolutionary Russia.
They slept in shifts and could not keep their
families with them.

Despite divisions, workers did unite to strike work (stop work) when
they disagreed with employers about dismissals or work conditions.
These strikes took place frequently in the textile industry during
1896-1897, and in the metal industry during 1902.
In the countryside, peasants cultivated most of the land. But the
nobility, the crown and the Orthodox Church owned large
properties. Like workers, peasants too were divided. They were also
Reprint 2025-26
31
deeply religious. But except in a few cases they had no respect for the
nobility. Nobles got their power and position through their services
to the Tsar, not through local popularity. This was unlike France
where, during the French Revolution in Brittany, peasants respected
nobles and fought for them. In Russia, peasants wanted the land of
the nobles to be given to them. Frequently, they refused to pay rent
and even murdered landlords. In 1902, this occurred on a large scale
in south Russia. And in 1905, such incidents took place all
over Russia.
Russian peasants were different from other European peasants in
another way. They pooled their land together periodically and their
commune (mir) divided it according to the needs of individual families.

2.3 Socialism in Russia
India and the Contemporary World
All political parties were illegal in Russia before 1914. The Russian
Social Democratic Workers Party was founded in 1898 by socialists
who respected Marx’s ideas. However, because of government
policing, it had to operate as an illegal organisation. It set up a
newspaper, mobilised workers and organised strikes.
Some Russian socialists felt that the Russian peasant custom of dividing
land periodically made them natural socialists. So peasants, not
workers, would be the main force of the revolution, and Russia could
become socialist more quickly than other countries. Socialists were
active in the countryside through the late nineteenth century. They
formed the Socialist Revolutionary Party in 1900. This party struggled
for peasants’ rights and demanded that land belonging to nobles be
transferred to peasants. Social Democrats disagreed with Socialist
Revolutionaries about peasants. Lenin felt that peasants were not
one united group. Some were poor and others rich, some worked as
labourers while others were capitalists who employed workers. Given
this ‘differentiation’ within them, they could not all be part of a
socialist movement.
The party was divided over the strategy of organisation. Vladimir
Lenin (who led the Bolshevik group) thought that in a repressive
society like Tsarist Russia the party should be disciplined and should
control the number and quality of its members. Others (Mensheviks)
thought that the party should be open to all (as in Germany).

parliament. Liberals in Russia campaigned to end this state of affairs.
Together with the Social Democrats and Socialist Revolutionaries,
they worked with peasants and workers during the revolution of
1905 to demand a constitution. They were supported in the empire
by nationalists (in Poland for instance) and in Muslim-dominated
areas by jadidists who wanted modernised Islam to lead their societies.
The year 1904 was a particularly bad one for Russian workers. Prices
of essential goods rose so quickly that real wages declined by 20 per
cent. The membership of workers’ associations rose dramatically.
When four members of the Assembly of Russian Workers, which
had been formed in 1904, were dismissed at the Putilov Iron Works,
there was a call for industrial action. Over the next few days over
110,000 workers in St Petersburg went on strike demanding a
reduction in the working day to eight hours, an increase in wages
and improvement in working conditions.

During the 1905 Revolution, the Tsar allowed the creation of an
elected consultative Parliament or Duma. For a brief while during
the revolution, there existed a large number of trade unions and
factory committees made up of factory workers. After 1905, most
committees and unions worked unofficially, since they were declared
illegal. Severe restrictions were placed on political activity. The Tsar
dismissed the first Duma within 75 days and the re-elected second
Duma within three months. He did not want any questioning of his
authority or any reduction in his power. He changed the voting
laws and packed the third Duma with conservative politicians. Liberals
and revolutionaries were kept out.

Socialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution
When the procession of workers led by Father Gapon reached the
Winter Palace it was attacked by the police and the Cossacks. Over
100 workers were killed and about 300 wounded. The incident,
known as Bloody Sunday, started a series of events that became known
as the 1905 Revolution. Strikes took place all over the country and
universities closed down when student bodies staged walkouts,
complaining about the lack of civil liberties. Lawyers, doctors,
engineers and other middle-class workers established the Union of
Unions and demanded a constituent assembly.

and the war was fought outside Europe as well as
in Europe. This was the First World War.
In Russia, the war was initially popular and people
rallied around Tsar Nicholas II. As the war
continued, though, the Tsar refused to consult the
main parties in the Duma. Support wore thin. AntiGerman sentiments ran high, as can be seen in the
renaming of St Petersburg – a German name – as
Petrograd. The Tsarina Alexandra’s German
origins and poor advisers, especially a monk called
Rasputin, made the autocracy unpopular.

India and the Contemporary World
The First World War on the ‘eastern front’ differed
from that on the ‘western front’. In the west, armies
fought from trenches stretched along eastern
France. In the east, armies moved a good deal and
fought battles leaving large casualties. Defeats were
shocking and demoralising. Russia’s armies lost
badly in Germany and Austria between 1914 and
1916. There were over 7 million casualties by 1917.
As they retreated, the Russian army destroyed
crops and buildings to prevent the enemy from
being able to live off the land. The destruction of
crops and buildings led to over 3 million refugees in Russia. The
situation discredited the government and the Tsar. Soldiers did not
wish to fight such a war.
The war also had a severe impact on industry. Russia’s own industries
were few in number and the country was cut off from other suppliers
of industrial goods by German control of the Baltic Sea. Industrial
equipment disintegrated more rapidly in Russia than elsewhere in
Europe. By 1916, railway lines began to break down. Able-bodied
men were called up to the war. As a result, there were labour shortages
and small workshops producing essentials were shut down. Large
supplies of grain were sent to feed the army. For the people in the
cities, bread and flour became scarce. By the winter of 1916, riots at
bread shops were common.

3 The February Revolution in Petrograd
In the winter of 1917, conditions in the capital, Petrograd, were grim.
The layout of the city seemed to emphasise the divisions among its
people. The workers’ quarters and factories were located on the right
bank of the River Neva. On the left bank were the fashionable areas,
the Winter Palace, and official buildings, including the palace where
the Duma met. In February 1917, food shortages were deeply felt in
the workers’ quarters. The winter was very cold – there had been
exceptional frost and heavy snow. Parliamentarians wishing to
preserve elected government, were opposed to the Tsar’s desire to dissolve
the Duma.

On Sunday, 25 February, the government
suspended the Duma. Politicians spoke out against
the measure. Demonstrators returned in force to
the streets of the left bank on the 26th. On the
27th, the Police Headquarters were ransacked. The
streets thronged with people raising slogans about
bread, wages, better hours and democracy. The
government tried to control the situation and
called out the cavalry once again. However, the
cavalry refused to fire on the demonstrators. An
officer was shot at the barracks of a regiment and
three other regiments mutinied, voting to join the
striking workers. By that evening, soldiers and

On 22 Febr uar y, a lockout took place at a
factory on the right bank. The next day, workers
in fifty factories called a strike in sympathy.
In many factories, women led the way to strikes.
This came to be called the International Women’s
Day. Demonstrating workers crossed from the
factory quarters to the centre of the capital – the
Nevskii Prospekt. At this stage, no political party
was actively organising the movement. As the
fashionable quarters and official buildings were
surrounded by workers, the government imposed
a curfew. Demonstrators dispersed by the evening,
but they came back on the 24th and 25th. The
government called out the cavalry and police to
keep an eye on them.

striking workers had gathered to form a ‘soviet’ or ‘council’ in the
same building as the Duma met. This was the Petrograd Soviet.
The very next day, a delegation went to see the Tsar. Military
commanders advised him to abdicate. He followed their advice and
abdicated on 2 March. Soviet leaders and Duma leaders formed a
Provisional Government to run the country. Russia’s future would
be decided by a constituent assembly, elected on the basis of universal
adult suffrage. Petrograd had led the February Revolution that
brought down the monarchy in February 1917.

Women in the February Revolution
‘Women workers, often ... inspired their male co-workers … At the Lorenz telephone
factory, … Marfa Vasileva almost single handedly called a successful strike. Already that
morning, in celebration of Women’s Day, women workers had presented red bows to the
men … Then Marfa Vasileva, a milling machine operator stopped work and declared an
impromptu strike. The workers on the floor were ready to support her … The foreman
informed the management and sent her a loaf of bread. She took the bread but refused to
go back to work. The administrator asked her again why she refused to work and she
replied, “I cannot be the only one who is satiated when others are hungry”. Women
workers from another section of the factory gathered around Marfa in support and
gradually all the other women ceased working. Soon the men downed their tools as well
and the entire crowd rushed onto the street.’

3.1 After February
Army officials, landowners and industrialists were influential in
the Provisional Government. But the liberals as well as socialists
among them worked towards an elected government. Restrictions
on public meetings and associations were removed. ‘Soviets’, like
the Petrograd Soviet, were set up everywhere, though no common
system of election was followed.
In April 1917, the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin returned to
Russia from his exile. He and the Bolsheviks had opposed the war
since 1914. Now he felt it was time for soviets to take over power.
He declared that the war be brought to a close, land be transferred
to the peasants, and banks be nationalised. These three demands
were Lenin’s ‘April Theses’. He also argued that the Bolshevik Party
rename itself the Communist Party to indicate its new radical aims.

April Theses. They thought that the time was not yet ripe for a

supported. But the developments of the subsequent months changed
their attitude.
Through the summer the workers’ movement spread. In industrial
areas, factory committees were formed which began questioning
the way industrialists ran their factories. Trade unions grew in
number. Soldiers’ committees were formed in the army. In June,
about 500 Soviets sent representatives to an All Russian Congress
of Soviets. As the Provisional Government saw its power reduce
and Bolshevik influence grow, it decided to take stern measures
against the spreading discontent. It resisted attempts by workers
to run factories and began arresting leaders. Popular
demonstrations staged by the Bolsheviks in July 1917 were sternly
repressed. Many Bolshevik leaders had to go into hiding or flee.

Meanwhile in the countryside, peasants and their Socialist

committees were formed to handle this. Encouraged by the
Socialist Revolutionaries, peasants seized land between July and
September 1917.

3.2 The Revolution of October 1917
Box 2
As the conflict between the Provisional Government and the
Bolsheviks grew, Lenin feared the Provisional Government would
set up a dictatorship. In September, he began discussions for an
uprising against the government. Bolshevik supporters in the army,
soviets and factories were brought together.
On 16 October 1917, Lenin persuaded the Petrograd Soviet and
the Bolshevik Party to agree to a socialist seizure of power. A
Military Revolutionary Committee was appointed by the Soviet
under Leon Trotskii to organise the seizure. The date of the event
was kept a secret.
The uprising began on 24 October. Sensing trouble, Prime Minister
Kerenskii had left the city to summon troops. At dawn, military
men loyal to the government seized the buildings of two Bolshevik
newspapers. Pro-government troops were sent to take over telephone
and telegraph offices and protect the Winter Palace. In a swift
response, the Military Revolutionary Committee ordered its
supporters to seize government offices and arrest ministers. Late in
the day, the ship Aurora shelled the Winter Palace. Other vessels
sailed down the Neva and took over various military points. By
nightfall, the city was under the committee’s control and the
ministers had surrendered. At a meeting of the All Russian Congress
of Soviets in Petrograd, the majority approved the Bolshevik action.
Uprisings took place in other cities. There was heavy fighting –
especially in Moscow – but by December, the Bolsheviks controlled
the Moscow-Petrograd area.

Russia followed the Julian calendar until
1 February 1918. The country then changed to
the Gregorian calendar, which is followed
everywhere today. The Gregorian dates are
13 days ahead of the Julian dates. So by our

4 What Changed after October?
The Bolsheviks were totally opposed to private property. Most
industry and banks were nationalised in November 1917. This meant
that the government took over ownership and management. Land
was declared social property and peasants were allowed to seize the
land of the nobility. In cities, Bolsheviks enforced the partition of
large houses according to family requirements. They banned the
use of the old titles of aristocracy. To assert the change, new
uniforms were designed for the army and officials, following a
clothing competition organised in 1918 – when the Soviet hat
(budeonovka) was chosen.

this led to experiments in the arts
and architecture. But many became
disillusioned because of the
censorship the Party encouraged.

Cooperation did not work where Russian colonists themselves turned

government represented.
Partly to remedy this, most non-Russian nationalities were given
political autonomy in the Soviet Union (USSR) – the state the
Bolsheviks created from the Russian empire in December 1922. But
since this was combined with unpopular policies that the Bolsheviks
forced the local government to follow – like the harsh discouragement

4.2 Making a Socialist Society
During the civil war, the Bolsheviks kept industries and banks
nationalised. They permitted peasants to cultivate the land that had
been socialised. Bolsheviks used confiscated land to demonstrate what
collective work could be.
A process of centralised planning was introduced. Officials assessed
how the economy could work and set targets for a five-year period.
On this basis they made the Five Year Plans. The government fixed
all prices to promote industrial growth during the first two ‘Plans’

(1927-1932 and 1933-1938). Centralised planning led to economic
growth. Industrial production increased (between 1929 and 1933 by
100 per cent in the case of oil, coal and steel). New factory cities
came into being.
However, rapid construction led to poor working conditions. In
the city of Magnitogorsk, the construction of a steel plant was achieved
in three years. Workers lived hard lives and the result was 550
stoppages of work in the first year alone. In living quarters, ‘in the
wintertime, at 40 degrees below, people had to climb down from the
fourth floor and dash across the street in order to go to the toilet’.
An extended schooling system developed, and arrangements were
made for factory workers and peasants to enter universities. Crèches
were established in factories for the children of women workers.
Cheap public health care was provided. Model living quarters were
set up for workers. The effect of all this was uneven, though, since
government resources were limited.

4.3 Stalinism and Collectivisation
The period of the early Planned Economy was linked to
the disasters of the collectivisation of agriculture. By 19271928, the towns in Soviet Russia were facing an acute
problem of grain supplies. The government fixed prices
at which grain must be sold, but the peasants refused to sell their
grain to government buyers at these prices.
Stalin, who headed the party after the death of Lenin, introduced
firm emergency measures. He believed that rich peasants and traders
in the countryside were holding stocks in the hope of higher prices.
Speculation had to be stopped and supplies confiscated.

India and the Contemporary World
In 1928, Party members toured the grain-producing areas, supervising
enforced grain collections, and raiding ‘kulaks’ – the name for wellto-do peasants. As shortages continued, the decision was taken to
collectivise farms. It was argued that grain shortages were partly due
to the small size of holdings. After 1917, land had been given over to
peasants. These small-sized peasant farms could not be modernised.
To develop modern farms, and run them along industrial lines with
machinery, it was necessary to ‘eliminate kulaks’, take away land
from peasants, and establish state-controlled large farms.

Fig.18 – A poster during collectivisation. It
states: ‘We shall strike at the kulak working for
the decrease in cultivation.’
What followed was Stalin’s collectivisation programme. From 1929,
the Party forced all peasants to cultivate in collective farms (kolkhoz).
The bulk of land and implements were transferred to the ownership
of collective farms. Peasants worked on the land, and the kolkhoz
profit was shared. Enraged peasants resisted the authorities and
destroyed their livestock. Between 1929 and 1931, the number of
cattle fell by one-third. Those who resisted collectivisation were
severely punished. Many were deported and exiled. As they resisted
collectivisation, peasants argued that they were not rich and they
were not against socialism. They merely did not want to work in
collective farms for a variety of reasons. Stalin’s government allowed
some independent cultivation, but treated such cultivators
unsympathetically.
In spite of collectivisation, production did not increase immediately.
In fact, the bad harvests of 1930-1933 led to one of most devastating
famines in Soviet history when over 4 million died.

Many within the Party criticised the confusion in industrial
production under the Planned Economy and the consequences of
collectivisation. Stalin and his sympathisers charged these critics with
conspiracy against socialism. Accusations were made throughout the
country, and by 1939, over 2 million were in prisons or labour camps.
Most were innocent of the crimes, but no one spoke for them. A
large number were forced to make false confessions under torture
and were executed – several among them were talented professionals.

5 The Global Influence of the Russian
Revolution and the USSR
Existing socialist parties in Europe did not wholly approve of the
way the Bolsheviks took power – and kept it. However, the possibility
of a workers’ state fired people’s imagination across the world. In
many countries, communist parties were formed – like the
Communist Party of Great Britain. The Bolsheviks encouraged
colonial peoples to follow their experiment. Many non-Russians from
outside the USSR participated in the Conference of the Peoples of
the East (1920) and the Bolshevik-founded Comintern (an international
union of pro-Bolshevik socialist parties). Some received education in
the USSR’s Communist University of the Workers of the East. By
the time of the outbreak of the Second World War, the USSR had
given socialism a global face and world stature.
Yet by the 1950s it was acknowledged within the country that the
style of government in the USSR was not in keeping with the ideals
of the Russian Revolution. In the world socialist movement too it
was recognised that all was not well in the Soviet Union. A backward
country had become a great power. Its industries and agriculture
had developed and the poor were being fed. But it had denied the
essential freedoms to its citizens and carried out its developmental
projects through repressive policies. By the end of the twentieth
century, the international reputation of the USSR as a socialist
country had declined though it was recognised that socialist ideals
still enjoyed respect among its people. But in each country the ideas
of socialism were rethought in a variety of different ways.

Among those the Russian Revolution inspired were many Indians. Several
attended the Communist University. By the mid-1920s the Communist Party was
formed in India. Its members kept in touch with the Soviet Communist Party.
Important Indian political and cultural figures took an interest in the Soviet
experiment and visited Russia, among them Jawaharlal Nehru and Rabindranath
Tagore, who wrote about Soviet Socialism. In India, writings gave impressions of
Soviet Russia. In Hindi, R.S. Avasthi wrote in 1920-21 Russian Revolution, Lenin,
His Life and His Thoughts, and later The Red Revolution . S.D. Vidyalankar
wrote The Rebirth of Russia and The Soviet State of Russia. There was much
that was written in Bengali, Marathi, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu.

Nazism and the Rise
of Hitler
In the spring of 1945, a little eleven-year-old German boy called
Helmuth was lying in bed when he overheard his parents discussing
something in serious tones. His father, a prominent physician,
deliberated with his wife whether the time had come to kill the entire
family, or if he should commit suicide alone. His father spoke about
his fear of revenge, saying, ‘Now the Allies will do to us what we did to
the crippled and Jews.’ The next day, he took Helmuth to the woods,
where they spent their last happy time together, singing old children’s
songs. Later, Helmuth’s father shot himself in his office. Helmuth
remembers that he saw his father’s bloody uniform being burnt in the
family fireplace. So traumatised was he by what he had overheard and
what had happened, that he reacted by refusing to eat at home for the
following nine years! He was afraid that his mother might poison him.

Although Helmuth may not have realised all that it meant, his father
had been a Nazi and a supporter of Adolf Hitler. Many of you will
know something about the Nazis and Hitler. You probably know
of Hitler’s determination to make Germany into a mighty power
and his ambition of conquering all of Europe. You may have heard
that he killed Jews. But Nazism was not one or two isolated acts. It
was a system, a structure of ideas about the world and politics. Let
us try and understand what Nazism was all about. Let us see why
Helmuth’s father killed himself and what the basis of his fear was.
In May 1945, Germany surrendered to the Allies. Anticipating what
was coming, Hitler, his propaganda minister Goebbels and his entire
family committed suicide collectively in his Berlin bunker in April.
At the end of the war, an International Military Tribunal at
Nuremberg was set up to prosecute Nazi war criminals for Crimes
against Peace, for War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity.

and ethical questions and invited worldwide condemnation. What
were these acts?
Under the shadow of the Second World War, Germany had waged
a genocidal war, which resulted in the mass murder of selected
groups of innocent civilians of Europe. The number of people killed
included 6 million Jews, 200,000 Gypsies, 1 million Polish civilians,
70,000 Germans who were considered mentally and physically
disabled, besides innumerable political opponents. Nazis devised
an unprecedented means of killing people, that is, by gassing them in
various killing centres like Auschwitz. The Nuremberg Tribunal
sentenced only eleven leading Nazis to death. Many others were
imprisoned for life. The retribution did come, yet the punishment
of the Nazis was far short of the brutality and extent of their crimes.
The Allies did not want to be as harsh on defeated Germany as
they had been after the First World War.
Everyone came to feel that the rise of Nazi Germany could be
partly traced back to the German experience at the end of the
First World War.

1 Birth of the Weimar Republic
Germany, a powerful empire in the early years of the twentieth
century, fought the First World War (1914-1918) alongside the
Austrian empire and against the Allies (England, France and Russia.)
All joined the war enthusiastically hoping to gain from a quick
victory. Little did they realise that the war would stretch on,
eventually draining Europe of all its resources. Germany made initial
gains by occupying France and Belgium. However the Allies,
strengthened by the US entry in 1917, won , defeating Germany and the
Central Powers in November 1918.
The defeat of Imperial Germany and the abdication of the emperor
gave an opportunity to parliamentary parties to recast German polity.
A National Assembly met at Weimar and established a democratic
constitution with a federal structure. Deputies were now elected to
the German Parliament or Reichstag, on the basis of equal and
universal votes cast by all adults including women.

Nazism and the Rise of Hitler
This republic, however, was not received well by its own people
largely because of the terms it was forced to accept after Germany’s
defeat at the end of the First World War. The peace treaty at
Versailles with the Allies was a harsh and humiliating peace. Germany lost
its overseas colonies, a tenth of its population, 13 per cent of its territories,
75 per cent of its iron and 26 per cent of its coal to France, Poland,
Denmark and Lithuania. The Allied Powers demilitarised Germany to
weaken its power. The War Guilt Clause held Germany responsible for
the war and damages the Allied countries suffered. Germany was forced
to pay compensation amounting to £6 billion. The Allied armies also
occupied the resource-rich Rhineland for much of the 1920s. Many
Germans held the new Weimar Republic responsible for not only the
defeat in the war but the disgrace at Versailles.

1.1 The Effects of the War
India and the Contemporary World
The war had a devastating impact on the entire continent both
psychologically and financially. From a continent of creditors,
Europe turned into one of debtors. Unfortunately, the infant Weimar
Republic was being made to pay for the sins of the old empire. The
republic carried the burden of war guilt and national humiliation
and was financially crippled by being forced to pay compensation.
Those who supported the Weimar Republic, mainly Socialists, Catholics
and Democrats, became easy targets of attack in the conservative
nationalist circles. They were mockingly called the ‘November criminals’.
This mindset had a major impact on the political developments of the
early 1930s, as we will soon see.
The First World War left a deep imprint on European society and
polity. Soldiers came to be placed above civilians. Politicians and
publicists laid great stress on the need for men to be aggressive, strong
and masculine. The media glorified trench life. The truth, however,
was that soldiers lived miserable lives in these trenches, trapped with
rats feeding on corpses. They faced poisonous gas and enemy shelling,
and witnessed their ranks reduce rapidly. Aggressive war propaganda
and national honour occupied centre stage in the public sphere, while
popular support grew for conservative dictatorships that had recently
come into being. Democracy was indeed a young and fragile idea,
which could not survive the instabilities of interwar Europe.

1.2 Political Radicalism and Economic Crises
The birth of the Weimar Republic coincided with the revolutionary
uprising of the Spartacist League on the pattern of the Bolshevik
Revolution in Russia. Soviets of workers and sailors were established

In the winter of 1918-1919 the streets of Berlin were taken over by the people. Political demonstrations became common.

Political radicalisation was only heightened by the economic crisis
of 1923. Germany had fought the war largely on loans and had to
pay war reparations in gold. This depleted gold reserves at a time
resources were scarce. In 1923 Germany refused to pay, and the
French occupied its leading industrial area, Ruhr, to claim their coal.
Germany retaliated with passive resistance and printed paper currency
recklessly. With too much printed money in circulation, the value
of the German mark fell. In April the US dollar was equal to 24,000
marks, in July 353,000 marks, in August 4,621,000 marks and at

in many cities. The political atmosphere in Berlin was charged with
demands for Soviet-style governance. Those opposed to this – such
as the socialists, Democrats and Catholics – met in Weimar to give
shape to the democratic republic. The Weimar Republic crushed the
uprising with the help of a war veterans organisation called Free
Corps. The anguished Spartacists later founded the Communist Party of
Germany. Communists and Socialists henceforth became irreconcilable
enemies and could not make common cause against Hitler. Both
revolutionaries and militant nationalists craved for radical solutions.

98,860,000 marks by December, the figure had run into trillions. As
the value of the mark collapsed, prices of goods soared. The image of
Germans carrying cartloads of currency notes to buy a loaf of bread
was widely publicised evoking worldwide sympathy. This crisis came
to be known as hyperinflation, a situation when prices rise
phenomenally high.
Eventually, the Americans intervened and bailed Germany out of
the crisis by introducing the Dawes Plan, which reworked the terms
of reparation to ease the financial burden on Germans.

1.3 The Years of Depression
India and the Contemporary World
The years between 1924 and 1928 saw some stability. Yet this was
built on sand. German investments and industrial recovery were
totally dependent on short-term loans, largely from the USA. This
support was withdrawn when the Wall Street Exchange crashed in
1929. Fearing a fall in prices, people made frantic efforts to sell their
shares. On one single day, 24 October, 13 million shares were sold.
This was the start of the Great Economic Depression. Over the next
three years, between 1929 and 1932, the national income of the USA
fell by half. Factories shut down, exports fell, farmers were badly hit
and speculators withdrew their money from the market. The effects
of this recession in the US economy were felt worldwide.

Fig.5 – Homeless men queuing up for a
night’s shelter, 1923.

The German economy was the worst hit by the economic crisis. By
1932, industrial production was reduced to 40 per cent of the 1929
level. Workers lost their jobs or were paid reduced wages. The number
of unemployed touched an unprecedented 6 million. On the streets
of Germany you could see men with placards around their necks
saying, ‘Willing to do any work’. Unemployed youths played cards
or simply sat at street corners, or desperately queued up at the local
employment exchange. As jobs disappeared, the youth took to
criminal activities and total despair became commonplace.
The economic crisis created deep anxieties and fears in people. The
middle classes, especially salaried employees and pensioners, saw
their savings diminish when the currency lost its value. Small
businessmen, the self-employed and retailers suffered as their

businesses got ruined. These sections of society were filled with the
fear of proletarianisation, an anxiety of being reduced to the ranks
of the working class, or worse still, the unemployed. Only organised
workers could manage to keep their heads above water, but
unemployment weakened their bargaining power. Big business was
in crisis. The large mass of peasantry was affected by a sharp fall in
agricultural prices and women, unable to fill their children’s
stomachs, were filled with a sense of deep despair.
Politically too the Weimar Republic was fragile. The Weimar
constitution had some inherent defects, which made it unstable
and vulnerable to dictatorship. One was proportional
representation. This made achieving a majority by any one party a
near impossible task, leading to a rule by coalitions. Another defect
was Article 48, which gave the President the powers to impose
emergency, suspend civil rights and rule by decree. Within its short
life, the Weimar Republic saw twenty different cabinets lasting on
an average 239 days, and a liberal use of Article 48. Yet the crisis
could not be managed. People lost confidence in the democratic
parliamentary system, which seemed to offer no solutions.

2 Hitler’s Rise to Power
This crisis in the economy, polity and society formed the background
to Hitler’s rise to power. Born in 1889 in Austria, Hitler spent his
youth in poverty. When the First World War broke out, he enrolled
for the army, acted as a messenger in the front, became a corporal, and
earned medals for bravery. The German defeat horrified him and the
Versailles Treaty made him furious. In 1919, he joined a small group
called the German Workers’ Party. He subsequently took over the
organisation and renamed it the National Socialist German Workers’
Party. This party came to be known as the Nazi Party.

India and the Contemporary World
In 1923, Hitler planned to seize control of Bavaria, march to Berlin
and capture power. He failed, was arrested, tried for treason, and
later released. The Nazis could not effectively mobilise popular
support till the early 1930s. It was during the Great Depression that
Nazism became a mass movement. As we have seen, after 1929, banks
collapsed and businesses shut down, workers lost their jobs and the
middle classes were threatened with destitution. In such a situation
Nazi propaganda stirred hopes of a better future. In 1928, the Nazi
Party got no more than 2. 6 per cent votes in the Reichstag – the
German parliament. By 1932, it had become the largest party with
37 per cent votes.

important aspect of these was the
demonstration of Nazi power as various
organisations paraded past Hitler, swore

Hitler was a powerful speaker. His passion and his words moved
people. He promised to build a strong nation, undo the injustice of
the Versailles Treaty and restore the dignity of the German people.
He promised employment for those looking for work, and a secure
future for the youth. He promised to weed out all foreign influences
and resist all foreign ‘conspiracies’ against Germany.

Nazism and the Rise of Hitler
Hitler devised a new style of politics. He understood the significance
of rituals and spectacle in mass mobilisation. Nazis held massive rallies
Nazi propaganda skilfully projected Hitler as a messiah, a saviour, as
someone who had arrived to deliver people from their distress. It is
an image that captured the imagination of a people whose sense of
dignity and pride had been shattered, and who were living in a time
of acute economic and political crises.

2.1 The Destruction of Democracy
On 30 January 1933, President Hindenburg offered the
Chancellorship, the highest position in the cabinet of ministers, to
Hitler. By now the Nazis had managed to rally the conservatives to
their cause. Having acquired power, Hitler set out to dismantle the
structures of democratic rule. A mysterious fire that broke out in
the German Parliament building in February facilitated his move.
The Fire Decree of 28 February 1933 indefinitely suspended civic
rights like freedom of speech, press and assembly that had been
guaranteed by the Weimar constitution. Then he turned on his archenemies, the Communists, most of whom were hurriedly packed off
to the newly established concentration camps. The repression of
the Communists was severe. Out of the surviving 6,808 arrest files
of Duesseldorf, a small city of half a million population, 1,440 were
those of Communists alone. They were, however, only one among
the 52 types of victims persecuted by the Nazis across the country.

India and the Contemporary World
On 3 March 1933, the famous Enabling Act was passed. This Act
established dictatorship in Germany. It gave Hitler all powers to
sideline Parliament and rule by decree. All political parties and trade
unions were banned except for the Nazi Party and its affiliates. The
state established complete control over the economy, media, army
and judiciary.
Special surveillance and security forces were created to control and
order society in ways that the Nazis wanted. Apart from the already
existing regular police in green uniform and the SA or the Storm
Troopers, these included the Gestapo (secret state police), the SS (the
protection squads), criminal police and the Security Service (SD). It
was the extra-constitutional powers of these newly organised forces
that gave the Nazi state its reputation as the most dreaded criminal
state. People could now be detained in Gestapo torture chambers,
rounded up and sent to concentration camps, deported at will or
arrested without any legal procedures. The police forces acquired
powers to rule with impunity.

2.2 Reconstruction
Hitler assigned the responsibility of economic recovery to the
economist Hjalmar Schacht who aimed at full production and full
employment through a state-funded work-creation programme. This
project produced the famous German superhighways and the
people’s car, the Volkswagen.
In foreign policy also Hitler acquired quick successes. He pulled
out of the League of Nations in 1933, reoccupied the Rhineland in
1936, and integrated Austria and Germany in 1938 under the slogan,
One people, One empire, and One leader. He then went on to wrest Germanspeaking Sudentenland from Czechoslovakia, and gobbled up the
entire country. In all of this he had the unspoken support of
England, which had considered the Versailles verdict too harsh.
These quick successes at home and abroad seemed to reverse the
destiny of the country.

economic crisis. Resources were to be accumulated through
expansion of territory. In September 1939, Germany invaded
Poland. This started a war with France and England. In September
1940, a Tripartite Pact was signed between Germany, Italy and
Japan, strengthening Hitler’s claim to international power. Puppet
regimes, supportive of Nazi Germany, were installed in a large
part of Europe. By the end of 1940, Hitler was at the pinnacle of
his power.
Hitler now moved to achieve his long-term aim of conquering
Eastern Europe. He wanted to ensure food supplies and living space
for Germans. He attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941. In this
historic blunder Hitler exposed the German western front to British
aerial bombing and the eastern front to the powerful Soviet armies.
The Soviet Red Army inflicted a crushing and humiliating defeat
on Germany at Stalingrad. After this the Soviet Red Army
hounded out the retreating German soldiers until they reached the
heart of Berlin, establishing Soviet hegemony over the entire Eastern
Europe for half a century thereafter.

India and the Contemporary World
Meanwhile, the USA had resisted involvement in the war. It was
unwilling to once again face all the economic problems that the
First World War had caused. But it could not stay out of the war
for long. Japan was expanding its power in the east. It had occupied
French Indo-China and was planning attacks on US naval bases in
the Pacific. When Japan extended its support to Hitler and bombed
the US base at Pearl Harbor, the US entered the Second World
War. The war ended in May 1945 with Hitler’s defeat and the US
dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima in Japan.
From this brief account of what happened in the Second World
War, we now return to Helmuth and his father’s story, a story of
Nazi criminality during the war.

3 The Nazi Worldview
Nazi ideology was synonymous with Hitler’s worldview. According
to this there was no equality between people, but only a racial
hierarchy. In this view blond, blue-eyed, Nordic German Aryans
were at the top, while Jews were located at the lowest rung. They
came to be regarded as an anti-race, the arch-enemies of the Aryans.
All other coloured people were placed in between depending upon
their external features. Hitler’s racism borrowed from thinkers like
Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. Darwin was a natural scientist
who tried to explain the creation of plants and animals through the
concept of evolution and natural selection. Herbert Spencer later
added the idea of survival of the fittest. According to this idea, only
those species survived on earth that could adapt themselves to
changing climatic conditions. We should bear in mind that Darwin
never advocated human intervention in what he thought was a purely
natural process of selection. However, his ideas were used by racist
thinkers and politicians to justify imperial rule over conquered
peoples. The Nazi argument was simple: the strongest race would
survive and the weak ones would perish. The Aryan race was the
finest. It had to retain its purity, become stronger and dominate the
world.
The other aspect of Hitler’s ideology related to the geopolitical
concept of Lebensraum, or living space. He believed that new territories
had to be acquired for settlement. This would enhance the area of
the mother country, while enabling the settlers on new lands to retain
an intimate link with the place of their origin. It would also enhance
the material resources and power of the German nation.

extended empire. Nazis wanted only a society of ‘pure and healthy
Nordic Aryans’. They alone were considered ‘desirable’. Only they
were seen as worthy of prospering and multiplying against all others
who were classed as ‘undesirable’. This meant that even those Germans
who were seen as impure or abnormal had no right to exist. Under
the Euthanasia Programme, Helmuth’s father along with other Nazi
officials had condemned to death many Germans who were considered
mentally or physically unfit.
Jews were not the only community classified as ‘undesirable’. There
were others. Many Gypsies and blacks living in Nazi Germany were
considered as racial ‘inferiors’ who threatened the biological purity
of the ‘superior Aryan’ race. They were widely persecuted. Even
Russians and Poles were considered subhuman, and hence undeserving
of any humanity. When Germany occupied Poland and parts of
Russia, captured civilians were forced to work as slave labour. Many
of them died simply through hard work and starvation.

India and the Contemporary World
Jews remained the worst sufferers in Nazi Germany. Nazi hatred of
Jews had a precursor in the traditional Christian hostility towards
Jews. They had been stereotyped as killers of Christ and
usurers.Until medieval times Jews were barred from owning land.
They survived mainly through trade and moneylending. They lived
in separately marked areas called ghettos. They were often persecuted
through periodic organised violence, and expulsion from the land.
However, Hitler’s hatred of Jews was based on pseudoscientific
theories of race, which held that conversion was no solution to
‘the Jewish problem’. It could be solved only through their
total elimination.
From 1933 to 1938 the Nazis terrorised, pauperised and segregated
the Jews, compelling them to leave the country. The next phase,
1939-1945, aimed at concentrating them in certain areas and eventually
killing them in gas chambers in Poland.

3.2 The Racial Utopia
Under the shadow of war, the Nazis proceeded to realise their
murderous, racial ideal. Genocide and war became two sides of the
same coin. Occupied Poland was divided up. Much of north-western
Poland was annexed to Germany. Poles were forced to leave their
homes and properties behind to be occupied by ethnic Germans
brought in from occupied Europe. Poles were then herded like

entire people intellectually and spiritually servile. Polish children
who looked like Aryans were forcibly snatched from their mothers
and examined by ‘race experts’. If they passed the race tests they
were raised in German families and if not, they were deposited in
orphanages where most perished. With some of the largest ghettos
and gas chambers, the General Government also served as the killing

all legal documents and houses. They were kept in Jewish houses in Germany, and in ghettos like Lodz and Warsaw in the east. These
became sites of extreme misery and poverty. Jews had to surrender all their wealth before they entered a ghetto. Soon the ghettos
were brimming with hunger, starvation and disease due to deprivation and poor hygiene.

4 Youth in Nazi Germany
Hitler was fanatically interested in the youth of the country. He felt
that a strong Nazi society could be established only by teaching children
Nazi ideology. This required a control over the child both inside and
outside school.
What happened in schools under Nazism? All schools were ‘cleansed’
and ‘purified’. This meant that teachers who were Jews or seen as
‘politically unreliable’ were dismissed. Children were first segregated:
Germans and Jews could not sit together or play together.
Subsequently, ‘undesirable children’ – Jews, the physically handicapped,
Gypsies – were thrown out of schools. And finally in the 1940s, they
were taken to the gas chambers.

India and the Contemporary World
‘Good German’ children were subjected to a process of Nazi schooling,
a prolonged period of ideological training. School textbooks were
rewritten. Racial science was introduced to justify Nazi ideas of race.
Stereotypes about Jews were popularised even through maths classes.
Children were taught to be loyal and submissive, hate Jews, and worship
Hitler. Even the function of sports was to nurture a spirit of violence
and aggression among children. Hitler believed that boxing could make
children iron hearted, strong and masculine.
Youth organisations were made responsible for educating German
youth in the ‘the spirit of National Socialism’. Ten-year-olds had to
enter Jungvolk. At 14, all boys had to join the Nazi youth organisation
– Hitler Youth – where they learnt to worship war, glorify aggression
and violence, condemn democracy, and hate Jews, communists, Gypsies
and all those categorised as ‘undesirable’. After a period of rigorous
ideological and physical training they joined the Labour Service, usually
at the age of 18. Then they had to serve in the armed forces and enter
one of the Nazi organisations.
The Youth League of the Nazis was founded in 1922. Four years later
it was renamed Hitler Youth. To unify the youth movement under
Nazi control, all other youth organisations were systematically dissolved
and finally banned.

4.1 The Nazi Cult of Motherhood
Children in Nazi Germany were repeatedly told that women were
radically different from men. The fight for equal rights for men
and women that had become part of democratic struggles everywhere
was wrong and it would destroy society. While boys were taught
to be aggressive, masculine and steel hearted, girls were told that
they had to become good mothers and rear pure-blooded Aryan
children. Girls had to maintain the purity of the race, distance

children Nazi values. They had to be the bearers of the Aryan
culture and race.
In 1933 Hitler said: ‘In my state the mother is the most important
citizen.’ But in Nazi Germany all mothers were not treated equally.
Women who bore racially undesirable children were punished
and those who produced racially desirable children were awarded.
They were given favoured treatment in hospitals and were also
entitled to concessions in shops and on theatre tickets and railway
fares. To encourage women to produce many children, Honour
Crosses were awarded. A bronze cross was given for four children,
silver for six and gold for eight or more.
All ‘Aryan’ women who deviated from the prescribed code of
conduct were publicly condemned, and severely punished. Those
who maintained contact with Jews, Poles and Russians were
paraded through the town with shaved heads, blackened faces and
placards hanging around their necks announcing ‘I have sullied
the honour of the nation’. Many received jail sentences and lost
civic honour as well as their husbands and families for this
‘criminal offence’.

4.2. The Art of Propaganda
The Nazi regime used language and media with care, and often to
great effect. The terms they coined to describe their various
practices are not only deceptive. They are chilling. Nazis never
used the words ‘kill’ or ‘murder’ in their official communications.
Mass killings were termed special treatment, final solution (for the Jews),
euthanasia (for the disabled), selection and disinfections. ‘Evacuation’
meant deporting people to gas chambers. Do you know what the
gas chambers were called? They were labelled ‘disinfection-areas’,
and looked like bathrooms equipped with fake showerheads.
Media was carefully used to win support for the regime and
popularise its worldview. Nazi ideas were spread through visual
images, films, radio, posters, catchy slogans and leaflets. In posters,
groups identified as the ‘enemies’ of Germans were stereotyped,
mocked, abused and described as evil. Socialists and liberals were
represented as weak and degenerate. They were attacked as
malicious foreign agents. Propaganda films were made to create
hatred for Jews. The most infamous film was The Eternal Jew.
Orthodox Jews were stereotyped and marked. They were shown

In an address to women at the

We do not consider it correct for the

man, in his main sphere. We consider it
natural that these two worlds remain
distinct…What the man gives in courage
on the battlefield, the woman gives in
eternal self-sacrifice, in eternal pain and
suffering. Every child that women bring
to the world is a battle, a battle waged
for the existence of her people.

Hitler at the Nuremberg Party Rally, 8 September 1934, also
said:
‘The woman is the most stable element in the preservation
of a folk…she has the most unerring sense of everything that
is important to not let a race disappear because it is her
children who would be affected by all this suffering in the
first place…That is why we have integrated the woman in
the struggle of the racial community just as nature and
providence have determined so.’
The Nazis made equal efforts to appeal to all the different sections of
the population. They sought to win their support by suggesting that
Nazis alone could solve all their problems.

5 Ordinary People and the Crimes Against Humanity
How did the common people react to Nazism?
Many saw the world through Nazi eyes, and spoke their mind in
Nazi language. They felt hatred and anger surge inside them when
they saw someone who looked like a Jew. They marked the houses
of Jews and reported suspicious neighbours. They genuinely believed
Nazism would bring prosperity and improve general well-being.
But not every German was a Nazi. Many organised active resistance
to Nazism, braving police repression and death. The large majority
of Germans, however, were passive onlookers and apathetic witnesses.
They were too scared to act, to differ, to protest. They preferred to
look away. Pastor Niemoeller, a resistance fighter, observed an
absence of protest, an uncanny silence, amongst ordinary Germans
in the face of brutal and organised crimes committed against people
in the Nazi empire. He wrote movingly about this silence:
‘First they came for the Communists,
Well, I was not a Communist –

What Jews felt in Nazi Germany is a different story altogether.
Charlotte Beradt secretly recorded people’s dreams in her diary and
later published them in a highly disconcerting book called the Third
Reich of Dreams. She describes how Jews themselves began believing in
the Nazi stereotypes about them. They dreamt of their hooked noses,
black hair and eyes, Jewish looks and body movements. The
stereotypical images publicised in the Nazi press haunted the Jews.
They troubled them even in their dreams. Jews died many deaths
even before they reached the gas chamber.

5.1 Knowledge about the Holocaust
India and the Contemporary World
Information about Nazi practices had trickled out of Germany
during the last years of the regime. But it was only after the war
ended and Germany was defeated that the world came to realise the
horrors of what had happened. While the Germans were preoccupied
with their own plight as a defeated nation emerging out of the rubble,
the Jews wanted the world to remember the atrocities and sufferings
they had endured during the Nazi killing operations – also called the
Holocaust. At its height, a ghetto inhabitant had said to another that
he wanted to outlive the war just for half an hour. Presumably he
meant that he wanted to be able to tell the world about what had
happened in Nazi Germany. This indomitable spirit to bear witness
and to preserve the documents can be seen in many ghetto and camp
inhabitants who wrote diaries, kept notebooks, and created archives.
On the other hand when the war seemed lost, the Nazi leadership
distributed petrol to its functionaries to destroy all incriminating
evidence available in offices.
Yet the history and the memory of the Holocaust live on in memoirs,
fiction, documentaries, poetry, memorials and museums in many
parts of the world today. These are a tribute to those who resisted it,
an embarrassing reminder to those who collaborated, and a warning
to those who watched in silence.

practically without money and obviously without the aid of science of
destruction which you have brought to such perfection. It is a marvel to
me that you do not see that it is nobody’s monopoly. If not the British,
some other power will certainly improve upon your method and beat you
with your own weapon. You are leaving no legacy to your people of

In Section II we will shift our focus to the study of livelihoods and economies. We
will look at how the lives of forest dwellers and pastoralists changed in the modern
world and how they played a part in shaping these changes.
All too often in looking at the emergence of the modern world, we only focus on
factories and cities, on the industrial and agricultural sectors which supply the market.
But we forget that there are other economies outside these sectors, other people too
who matter to the nation. To modern eyes, the lives of pastoralists and forest dwellers,
the shifting cultivators and food gatherers often seem to be stuck in the past. It is as
if their lives are not important when we study the emergence of the contemporary
world. The chapters in Section II will suggest that we need to know about their
lives, see how they organise their world and operate their economies. These
communities are very much part of the modern world we live in today. They are
not simply survivors from a bygone era.
Chapter IV will take you into the forest and tell you about the variety of ways the
forests were used by communities living within them. It will show how in the
nineteenth century the growth of industries and urban centres, ships and railways,
created a new demand on the forests for timber and other forest products. New
demands led to new rules of forest use, new ways of organising the forest. You will
see how colonial control was established over the forests, how forest areas were
mapped, trees were classified, and plantations were developed. All these developments
affected the lives of those local communities who used forest resources. They were
forced to operate within new systems and reorganise their lives. But they also rebelled
against the rules and persuaded the state to change its policies. The chapter will give
you an idea of the history of such developments in India and Indonesia.

1 Why Deforestation?
The disappearance of forests is referred to as deforestation.
Deforestation is not a recent problem. The process began many
centuries ago; but under colonial rule it became more systematic and
extensive. Let us look at some of the causes of deforestation in India.

1.1 Land to be Improved
India and the Contemporary World
In 1600, approximately one-sixth of India’s landmass was under
cultivation. Now that figure has gone up to about half. As population
increased over the centuries and the demand for food went up,
peasants extended the boundaries of cultivation, clearing forests and
breaking new land. In the colonial period, cultivation expanded
rapidly for a variety of reasons. First, the British directly encouraged
Fig.2 – When the valleys were full. Painting by John Dawson.
Native Americans like the Lakota tribe who lived in the Great North American Plains had a diversified economy. They
cultivated maize, foraged for wild plants and hunted bison. Keeping vast areas open for the bison to range in was seen by
the English settlers as wasteful. After the 1860s the bisons were killed in large numbers.

Box 1
The absence of cultivation in a place does not mean the land was
uninhabited. In Australia, when the white settlers landed, they
claimed that the continent was empty or terra nullius. In fact, they
were guided through the landscape by aboriginal tracks, and led
by aboriginal guides. The different aboriginal communities in
Australia had clearly demarcated territories. The Ngarrindjeri
people of Australia plotted their land along the symbolic body of
the first ancestor, Ngurunderi. This land included five different
environments: salt water, riverine tracts, lakes, bush and desert
plains, which satisfied different socio-economic needs.

production. Second, in the early nineteenth century, the colonial
state thought that forests were unproductive. They were considered
to be wilderness that had to be brought under cultivation so that
the land could yield agricultural products and revenue, and enhance
the income of the state. So between 1880 and 1920, cultivated area
rose by 6.7 million hectares.
We always see the expansion of cultivation as a sign of progress.
But we should not forget that for land to be brought under the
plough, forests have to be cleared.

In 1896 the American writer, Richard
Harding, wrote on the Honduras in
Central America:
‘There is no more interesting question of
the present day than that of what is to
be done with the world’s land which is
lying unimproved; whether it shall go to
the great power that is willing to turn it
to account, or remain with its original
owner, who fails to understand its value.
The Central Americans are like a gang of
semi-barbarians in a beautifully furnished
house, of which they can understand
neither its possibilities of comfort nor its
use.’
Three years later the American-owned
United Fruit Company was founded, and
grew bananas on an industrial scale in
Central America. The company acquired
such power over the governments of
these countries that they came to be
known as Banana Republics.
Quoted in David Spurr, The Rhetoric of
Empire, (1993).

1.2 Sleepers on the Tracks
By the early nineteenth century, oak forests in England were
disappearing. This created a problem of timber supply for the Royal
Navy. How could English ships be built without a regular supply of
strong and durable timber? How could imperial power be protected
and maintained without ships? By the 1820s, search parties were
sent to explore the forest resources of India. Within a decade, trees
were being felled on a massive scale and vast quantities of timber
were being exported from India.
The spread of railways from the 1850s created a new demand.
Railways were essential for colonial trade and for the movement of
imperial troops. To run locomotives, wood was needed as fuel, and
to lay railway lines sleepers were essential to hold the tracks together.
Each mile of railway track required between 1,760 and 2,000 sleepers.

about 25,500 km of track had been laid. In 1946, the length of the
tracks had increased to over 765,000 km. As the railway tracks spread
through India, a larger and larger number of trees were felled. As
early as the 1850s, in the Madras Presidency alone, 35,000 trees were
being cut annually for sleepers. The government gave out contracts
to individuals to supply the required quantities. These contractors
began cutting trees indiscriminately. Forests around the railway tracks
fast started disappearing.

‘The new line to be constructed was the Indus Valley Railway
between Multan and Sukkur, a distance of nearly 300 miles. At
the rate of 2000 sleepers per mile this would require 600,000
sleepers 10 feet by 10 inches by 5 inches (or 3.5 cubic feet
apiece), being upwards of 2,000,000 cubic feet. The
locomotives would use wood fuel. At the rate of one train daily
either way and at one maund per train-mile an annual supply
of 219,000 maunds would be demanded. In addition a large
supply of fuel for brick-burning would be required. The sleepers
would have to come mainly from the Sind Forests. The fuel
from the tamarisk and Jhand forests of Sind and the Punjab.
The other new line was the Northern State Railway from Lahore
to Multan. It was estimated that 2,200,000 sleepers would be
required for its construction.’
Each mile of railway track required between
1,760 and 2,000 sleepers. If one averagesized tree yields 3 to 5 sleepers for a 3 metre
wide broad gauge track, calculate
approximately how many trees would have to
be cut to lay one mile of track.

Large areas of natural forests were also cleared to make way for

These areas were enclosed and cleared of forests, and planted with

2 The Rise of Commercial Forestry
In the previous section we have seen that the British needed forests
in order to build ships and railways. The British were worried that
the use of forests by local people and the reckless felling of trees by
traders would destroy forests. So they decided to invite a German
expert, Dietrich Brandis, for advice, and made him the first Inspector
General of Forests in India.
Brandis realised that a proper system had to be introduced to manage
the forests and people had to be trained in the science of conservation.
This system would need legal sanction. Rules about the use of forest
resources had to be framed. Felling of trees and grazing had to be
restricted so that forests could be preserved for timber production.
Anybody who cut trees without following the system had to be

punished. So Brandis set up the Indian Forest Service in 1864 and
helped formulate the Indian Forest Act of 1865. The Imperial Forest
Research Institute was set up at Dehradun in 1906. The system they
taught here was called ‘scientific forestry’. Many people now,
including ecologists, feel that this system is not scientific at all.

India and the Contemporary World
In scientific forestry, natural forests which had lots of different types
of trees were cut down. In their place, one type of tree was planted
in straight rows. This is called a plantation. Forest officials surveyed
the forests, estimated the area under different types of trees, and
made working plans for forest management. They planned how much
of the plantation area to cut every year. The area cut was then to be
replanted so that it was ready to be cut again in some years.
After the Forest Act was enacted in 1865, it was amended twice,
once in 1878 and then in 1927. The 1878 Act divided forests into
three categories: reserved, protected and village forests. The best
forests were called ‘reserved forests’. Villagers could not take anything
from these forests, even for their own use. For house building or
fuel, they could take wood from protected or village forests.

Villagers wake up before dawn and go to the forest to collect the mahua flowers which have fallen on the forest floor. Mahua
trees are precious. Mahua flowers can be eaten or used to make alcohol. The seeds can be used to make oil.

In forest areas, people use forest products – roots, leaves, fruits, and
tubers – for many things. Fruits and tubers are nutritious to eat,
especially during the monsoons before the harvest has come in. Herbs
are used for medicine, wood for agricultural implements like yokes
and ploughs, bamboo makes excellent fences and is also used to make
baskets and umbrellas. A dried scooped-out gourd can be used as a
portable water bottle. Almost everything is available in the forest –
leaves can be stitched together to make disposable plates and cups,
the siadi (Bauhinia vahlii) creeper can be used to make ropes, and the
thorny bark of the semur (silk-cotton) tree is used to grate vegetables.
Oil for cooking and to light lamps can be pressed from the fruit of

from the forests, and if they were caught, they were at the mercy of
the forest guards who would take bribes from them. Women who
collected fuelwood were especially worried. It was also common for
police constables and forest guards to harass people by demanding
free food from them.

2.2 How did Forest Rules Affect Cultivation?
One of the major impacts of European colonialism was on the practice
of shifting cultivation or swidden agriculture. This is a traditional
agricultural practice in many parts of Asia, Africa and South America. It
has many local names such as lading in Southeast Asia, milpa in Central
America, chitemene or tavy in Africa, and chena in Sri Lanka. In
India, dhya, penda, bewar, nevad, jhum, podu, khandad and kumri
are some of the local terms for swidden agriculture.
In shifting cultivation, parts of the forest are cut and burnt in rotation.
Seeds are sown in the ashes after the first monsoon rains, and the crop is
harvested by October-November. Such plots are cultivated for a couple
of years and then left fallow for 12 to 18 years for the forest to grow
back. A mixture of crops is grown on these plots. In central India
and Africa it could be millets, in Brazil manioc, and in other parts of
Latin America maize and beans.
European foresters regarded this practice as harmful for the forests. They
felt that land which was used for cultivation every few years could not
grow trees for railway timber. When a forest was burnt, there was
the added danger of the flames spreading and burning valuable timber.

Fig.16 – Burning the forest penda or podu plot.
In shifting cultivation, a clearing is made in the forest, usually on the slopes of hills.
After the trees have been cut, they are burnt to provide ashes. The seeds are then
scattered in the area, and left to be irrigated by the rain.

Shifting cultivation also made it harder for the government to calculate
taxes. Therefore, the government decided to ban shifting cultivation.
As a result, many communities were forcibly displaced from their
homes in the forests. Some had to change occupations, while some
resisted through large and small rebellions.

The new forest laws changed the lives of forest dwellers in yet another
way. Before the forest laws, many people who lived in or near forests
had survived by hunting deer, partridges and a variety of small
animals. This customary practice was prohibited by the forest laws.
Those who were caught hunting were now punished for poaching.
While the forest laws deprived people of their customary rights to
hunt, hunting of big game became a sport. In India, hunting of tigers
and other animals had been part of the culture of the court and
nobility for centuries. Many Mughal paintings show princes and
emperors enjoying a hunt. But under colonial rule the scale of hunting
increased to such an extent that various species became almost extinct.
The British saw large animals as signs of a wild, primitive and savage
society. They believed that by killing dangerous animals the British

2.4 New Trades, New Employments and New Services
While people lost out in many ways after the forest department
took control of the forests, some people benefited from the new
opportunities that had opened up in trade. Many communities left
their traditional occupations and started trading in forest products.
This happened not only in India but across the world. For example,

Gadgil and Ramachandra Guha, This
Fissured Land: An Ecological History of
India.

In India, the trade in forest products was not new. From the medieval
period onwards, we have records of adivasi communities trading
elephants and other goods like hides, horns, silk cocoons, ivory,
bamboo, spices, fibres, grasses, gums and resins through nomadic
communities like the Banjaras.
With the coming of the British, however, trade was completely
regulated by the government. The British government gave many
large European trading firms the sole right to trade in the forest
products of particular areas. Grazing and hunting by local people
were restricted. In the process, many pastoralist and nomadic
communities like the Korava, Karacha and Yerukula of the Madras
Presidency lost their livelihoods. Some of them began to be called
‘criminal tribes’, and were forced to work instead in factories,
mines and plantations, under government supervision.
New opportunities of work did not always mean improved wellbeing for the people. In Assam, both men and women from forest
communities like Santhals and Oraons from Jharkhand, and
Gonds from Chhattisgarh were recruited to work on tea
plantations. Their wages were low and conditions of work were
very bad. They could not return easily to their home villages
from where they had been recruited.

Putumayo output of 4000 tons of rubber
was associated with a decrease of some
30,000 among the Indian population due
to torture, disease and flight. A letter
by an employee of a rubber company
describes how the rubber was collected.
The manager summoned hundreds of
Indians to the station:

3 Rebellion in the Forest
In many parts of India, and across the world, forest communities
rebelled against the changes that were being imposed on them. The
leaders of these movements against the British like Siddhu and Kanu
in the Santhal Parganas, Birsa Munda of Chhotanagpur or Alluri
Sitarama Raju of Andhra Pradesh are still remembered today in songs
and stories. We will now discuss in detail one such rebellion which
took place in the kingdom of Bastar in 1910.

3.1 The People of Bastar
Bastar is located in the southernmost part of Chhattisgarh and
borders Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Maharashtra. The central part
of Bastar is on a plateau. To the north of this plateau is the
Chhattisgarh plain and to its south is the Godavari plain. The river
Indrawati winds across Bastar east to west. A number of different
communities live in Bastar such as Maria and Muria Gonds, Dhurwas,
Bhatras and Halbas. They speak different languages but share
common customs and beliefs. The people of Bastar believe that each
village was given its land by the Earth, and in return, they look after

Dantewada. In 2001, these became part of
Chhattisgarh. The 1910 rebellion first started
in the Kanger forest area (encircled) and soon
spread to other parts of the state.

the earth by making some offerings at each agricultural festival. In
addition to the Earth, they show respect to the spirits of the river,
the forest and the mountain. Since each village knows where its
boundaries lie, the local people look after all the natural resources
within that boundary. If people from a village want to take some
wood from the forests of another village, they pay a small fee called
devsari, dand or man in exchange. Some villages also protect their forests
by engaging watchmen and each household contributes some grain
to pay them. Every year there is one big hunt where the headmen of
villages in a pargana (cluster of villages) meet and discuss issues of
concern, including forests.

3.2 The Fears of the People
People began to gather and discuss these issues in their village councils,
in bazaars and at festivals or wherever the headmen and priests of
several villages were assembled. The initiative was taken by the
Dhurwas of the Kanger forest, where reservation first took place.
Although there was no single leader, many people speak of Gunda
Dhur, from village Nethanar, as an important figure in the
movement. In 1910, mango boughs, a lump of earth, chillies and
arrows, began circulating between villages. These were actually
messages inviting villagers to rebel against the British. Every village
contributed something to the rebellion expenses. Bazaars were looted,
the houses of officials and traders, schools and police stations were
burnt and robbed, and grain redistributed. Most of those who were
attacked were in some way associated with the colonial state and its
oppressive laws. William Ward, a missionary who observed the events,
wrote: ‘From all directions came streaming into Jagdalpur, police,
merchants, forest peons, schoolmasters and immigrants.’

constables of the State reserve police

not maltreat the guard seriously but
eased them of their weapons and let

to block the passage there in case the
Dewan left the main road. The rest went
on to Dilmilli to stop the main road from
Bijapur. Buddhu Majhi and Harchand Naik

Forest Society and Colonialism
When the colonial government proposed to reserve two-thirds of
the forest in 1905, and stop shifting cultivation, hunting and collection
of forest produce, the people of Bastar were very worried. Some
villages were allowed to stay on in the reserved forests on the condition
that they worked free for the forest department in cutting and
transporting trees, and protecting the forest from fires. Subsequently,
these came to be known as ‘forest villages’. People of other villages
were displaced without any notice or compensation. For long,
villagers had been suffering from increased land rents and frequent
demands for free labour and goods by colonial officials. Then came
the terrible famines, in 1899-1900 and again in 1907-1908. Reservations
proved to be the last straw.

Elders living in Bastar recounted the story of this battle they had heard
from their parents:
Podiyami Ganga of Kankapal was told by his father Podiyami Tokeli that:
‘The British came and started taking land. The Raja didn’t pay attention
to things happening around him, so seeing that land was being taken,
his supporters gathered people. War started. His staunch supporters
died and the rest were whipped. My father, Podiyami Tokeli suffered many
strokes, but he escaped and survived. It was a movement to get rid of
the British. The British used to tie them to horses and pull them. From
every village two or three people went to Jagdalpur: Gargideva and
Michkola of Chidpal, Dole and Adrabundi of Markamiras, Vadapandu of
Baleras, Unga of Palem and many others.’
India and the Contemporary World
‘On the people’s side, were the big elders – Mille Mudaal of Palem, Soyekal
Dhurwa of Nandrasa, and Pandwa Majhi. People from every pargana
camped in Alnar tarai. The paltan (force) surrounded the people in a
flash. Gunda Dhur had flying powers and flew away. But what could those
with bows and arrows do? The battle took place at night. The people hid
in shrubs and crawled away. The army paltan also ran away. All those
who remained alive (of the people), somehow found their way home to
their villages.’
The British sent troops to suppress the rebellion. The adivasi leaders
tried to negotiate, but the British surrounded their camps and fired
upon them. After that they marched through the villages flogging
and punishing those who had taken part in the rebellion. Most
villages were deserted as people fled into the jungles. It took three
months (February - May) for the British to regain control. However,
they never managed to capture Gunda Dhur. In a major victory
for the rebels, work on reservation was temporarily suspended,
and the area to be reserved was reduced to roughly half of that
planned before 1910.
The story of the forests and people of Bastar does not end there.
After Independence, the same practice of keeping people out of the
forests and reserving them for industrial use continued. In the 1970s,
the World Bank proposed that 4,600 hectares of natural sal forest
should be replaced by tropical pine to provide pulp for the paper
industry. It was only after protests by local environmentalists that
the project was stopped.
Let us now go to another part of Asia, Indonesia, and see what was
happening there over the same period.

4 Forest Transformations in Java
Java is now famous as a rice-producing island in Indonesia. But
once upon a time it was covered mostly with forests. The colonial
power in Indonesia were the Dutch, and as we will see, there were
many similarities in the laws for forest control in Indonesia and
India. Java in Indonesia is where the Dutch started forest
management. Like the British, they wanted timber from Java to
build ships. In 1600, the population of Java was an estimated 3.4
million. There were many villages in the fertile plains, but there
were also many communities living in the mountains and practising
shifting cultivation.

4.1 The Woodcutters of Java
The Kalangs of Java were a community of skilled forest cutters and
shifting cultivators. They were so valuable that in 1755 when the
Mataram kingdom of Java split, the 6,000 Kalang families were
equally divided between the two kingdoms. Without their expertise,
it would have been difficult to harvest teak and for the kings to
build their palaces. When the Dutch began to gain control over the
forests in the eighteenth century, they tried to make the Kalangs
work under them. In 1770, the Kalangs resisted by attacking a Dutch
fort at Joana, but the uprising was suppressed.

shipbuilding and railways led to the
Forest Society and Colonialism
In the nineteenth century, when it became
important to control territory and not just
people, the Dutch enacted forest laws in Java,
restricting villagers’ access to forests. Now
wood could only be cut for specified purposes
like making river boats or constructing houses,
and only from specific forests under close
supervision. Villagers were punished for
grazing cattle in young stands, transporting
wood without a permit, or travelling on forest
roads with horse carts or cattle.

introduction of a forest service. In 1882, 280,000 sleepers were
exported from Java alone. However, all this required labour to cut
the trees, transport the logs and prepare the sleepers. The Dutch
first imposed rents on land being cultivated in the forest and then
exempted some villages from these rents if they worked collectively
to provide free labour and buffaloes for cutting and transporting
timber. This was known as the blandongdiensten system. Later, instead
of rent exemption, forest villagers were given small wages, but their
right to cultivate forest land was restricted.

4.3 Samin’s Challenge
Dirk van Hogendorp, an official of the
United East India Company in colonial
Java said:
‘Batavians! Be amazed! Hear with
wonder what I have to communicate. Our
fleets are destroyed, our trade
languishes, our navigation is going to
ruin – we purchase with immense
treasures, timber and other materials
for ship-building from the northern
powers, and on Java we leave warlike
and mercantile squadrons with their
roots in the ground. Yes, the forests of
Java have timber enough to build a
respectable navy in a short time, besides
as many merchant ships as we require
… In spite of all (the cutting) the forests
of Java grow as fast as they are cut,
and would be inexhaustible under good
care and management.’
Dirk van Hogendorp, cited in Peluso, Rich
Forests, Poor People, 1992.

India and the Contemporary World
Around 1890, Surontiko Samin of Randublatung village, a teak forest
village, began questioning state ownership of the forest. He argued that
the state had not created the wind, water, earth and wood, so it could not
own it. Soon a widespread movement developed. Amongst those who
helped organise it were Samin’s sons-in-law. By 1907, 3,000 families
were following his ideas. Some of the Saminists protested by lying down
on their land when the Dutch came to survey it, while others refused to
pay taxes or fines or perform labour.

4.4 War and Deforestation
The First World War and the Second World War had a major impact
on forests. In India, working plans were abandoned at this time, and
the forest department cut trees freely to meet British war needs. In
Java, just before the Japanese occupied the region, the Dutch followed
‘a scorched earth’ policy, destroying sawmills, and burning huge
piles of giant teak logs so that they would not fall into Japanese
hands. The Japanese then exploited the forests recklessly for their
own war industries, forcing forest villagers to cut down forests.
Many villagers used this opportunity to expand cultivation in the
forest. After the war, it was difficult for the Indonesian forest service
to get this land back. As in India, people’s need for agricultural land
has brought them into conflict with the forest department’s desire
to control the land and exclude people from it.

The forest department cut freely to satisfy war
needs.

4.5 New Developments in Forestry
Forest Society and Colonialism
Since the 1980s, governments across Asia and Africa have begun to
see that scientific forestry and the policy of keeping forest
communities away from forests has resulted in many conflicts.
Conservation of forests rather than collecting timber has become a
more important goal. The government has recognised that in order
to meet this goal, the people who live near the forests must be
involved. In many cases, across India, from Mizoram to Kerala, dense
forests have survived only because villages protected them in sacred
groves known as sarnas, devarakudu, kan, rai, etc. Some villages have
been patrolling their own forests, with each household taking it in
turns, instead of leaving it to the forest guards. Local forest
communities and environmentalists today are thinking of different
forms of forest management.

Fig.1 – Sheep grazing on the Bugyals of eastern Garhwal.
Bugyals are vast natural pastures on the high mountains, above 12,000 feet. They are under snow in the winter and
come to life after April. At this time the entire mountainside is covered with a variety of grasses, roots and herbs.
By monsoon, these pastures are thick with vegetation and carpeted with wild flowers.

In this chapter you will read about nomadic pastoralists. Nomads
are people who do not live in one place but move from one area to
another to earn their living. In many parts of India we can see nomadic
pastoralists on the move with their herds of goats and sheep, or
camels and cattle. Have you ever wondered where they are coming
from and where they are headed? Do you know how they live and
earn? What their past has been?
Pastoralists rarely enter the pages of history textbooks. When you
read about the economy – whether in your classes of history or
economics – you learn about agriculture and industry. Sometimes
you read about artisans; but rarely about pastoralists. As if their
lives do not matter. As if they are figures from the past who have no
place in modern society.
In this chapter you will see how pastoralism has been important in
societies like India and Africa. You will read about the way
colonialism impacted their lives, and how they have coped with the
pressures of modern society. The chapter will first focus on India
and then Africa.

1.1 In the Mountains
Source A
Even today the Gujjar Bakarwals of Jammu and Kashmir are great
herders of goat and sheep. Many of them migrated to this region in
the nineteenth century in search of pastures for their animals.
Gradually, over the decades, they established themselves in the area,
and moved annually between their summer and winter grazing
grounds. In winter, when the high mountains were covered with
snow, they lived with their herds in the low hills of the Siwalik
range. The dry scrub forests here provided pasture for their herds.
By the end of April they began their northern march for their summer
grazing grounds. Several households came together for this journey,
forming what is known as a kafila. They crossed the Pir Panjal passes
and entered the valley of Kashmir. With the onset of summer, the
snow melted and the mountainsides were lush green. The variety of
grasses that sprouted provided rich nutritious forage for the animal
herds. By end September the Bakarwals were on the move again, this
time on their downward journey, back to their winter base. When
the high mountains were covered with snow, the herds were grazed
in the low hills.

India and the Contemporary World
In a different area of the mountains, the Gaddi shepherds of
Himachal Pradesh had a similar cycle of seasonal movement. They
too spent their winter in the low hills of Siwalik range, grazing their
flocks in scrub forests. By April they moved north and spent the
summer in Lahul and Spiti. When the snow melted and the high
passes were clear, many of them moved on to higher mountain
Writing in the 1850s, G.C. Barnes gave
the following description of the Gujjars
of Kangra:
‘In the hills the Gujjars are exclusively
a pastoral tribe – they cultivate scarcely
at all. The Gaddis keep flocks of sheep
and goats and the Gujjars, wealth
consists of buffaloes. These people live
in the skirts of the forests, and maintain
their existence exclusively by the sale
of the milk, ghee, and other produce
of their herds. The men graze the
cattle, and frequently lie out for weeks
in the woods tending their herds. The
women repair to the markets every
morning with baskets on their heads,
with little earthen pots filled with milk,
butter-milk and ghee, each of these
pots containing the proportion required
for a day’s meal. During the hot
weather the Gujjars usually drive their
herds to the upper range, where the
buffaloes rejoice in the rich grass which
the rains bring forth and at the same
time attain condition from the
temperate climate and the immunity
from venomous flies that torment their
existence in the plains.’

of Kangra, 1850-55.

Further to the east, in Garhwal and Kumaon, the Gujjar cattle herders
came down to the dry forests of the bhabar in the
winter, and went up to the high meadows – the
bugyals – in summer. Many of them were
originally from Jammu and came to the UP hills in
the nineteenth century in search of good pastures.
This pattern of cyclical movement between summer
and winter pastures was typical of many pastoral
communities of the Himalayas, including the
Bhotiyas, Sherpas and Kinnauris. All of them had
to adjust to seasonal changes and make effective use
of available pastures in different places. When the
pasture was exhausted or unusable in one place they
moved their herds and flock to new areas. This
continuous movement also allowed the pastures to
recover; it prevented their overuse.

way they stopped once again in the villages of Lahul and Spiti, reaping
their summer harvest and sowing their winter crop. Then they descended
with their flock to their winter grazing ground on the Siwalik hills.
Next April, once again, they began their march with their goats and
sheep, to the summer meadows.

1.2 On the Plateaus, Plains and Deserts
Not all pastoralists operated in the mountains. They were also to be
found in the plateaus, plains and deserts of India.

India and the Contemporary World
Dhangars were an important pastoral community of Maharashtra.
In the early twentieth century their population in this region was
estimated to be 467,000. Most of them were shepherds, some were
blanket weavers, and still others were buffalo herders. The Dhangar
shepherds stayed in the central plateau of Maharashtra during the
monsoon. This was a semi-arid region with low rainfall and poor
soil. It was covered with thorny scrub. Nothing but dry crops like
bajra could be sown here. In the monsoon this tract became a vast
grazing ground for the Dhangar flocks. By October the Dhangars
harvested their bajra and started on their move west. After a march
of about a month they reached the Konkan. This was a flourishing
agricultural tract with high rainfall and rich soil. Here the shepherds

were welcomed by Konkani peasants. After the kharif harvest was
cut at this time, the fields had to be fertilised and made ready for the
rabi harvest. Dhangar flocks manured the fields and fed on the
stubble. The Konkani peasants also gave supplies of rice which the
shepherds took back to the plateau where grain was scarce. With the
onset of the monsoon the Dhangars left the Konkan and the coastal
areas with their flocks and returned to their settlements on the dry
plateau. The sheep could not tolerate the wet monsoon conditions.

In Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, again, the dry central plateau was
covered with stone and grass, inhabited by cattle, goat and sheep
herders. The Gollas herded cattle. The Kurumas and Kurubas reared
sheep and goats and sold woven blankets. They lived near the woods,
cultivated small patches of land, engaged in a variety of petty trades
and took care of their herds. Unlike the mountain pastoralists, it
was not the cold and the snow that defined the seasonal rhythms of
their movement: rather it was the alternation of the monsoon and
dry season. In the dry season they moved to the coastal tracts, and
left when the rains came. Only buffaloes liked the swampy, wet
conditions of the coastal areas during the monsoon months. Other
herds had to be shifted to the dry plateau at this time.
Banjaras were yet another well-known group of graziers. They were
to be found in the villages of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan,
Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In search of good pastureland
for their cattle, they moved over long distances, selling plough cattle
and other goods to villagers in exchange for grain and fodder.

The accounts of many travellers tell us about the life of pastoral
groups. In the early nineteenth century, Buchanan visited the
Gollas during his travel through Mysore. He wrote:
‘Their families live in small villages near the skirt of the woods,
where they cultivate a little ground, and keep some of their
cattle, selling in the towns the produce of the dairy.
Their families are very numerous, seven to eight young men in
each being common. Two or three of these attend the flocks in
the woods, while the remainder cultivate their fields, and supply
the towns with firewood, and with straw for thatch.’

live on the edges of forests?

Pastoralists in the Modern World
In the deserts of Rajasthan lived the Raikas. The rainfall in
the region was meagre and uncertain. On cultivated land,
harvests fluctuated every year. Over vast stretches no crop
could be grown. So the Raikas combined cultivation with
pastoralism. During the monsoons, the Raikas of Barmer,
Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Bikaner stayed in their home villages,
where pasture was available. By October, when these grazing
grounds were dry and exhausted, they moved out in search
of other pasture and water, and returned again during the
next monsoon. One group of Raikas – known as the Maru
(desert) Raikas – herded camels and another group reared
sheep and goat.

So we see that the life of these pastoral groups was sustained by a
careful consideration of a host of factors. They had to judge how
long the herds could stay in one area, and know where they could
find water and pasture. They needed to calculate the timing of their
movements, and ensure that they could move through different
territories. They had to set up a relationship with farmers on the
way, so that the herds could graze in harvested fields and manure the
soil. They combined a range of different activities – cultivation, trade,
and herding – to make their living.

2 Colonial R ule and P astoral L ife
Under colonial rule, the life of pastoralists changed dramatically.
Their grazing grounds shrank, their movements were regulated,
and the revenue they had to pay increased. Their agricultural stock
declined and their trades and crafts were adversely affected. How?

India and the Contemporary World
First, the colonial state wanted to transform all grazing lands
into cultivated farms. Land revenue was one of the main sources
of its finance. By expanding cultivation it could increase its revenue
collection. It could at the same time produce more jute, cotton,
wheat and other agricultural produce that were required in
England. To colonial officials all uncultivated land appeared to
be unproductive: it produced neither revenue nor agricultural
produce. It was seen as ‘waste land’ that needed to be brought
under cultivation. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste Land
Rules were enacted in various parts of the country. By these Rules
uncultivated lands were taken over and given to select individuals.
These individuals were granted various concessions and encouraged
to settle these lands. Some of them were made headmen of villages
in the newly cleared areas. In most areas the lands taken over
were actually grazing tracts used regularly by pastoralists. So
expansion of cultivation inevitably meant the decline of pastures
and a problem for pastoralists.
Second, by the mid-nineteenth century, various Forest Acts were
also being enacted in the different provinces. Through these Acts
some forests which produced commercially valuable timber like
deodar or sal were declared ‘Reserved’. No pastoralist was allowed
access to these forests. Other forests were classified as ‘Protected’.
In these, some customary grazing rights of pastoralists were
granted but their movements were severely restricted. The
colonial officials believed that grazing destroyed the saplings and
young shoots of trees that germinated on the forest floor. The
herds trampled over the saplings and munched away the shoots.
This prevented new trees from growing.
These Forest Acts changed the lives of pastoralists. They were
now prevented from entering many forests that had earlier
provided valuable forage for their cattle. Even in the areas they
were allowed entry, their movements were regulated. They needed
a permit for entry. The timing of their entry and departure was

Third, British officials were suspicious of nomadic people. They
distrusted mobile craftsmen and traders who hawked their goods
in villages, and pastoralists who changed their places of residence
every season, moving in search of good pastures for their herds.
The colonial government wanted to rule over a settled population.
They wanted the rural people to live in villages, in fixed places
with fixed rights on particular fields. Such a population was easy
to identify and control. Those who were settled were seen as
peaceable and law abiding; those who were nomadic were
considered to be criminal. In 1871, the colonial government in
India passed the Criminal Tribes Act. By this Act many
communities of craftsmen, traders and pastoralists were classified
as Criminal Tribes. They were stated to be criminal by nature
and birth. Once this Act came into force, these communities were
expected to live only in notified village settlements. They were
not allowed to move out without a permit. The village police
kept a continuous watch on them.
Fourth, to expand its revenue income, the colonial government
looked for every possible source of taxation. So tax was imposed
on land, on canal water, on salt, on trade goods, and even on
animals. Pastoralists had to pay tax on every animal they grazed
on the pastures. In most pastoral tracts of India, grazing tax was
introduced in the mid-nineteenth century. The tax per head of
cattle went up rapidly and the system of collection was made
increasingly efficient. In the decades between the 1850s and 1880s
the right to collect the tax was auctioned out to contractors. These
contractors tried to extract as high a tax as they could to recover
the money they had paid to the state and earn as much profit as
they could within the year. By the 1880s the government began
collecting taxes directly from the pastoralists. Each of them was
given a pass. To enter a grazing tract, a cattle herder had to show
the pass and pay the tax. The number of cattle heads he had and
the amount of tax he paid was entered on the pass.

In the 1920s, a Royal Commission on
Agriculture reported:
‘The extent of the area available for
grazing has gone down tremendously
with the extension of area under
cultivation because of increasing
population, extension of irrigation
facilities, acquiring the pastures for
Government purposes, for example,
defence, industries and agricultural
experimental farms. [Now] breeders find
it difficult to raise large herds. Thus their
earnings have gone down. The quality
of their livestock has deteriorated,
dietary standards have fallen and
indebtedness has increased.’

Agriculture in India, 1928.

specified, and the number of days they could spend in the forest
was limited. Pastoralists could no longer remain in an area even if
forage was available, the grass was succulent and the undergrowth
in the forest was ample. They had to move because the Forest
Department permits that had been issued to them now ruled their
lives. The permit specified the periods in which they could be
legally within a forest. If they overstayed they were liable to fines.

2.1 How Did these Changes Affect the Lives of Pastoralists?
These measures led to a serious shortage of pastures. When grazing
lands were taken over and turned into cultivated fields, the available
area of pastureland declined. Similarly, the reservation of forests
meant that shepherds and cattle herders could no longer freely pasture
their cattle in the forests.

India and the Contemporary World
As pasturelands disappeared under the plough, the existing animal
stock had to feed on whatever grazing land remained. This led to
continuous intensive grazing of these pastures. Usually nomadic
pastoralists grazed their animals in one area and moved to another
area. These pastoral movements allowed time for the natural
restoration of vegetation growth. When restrictions were imposed
on pastoral movements, grazing lands came to be continuously used
and the quality of patures declined. This in turn created a further
shortage of forage for animals and the deterioration of animal stock.
Underfed cattle died in large numbers during scarcities and famines.

106
Reprint 2025-26
2.2 How Did the Pastoralists Cope with these Changes?
Pastoralists reacted to these changes in a variety of ways. Some
reduced the number of cattle in their herds, since there was not
enough pasture to feed large numbers. Others discovered new
pastures when movement to old grazing grounds became difficult.
After 1947, the camel and sheep herding Raikas, for instance, could
no longer move into Sindh and graze their camels on the banks of
the Indus, as they had done earlier. The new political boundaries
between India and Pakistan stopped their movement. So they had
to find new places to go. In recent years they have been migrating
to Haryana where sheep can graze on agricultural fields after the
harvests are cut. This is the time that the fields need manure that
the animals provide.
Over the years, some richer pastoralists began buying land and
settling down, giving up their nomadic life. Some became settled
peasants cultivating land, others took to more extensive trading.
Many poor pastoralists, on the other hand, borrowed money from
moneylenders to survive. At times they lost their cattle and sheep
and became labourers, working on fields or in small towns.
Yet, pastoralists not only continue to survive, in many regions
their numbers have expanded over recent decades. When
pasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed the
direction of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combined
pastoral activity with other forms of income and adapted to the
changes in the modern world. Many ecologists believe that in dry
regions and in the mountains, pastoralism is still ecologically the
most viable form of life.

Reprint 2025-26
Pastoralists in the Modern World
Such changes were not experienced only by pastoral communities
in India. In many other parts of the world, new laws and settlement
patterns forced pastoral communities to alter their lives. How did
pastoral communities elsewhere cope with these changes in the
modern world?

3 Pastoralism in Africa
Let us move to Africa where over half the world’s pastoral population
lives. Even today, over 22 million Africans depend on some form of
pastoral activity for their livelihood. They include communities like
Bedouins, Berbers, Maasai, Somali, Boran and Turkana. Most of
them now live in the semi-arid grasslands or arid deserts where rainfed
agriculture is difficult. They raise cattle, camels, goats, sheep and
donkeys; and they sell milk, meat, animal skin and wool. Some also
earn through trade and transport, others combine pastoral activity
with agriculture; still others do a variety of odd jobs to supplement
their meagre and uncertain earnings from pastoralism.

India and the Contemporary World
Like pastoralists in India, the lives of African pastoralists have changed
dramatically over the colonial and post-colonial periods. What have
these changes been?

3.1 Where have the Grazing Lands Gone?
One of the problems the Maasais have faced is the continuous loss of
their grazing lands. Before colonial times, Maasailand stretched over
a vast area from north Kenya to the steppes of northern Tanzania.
In the late nineteenth century, European imperial powers scrambled
for territorial possessions in Africa, slicing up the region into different
colonies. In 1885, Maasailand was cut into half with an international
boundary between British Kenya and German Tanganyika.
Subsequently, the best grazing lands were gradually taken over for
white settlement and the Maasai were pushed into a small area in

Pastoralists in the Modern World
We will discuss some of these changes by looking at one pastoral
community – the Maasai – in some detail. The Maasai cattle herders
live primarily in east Africa: 300, 000 in southern Kenya and another

away their land and restricted their movement. This affected their
lives in times of drought and even reshaped their social relationships.

south Kenya and north Tanzania. The Maasai lost about 60 per cent
of their pre-colonial lands. They were confined to an arid zone with
uncertain rainfall and poor pastures.
From the late nineteenth century, the British colonial government
in east Africa also encouraged local peasant communities to expand
cultivation. As cultivation expanded, pasturelands were turned into
cultivated fields. In pre-colonial times, the Maasai pastoralists had
dominated their agricultural neighbours both economically and
politically. By the end of colonial rule the situation had reversed.

India and the Contemporary World
Large areas of grazing land were also turned into game reserves like
the Maasai Mara and Samburu National Park in Kenya and Serengeti
Park in Tanzania. Pastoralists were not allowed to enter these
reserves; they could neither hunt animals nor graze their herds in
these areas. Very often these reserves were in areas that had
traditionally been regular grazing grounds for Maasai herds. The
Serengeti National Park, for instance, was created over 14,760 km.
of Maasai grazing land.

Pastoralists in the Modern World
Pastoral communities elsewhere in Africa faced similar problems.
In Namibia, in south-west Africa, the Kaokoland herders
traditionally moved between Kaokoland and nearby
Ovamboland, and they sold skin, meat and other trade
products in neighbouring markets. All this was stopped with
the new system of territorial boundaries that restricted
movements between regions.
The nomadic cattle herders of Kaokoland in Namibia
complained:
‘We have difficulty. We cry. We are imprisoned. We do not know
why we are locked up. We are in jail. We have no place to live
… We cannot get meat from the south … Our sleeping skins
cannot be sent out … Ovamboland is closed for us. We lived in
Ovamboland for a long time. We want to take our cattle there,
also our sheep and goats. The borders are closed. The borders
press us heavily. We cannot live.’

‘Passes to enter the Territory should not be given to these Natives unless
exceptional circumstances necessitate their entering … The object of the above
proclamation is to restrict the number of natives entering the Territory and to
keep a check on them, and ordinary visiting passes should therefore never be
issued to them.’
‘Kaokoveld permits to enter’, Magistrate to Police Station Commanders of Outjo
and Kamanjab, 24 November, 1937.

The loss of the finest grazing lands and water resources created
pressure on the small area of land that the Maasai were confined
within. Continuous grazing within a small area inevitably meant a
deterioration of the quality of pastures. Fodder was always in short
supply. Feeding the cattle became a persistent problem.

3.2 The Borders are Closed
India and the Contemporary World
In the nineteenth century, African pastoralists could move over vast
areas in search of pastures. When the pastures were exhausted in one
place they moved to a different area to graze their cattle. From the
late nineteenth century, the colonial government began imposing
various restrictions on their mobility.
Like the Maasai, other pastoral groups were also forced to live within
the confines of special reserves. The boundaries of these reserves
became the limits within which they could now move. They were
not allowed to move out with their stock without special permits.
And it was difficult to get permits without trouble and harassment.
Those found guilty of disobeying the rules were severely punished.
Pastoralists were also not allowed to enter the markets in white areas.
In many regions, they were prohibited from participating in any
form of trade. White settlers and European colonists saw pastoralists
as dangerous and savage – people with whom all contact had to be
minimised. Cutting off all links was, however, never really possible,
because white colonists had to depend on black labour to bore mines
and, build roads and towns.
The new territorial boundaries and restrictions imposed on them
suddenly changed the lives of pastoralists. This adversely affected

In most places in colonial Africa, the police were given instructions to keep a
watch on the movements of pastoralists, and prevent them from entering white
areas. The following is one such instruction given by a magistrate to the police,
in south-west Africa, restricting the movements of the pastoralists of Kaokoland
in Namibia:
both their pastoral and trading activities. Earlier, pastoralists not
only looked after animal herds but traded in various products. The
restrictions under colonial rule did not entirely stop their trading
activities but they were now subject to various restrictions.

3.3 When Pastures Dry
Drought affects the life of pastoralists everywhere. When rains fail
and pastures are dry, cattle are likely to starve unless they can be
moved to areas where forage is available. That is why, traditionally,
pastoralists are nomadic; they move from place to place. This
nomadism allows them to survive bad times and avoid crises.
But from the colonial period, the Maasai were bound down to a
fixed area, confined within a reserve, and prohibited from moving
in search of pastures. They were cut off from the best grazing lands
and forced to live within a semi-arid tract prone to frequent droughts.
Since they could not shift their cattle to places where pastures were
available, large numbers of Maasai cattle died of starvation and disease
in these years of drought. An enquiry in 1930 showed that the Maasai
in Kenya possessed 720,000 cattle, 820,000 sheep and 171,000 donkeys.
In just two years of severe drought, 1933 and 1934, over half the
cattle in the Maasai Reserve died.
As the area of grazing lands shrank, the adverse effect of the droughts
increased in intensity. The frequent bad years led to a steady decline
of the animal stock of the pastoralists.

In Maasailand, as elsewhere in Africa, not all pastoralists were equally
affected by the changes in the colonial period. In pre-colonial times
Maasai society was divided into two social categories – elders and
warriors. The elders formed the ruling group and met in periodic
councils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes.
The warriors consisted of younger people, mainly responsible for
the protection of the tribe. They defended the community and
organised cattle raids. Raiding was important in a society where cattle
was wealth. It is through raids that the power of different pastoral
groups was asserted. Young men came to be recognised as members
of the warrior class when they proved their manliness by raiding
the cattle of other pastoral groups and participating in wars. They,
however, were subject to the authority of the elders.

traditional deep red shukas, brightly beaded
Maasai jewelry and carry five-foot, steel tipped
spears. Their long pleats of intricately plaited
hair are tinted red with ochre. As per tradition
they face East to honour the rising sun.
Warriors are in charge of society's security
while boys are responsible for herding
livestock. During the drought season, both
warriors and boys assume responsibility for
herding livestock. Courtesy: The Massai Association.

Pastoralists in the Modern World
3.4 Not All were Equally Affected
Fig.17 - Even today, young men go through
an elaborate ritual before they become
warriors, although actually it is no longer
common. They must travel throughout the
section's region for about four months,
ending with an event where they run to the
homestead and enter with an attitude of a
raider. During the ceremony, boys dress in
loose clothing and dance non-stop throughout
the day. This ceremony is the transition into a
new age. Girls are not required to go through
such a ritual. Courtesy: The Massai Association.

India and the Contemporary World
To administer the affairs of the Maasai, the British introduced
a series of measures that had important implications. They
appointed chiefs of different sub-groups of Maasai, who were
made responsible for the affairs of the tribe. The British
imposed various restrictions on raiding and warfare.
Consequently, the traditional authority of both elders and
warriors was adversely affected.
The chiefs appointed by the colonial government often
accumulated wealth over time. They had a regular income with
which they could buy animals, goods and land. They lent
money to poor neighbours who needed cash to pay taxes. Many
of them began living in towns, and became involved in trade.
Their wives and children stayed back in the villages to look
after the animals. These chiefs managed to survive the
devastations of war and drought. They had both pastoral and
non-pastoral income, and could buy animals when their stock
was depleted.
But the life history of the poor pastoralists who depended only
on their livestock was different. Most often, they did not have
the resources to tide over bad times. In times of war and famine,
they lost nearly everything. They had to go looking for work
in the towns. Some eked out a living as charcoal burners, others
did odd jobs. The lucky could get more regular work in road
or building construction.
The social changes in Maasai society occurred at two levels.
First, the traditional difference based on age, between the elders

and warriors, was disturbed, though it did not break down
entirely. Second, a new distinction between the wealthy and poor
pastoralists developed.

Conclusion
So we see that pastoral communities in different parts of the world
are affected in a variety of different ways by changes in the modern
world. New laws and new borders affect the patterns of their
movement. With increasing restrictions on their mobility,
pastoralists find it difficult to move in search of pastures. As pasture
lands disappear grazing becomes a problem, while pastures that
remain deteriorate through continuous over grazing. Times of
drought become times of crises, when cattle die in large numbers.

Pastoralists in the Modern World
Yet, pastoralists do adapt to new times. They change the paths of
their annual movement, reduce their cattle numbers, press for rights
to enter new areas, exert political pressure on the government for
relief, subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in
the management of forests and water resources. Pastoralists are not
relics of the past. They are not people who have no place in the
modern world. Environmentalists and economists have increasingly
come to recognise that pastoral nomadism is a form of life that is
perfectly suited to many hilly and dry regions of the world.
