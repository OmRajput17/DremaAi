Badal was returning from

shivering in the cold.

Badal brought him home.
"Can this puppy stay with us,
Maa?" asked Badal. "Yes beta,
but only if you promise to take
care of the puppy", said his
mother with a smile. Badal
and his mother named the
puppy Moti. As days went by,
Moti grew up and loved Badal.
They became best friends.
They ate and played together.
Moti followed Badal wherever.
he went. They played their
favourite games together.
16 Santoor | Class 3
One rainy day, while Badal was
on his way home from school, he
slipped on the muddy lane and
fell into a deep pit. He tried hard,
but could not come out of the
pit. Badal's mother was worried
when he did not come home in
time. Moti too was waiting at the
gate. Badal's mother gathered
the neighbours to help search for
him. Moti too accompanied them.
Moti caught Badal's
scent. He followed the scent
and went near the pit and
started barking. This alerted
the neighbours who were
searching for Badal. They
used a rope to pull Badal
out of the pit. Everyone was
relieved. Badal hugged and
thanked Moti.

However, he continued to

One night, he was very upset. He began
to cry. "Ooohh... Ooohh... What is this?
I am never able to complete my counting."
On seeing his tears, the Sun smiled,
"Don't worry! Why do you cry? I can tell
you how many stars there are in the sky."
"Really? How many?" Chanda Mama was
surprised.
The Sun replied joyfully, "The number
of lovely children is the same as the
number of stars in the sky."
Chanda Mama was happy! Now, the
Moon came out every night. He would look
at the stars. He would look at the children and
he would smile happily.

The crayons are there in the big box.

The underlined words in both sentences tell us about
the location of 'sharpener' and 'crayons'. The distance
of the objects from the speaker helps us in choosing
between the words 'here' and 'there'.
We use 'here' to tell the location of things that are near
us. Similarly, 'there' is used to tell the location of things
that are far from us.

Pratik replied that
his friend Vivaan's

a scientist. "Shall we go

Pratik. Rani happily
