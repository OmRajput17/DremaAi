Going to School
Let us meet some children and see how they reach school.
Bamboo Bridge
Try these
It rains so much where we live.
Sometimes after the rain, there
is knee-high water everywhere.
But that does not stop us from
getting to school. We hold our
books in one hand and bamboo
with the other. We quickly cross
the bamboo and rope bridge to
reach school.
Collect some bricks. Lay them
on the ground in a line as
shown in the picture. Try
walking on them. Was it easy?
Make a small bridge by tying
4 or 5 bamboo poles together.
Ask your teacher to help you.
Now walk on your bridge.
How did you feel? Did you fall
down? If you walk like this a
few times, you will start
finding it easy.
Do you think it would be
easier to walk on this
bridge barefoot or with
shoes or slippers? Why?

by a forest of big grey tree trunks. He blinked his eyes and looked
around. Oh! There was Amma.

the legs and trunks of his family members.
The sun was overhead and it

Do you know that an adult elephant can eat more than 100
kilograms of leaves and twigs in one day? Elephants do not
rest very much. They sleep for only two to four hours in a
day. Elephants love to play with mud and water. The mud

The Story of Amrita

This is a true story from long long ago. Almost three hundred
years ago, in a village called Khejadli, lived Amrita. Khejadli village
is near Jodhpur in Rajasthan. The village got its name because of
the many Khejadi trees that grew there.
The people of this village took great care of the plants, trees
and animals. Goats, deer, hares and peacocks roamed fearlessly
there. The people of the village remembered what their elders
used to tell them. They used to say. "Agar perh hain to hum hain.
Plants and animals can survive without us, but we can not survive

children. They did not like it when I
started teaching. They started to
scold and scare the children, so that
they would not come to me. For some

all came back because I used to teach
them with love and care.

A Secret
I learnt how to ride a motor-

fell down and got hurt many

There are many litchi trees in our area. Honeybees are attracted
to the litchi flowers. Many people do bee-keeping and collect
honey. I thought that I could also do this. I joined a course run
by the government to learn about this. I was the only girl in this
course. During my training I found that honeybees lay their
eggs from October to December. This was the best time to start
bee-keeping.

Becoming a Bee-keeper
I completed my bee-keeping course. But I did not have money to
keep my own bees and start work. I continued to teach and with
time could collect 5000. With this money, I bought two boxes
for keeping bees. Each box costs 2000. With the remaining
money, I bought sugar to make the syrup for honeybees, and
medicines to clean the beehives.

But Shyamala was not the one to give up. She dragged herself
and managed to touch the line in the centre.
When Shyamala touched the line, all the girls of the opposite
team were holding her. So all of them got 'out'. But Rosy argued
that Shyamala had taken a breath in between, so the team was
not 'out'. Shyamala insisted that this was not true. She said
that if she had taken a breath, why did the girls keep holding
her? There was a big argument. Finally Shyamala won.

The Game of Kabaddi
So, this is what a game of Kabaddi is like. Pushing and pulling.
screaming and shouting, dragging and falling on the ground. It
is a rough game, yet it has many rules.
It is lots of fun, and lots of exercise. Holding your breath
while running and continuously saying Kabaddi-Kabaddi and
also trying to touch the players of the opposite team. So many
things to do in Kabaddi. You can do this as long as you can
hold your breath.
You need to use both your body and mind in this game. You
have to use your strength to pull or stop the players. At the
same time, you have to think about how to enter the other side.
You have to decide whom to touch quickly and come back. If
you get caught, then how do you reach the line in the centre.

playing.
The sisters were young when their father died. Their mother
and mamas (maternal uncles) brought them up. Both uncles
used to play Kabaddi and Kho-Kho. They encouraged the three
girls to play Kabaddi.
Jwala and Leela talk about their experiences. "Almost fifty
years ago when we started to play Kabaddi, girls never got a
chance to play this game. Parents did not let them play the game.
But we always felt that we should play and my uncles and mother
supported us. We three learnt the game and some other girls
also joined us. We formed a Kabaddi Club, which is active even
today."
Remembering Those Days!
Leela and Heera still get very excited when they talk about their
matches. They tell how they won some matches which they were
about to lose. This was possible because of their strong will.
During those matches, some very interesting things happened.
Once they had to go to a different town for a big match. Leela
tells, "The match had to start at 6.30 in the evening. We went to
see a movie from 3 to 6 o'clock. We thought we would be back in
time for the match. As soon as the movie started, we noticed
some noise and disturbance. It was created by our mama, who
was looking for us in the hall with a torch. When he found us, he
gave a big scolding right there in the cinema hall."

Children show the Way
Too little water, or no water... this was nothing new for the people in
the Holgundi area of Karnataka. The wells would have some water only
in rainy days. In the past three years, there was not even enough rain.
Everything had dried up there. There was no water for drinking, for
growing crops, or for animals. People had to leave their village and go
to nearby towns for some work. Children had to leave school to go with
the elders.
The village panchayat was worried. All the members discussed what
could be done. This panchayat had some special members - children.
The children's panchayat was called Bhima Sangh.
"Has our village always had water shortage?" the children asked the
elders. "No, it was not so before." replied village people. Some of the
elders recalled that up on the hill, there used to be a water tank. The
tank would fill with water when it rained. There used to be fish in the
tank, and greenery around it. Those days, even the village wells and
the pond used to have enough water. On hearing this, the Bhima Sangh
decided that they would first look for that tank.
The tank was on the hill. They found that the tank was full of mud
and stones now. How could water fill? The tank had many cracks. How
could the water remain in the tank? There were no trees and grass-
how could there be greenery?
The children said, "We must clean the tank and make the area green
again." For this, it was important to first understand how things had
been before and why they had changed now. This would help them to
plan for solving the water problem. And, that too, not only for one year.
but for the years ahead.

Rationalised 2023-24
Too Much Water, Too Little Water
The panchayat took help from some experts. Together, they made a
plan and together they worked for it.
The tank was first properly cleaned. The cracks were repaired. Grass
and trees were planted all around the tank. As the tank was on a hill, a
lot of rain water used to flow down the slopes. With this water, soil also
would flow away. So the children made a small dam on the slope, to
stop the water and soil.
Then everybody waited for the rains to come. When it rained, the
tank filled up with the water. The children put some fish in the tank.
They kept guard to make sure that nobody stole the fish or harmed the
plants. One monsoon went by, then another. Things got better every
year. The tank filled a little more, the plants grew, the fish multiplied.
After two or three years, the tank remained full of water even after the
rains had stopped. The wells and ponds in the village had water again.
There was greenery once again. The people did not have to leave their
village for work.
The hard work of Bhima Sangh had shown results. The children
had shown the way! Those children are now grown up. But the Bhima
Sangh continues, and every year more children are proud to become its
members and work together; to always lead the way.

were pulled when there was suddenly a strong wind and rain.
Both of them picked up the radish and ran. They had just
reached home when a branch of the neem tree in the courtyard
broke and fell. In fact, Abbu was lucky to have missed by only
a few inches. Despite the strong wind the tree remained firm
on the ground. They both sat down to have tea with Ammi.

Now Vani and Prasad also help their parents after coming back

From thread to Cloth
Father brings bundles of thread from Pochampalli town. Mother
then puts these threads in boiling water to wash away the dirt
and stains. Then everybody works to dye the thread with bright
colours. These threads are then dried and rolled into bundles.
These bundles are put onto looms and the cloth is woven. Silk
cloth and silk sarees are woven from the silk thread. Cotton
thread is used to weave cotton sarees, cloth, sheets, etc.
The loom has many needles. The size and number of the
needles changes according to the design. The weavers weave
the beautiful Pochampalli sarees in bright colours. Through
their traditional craft they have made their region world famous.
A Craft in Danger
Great skill is needed to weave such special sarees. It also takes
many days of hard labour. After all this, it is difficult to get a
good price for these sarees. Silk is becoming expensive
day by day. Big shopkeepers give very little money for the sarees,
though they themselves sell them at very high price. That is
why many weavers are giving up their family craft. Many are
leaving their villages to work as labourers in big cities. We need
to solve this problem by helping them get a better price.
Otherwise, this precious craft will be lost forever.

Lieutenant Commander Wahida Prism, doctor in the Indian
Navy. She is one of the few women who has worked on a
naval ship. She is the first woman to lead a parade. This is
considered to be a very big honour in the armed forces.
We specially spoke to Wahida for this book. Let us
read what we spoke.
-
Question Wahida, tell us something about your
childhood and school.
-
Wahida I come from a very small village called.
Thannamandi. This is in Rajouri district of Jammu and
Kashmir. I did my schooling from a government school.
Most of the girls from the village studied in my school.
However, few of them ever thought of what they would do

special and move forward in life. I was very interested in higher
studies and wanted to complete the tenth class. In my area, it
was a new thing at that time. My mother and father had to face
many problems because of this. We even had to move out of our
village. We then went to live with my grandmother in Rajouri. I
did my twelfth class from there.
Question - So you always thought differently right from the
beginning?
Wahida - Even when I was very young I wanted to do something
different. I was very fond of riding a motor-cycle. We are three
sisters. My father wanted one of us to become a doctor and one
a teacher. He wanted the third daughter to become a lawyer or
join the police force. I have become a doctor in the Indian Navy
and my sister is in the Jammu Police Force.
Question - How did you become a doctor?
-
Wahida I worked very hard. My friends and family members.
helped me a lot. I got admission in Jammu Medical College. I
studied for five years and did my M.B.B.S.
Question - How did you get into the Defence Forces? Didn't
your family stop you?
-
Wahida Oh, no! They felt that a job in the Forces would be the
best thing for me. When I was very small, I would see army
officers in our village. I wanted to be like them. This was really
a very big dream for me! While in school, I attended camps..

climbed mountains and was a
"Girl Guide". After I became a
doctor, I appeared for an interview
to join the Armed Forces. I got
selected there and received a
training for six months.
Question - Why did you join the
Indian Navy? Do you not have to
live on the naval ship?
Wahida - Well, I am very fond of travelling. I like to see different
places. I wanted to go to far-off places. I was born in the hills
and now I am working in sea. I really enjoy it.
Very few lady-officers have worked on a ship. I am one of
them. Earlier, women were not allowed to go on Naval ships.
When an opportunity was given, I myself went forward and
gave my name. I even want to go o in a submarine. I want to do
everything which people think women cannot do. At present
women are not allowed to go in submarines, but whenever it
is allowed, I will certainly go.
-
Question So what happened to your degree of M.B.B.S?
Wahida - I am a doctor, but in Indian Navy a naval doctor does
not just give medicine to patients. She is in fact, a medical
officer. The ship goes to sea for three-four months at a time.
There, it is my responsibility to make sure that everybody on
the ship stays fit and healthy. I carry out medical check-ups of
all the officers and sailors. I also have to make sure that no

Wahida - First aid' is given on every naval ship. Each ship has
one doctor and two or three assistants. Necessary medicines

Question - You are the first woman to lead a passing out parade.
You must have worked very hard for this.
Wahida - My seniors gave this opportunity to me after seeing my
performance for three years. I felt happy that they had chosen
me and showed faith in me. So I practiced very sincerely.
Question - Tell us something about that parade.
Wahida - In a parade, four platoons march behind the leader.
Thirty-six commands have to be given during the entire parade.
These must be given in a very loud voice so that it is heard till
the rear. The voice should also reach the spectators sitting on
the other side of the ground.

one, the entire parade can get
spoiled. I practised every
morning and evening for a
month. But, I have been
participating in parades since school.
Question - What is the meaning of the word 'Prism' in your
name?

glass which reflects seven colours. My father wanted me to be

Today is a special day for Chuskit. It is so special that last
night Chuskit could not even sleep. Do you know why? Chuskit
is ten years old, but today she is going to school for the first
time. She has been waiting for this day since long.
Chuskit's school is not very far from her house. You have to
take the big road and then walk along the lake. Cross the river
near the poplar trees, and then after a small climb, you reach

At first Chuskit did not know that she was different from
other children. But slowly she found that she could not do the
things that other children could. It was because of her legs.
Since birth, Chuskit could not use her legs.
Chuskit's Chair
All day, Chuskit used to sit near the window and draw pictures.
Her mother (Aama-le) said that Chuskit made the best drawings.
This made Chuskit happy. But Chuskit was happier when one
day her father (Aaba-le) got a chair which had wheels. She
quickly learnt how to sit in the chair and how to move it - back
and forth. Chuskit was so
happy because now she
did not need her father to
carry her everywhere.
When she wanted to go out
she would tell her mother
to put her in the wheel
chair. Now, she could
come outside on her own.

One day Abdul came to her house with a letter. When he saw
Chuskit, he asked her why she did not go to school. Chuskit told
him sadly, "I can not walk. Aaba-le cannot carry me all the way to
school everyday. I cannot even wheel my chair as the road to
school is not level. Also, how can I cross the river?"
Abdul asked, "But would you want to go to school if you
could? Chuskit was excited. She said. "Of course I want to go
to school just like all of you. I want to study and play...."
Her Meme-le (grandfather) stopped her and said, "Chuskit do
not dream. You know that this is not possible."
What are the things that you enjoy doing in school?
Do you like going to school?
Would you like it if you never could go to school?

Abdul went back from Chuskit's house.
but he had started thinking of how to
get Chuskit to school. He explained.

For this, the uneven road had to be made level. One group of
children started to level the road. Another group worked to
level the area near the river. But there was still a problem. How
would Chuskit cross the river? The older children took help
from the teacher to make a small bridge with wood across the
river. Everyone happily worked hard. They wanted Chuskit to
come to school.
Chuskit's Aama-le and Aaba-le gave hot tea and biscuits to
everyone. Chuskit's Meme-le had tears in his eyes - not because
he was sad, but because he was very happy!
By the evening, the work was done. All the children were
happy. But the happiest of all was Chuskit. Her dream was about

And today, it was that special day. Chuskit was all ready.
