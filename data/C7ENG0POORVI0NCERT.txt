A big bright tear splashed down her nose. And another.
A kingfisher swept down, its wings an arrow of blue in the
sunlight. And a green lizard slithered down to the river’s edge
to bask in the sun.
“Dear, dear!” said a sleepy, murmuring voice, “What’s the
matter?”
Jahnavi was startled, because she was sure she had been quite
alone. It couldn’t have been the lizard. And the kingfisher was
up in the thicket of bamboo eating the fish it had caught. It
couldn’t be the parrots, because parrots shrieked and this was
such a sleepy voice. She looked around her. There wasn’t a
soul in sight. She was rather scared and wanted to run away.
“You shouldn’t cry, you know,” the voice went on. “And you
really shouldn’t be scared, when you have been coming here
to see me every day, well, almost every day.”

She was puzzled. It was such a voice, like
the river. It couldn’t be the river!
“Well, tell me all about it,” said the River,
for it was the River. “I’ve got to hurry to reach
the sea, you know.”
“They won’t let me go to school,” said Jahnavi.
“I asked my mother, ‘Why can’t I go to school
like Ettan and Meena?’ And Mother had
replied, ‘You are too small, baby. Maybe
later.’ ” But when she was five, little
Ramu was born and Mother still said,
“Maybe next year. Jahnavi, mind your
little brother while I go to the fields.”
Now, she was nearly ten and minding
Little Appu, who was the smallest. “They
don’t want me. They only...”—she stopped with a sob...
“I am scared to go to school. And I’m so old now, they’ll never
let me go. But I want to go. I want to learn to read like Ettan
and Meena.” Jahnavi called her brother ‘Ettan’. Ettan means
‘Elder brother’, but his real name was Gopi. “I want to know
why spiders are yellow in yellow flowers, why bamboo
trees rustle, why the moon always comes from
behind the hills, never the other way, why
the baby fish in the field water become
frogs, why...”
“Stop!” said the River. “You make me
breathless. So many whys! I can tell
you where the moon goes,” the River
said conspiratorially. “It goes down
towards the sea. I’ve seen; it always
takes the same way—over the
mountains and down to the sea,
like me!”

“Even little Ramu goes to school,” said Jahnavi, “pity, the school
isn’t by the sea,” said the River. “Then I could take you along,
you know. But, I suppose I couldn’t really. You’d get your feet
wet. And that would never do! I’m afraid there’s only one thing
you can do.”
“Can I do something?” asked Jahnavi. “Well, it’s up to you,”
said the River. “Seems to me little girls can do as much as little
boys—they swim as fast as little boys. You just slip along one
morning and sit there in the school and listen to what’s going
on, and maybe the teacher will let you stay.”
“I couldn’t,” gasped Jahnavi. “I couldn’t! They’d scare me!
They’d chase me out.”
The River laughed. “You? Scared?” the River said, “when you’re
not afraid of the green lizard, or of the snake in the bamboo
clump, (Jahnavi startled) or the big trains rattling past that
bridge.” “Trains are noisy; I prefer ships,” said the River.
Jahnavi never knew the snake lived in the bamboo clump.
“What are ships?” she asked.
“Big boats,” said the River, “so big that they can take hundreds
of people, and they sail along the sea with lights that shine all
night.”
Jahnavi held her breath. “Will they come here?” she asked.
“I’m afraid not,” said the River. “Too large, you know. Chandu’s
catamaran is good enough for me. Chandu can take you to see
a ship, someday.”
“They’d never let me!” wailed Jahnavi.
“Try going to school first,” said the River. “Remember—it’s up
to you!”

Jahnavi gathered courage. The next day she reached the school,
panting and out of breath and stood by the door listening while
the teacher read out the lesson. It was a story about a prince
called Asˊ hoka, who became a great king. Little Appu had fallen
asleep on her shoulder. She crept nearer and nearer till she was
in the back row, squatting with the others on the earthen floor.
Little Appu made no noise and she listened.
“Where did you spring from, little girl?” asked the teacher. “And
what is your name? You’re new in my class.”
“She’s Gopi’s sister, Gopi is in the next class,” said one of the boys.
“It’s Jahnavi,” said another. “So, you’re Gopi’s little sister? Nice
lad, Gopi.”
“If you really, really want to come to my school, Jahnavi,” the
teacher had said, “we’ll talk to your father about it. Don’t you
worry. We’ll find a way.”

Jahnavi saw the teacher walking up the steps to their gate the
next evening when she was lighting the lamp. She could see her
father scratching his cheek the way he did when he was worried
and the teacher was nodding and saying something she couldn’t
make out. And Mother said, “Little Jahnavi, I shall miss you when
you go to school. Girls should learn as much as they want. When I
was your age, I wanted to go to school, but your grandmother said
‘No’, but now, I am glad the teacher came to talk to your father.”

And Jahnavi said, “Mother, when I grow up, I’ll be
a teacher and I’ll go from house to house in our
village and ask all the little girls to come to my
school. And I’ll teach them all that I’m going to
learn.”
And she went down the path between the fields
the next morning before school began, to meet
the River. “I did it!” she told the River. “I was
scared, but I did it! And they’re letting me go. I’m
going to learn to write my name and do sums and
find out why our little fishes in the rice fields turn
into frogs.” She heard the river’s sleepy chuckle,
“Come again, little girl, and I’ll tell you all about
the ships that sail the sea.”

the colours, shapes, patterns, and textures
found in nature. Look closely at the plants,
trees, flowers, birds, and even the sky. Make
detailed notes of what you observe, focusing on
textures, movements, and how light plays with
these elements. Record your observations in

Let us read
King Bruce of Scotland flung himself down
In a lonely mood to think;
‘Tis true he was monarch, and wore a crown,
But his heart was beginning to sink.
For he had been trying to do a great deed,
To make his people glad;
He had tried and tried, but couldn’t succeed
And so he became quite sad.
He flung himself down in low despair,
As grieved as man could be;
And after a while he pondered there,
“I’ll give it all up,” said he.
Now just at that moment a spider dropped,
With its silken, filmy clue;
And the King, in the midst of his thinking, stopped
To see what the spider would do.
‘Twas a long way up to the ceiling dome,
And it hung by a rope so fine;
That how it would get to its cobweb home,
King Bruce could not divine.

It soon began to cling and crawl
Straight up with strong endeavour;
But down it came with a slippery sprawl,
As near to the ground as ever.
Up, up it ran, not a second to stay,
To utter the least complaint;
Till it fell still lower, and there it lay,
A little dizzy and faint.
Its head grew steady — again it went,
And travelled a half-yard higher;
‘Twas a delicate thread it had to tread,
And a road where its feet would tire.
Again it fell and swung below,
But again it quickly mounted;
Till up and down, now fast, now slow,
Nine brave attempts were counted.
“Sure,” cried the King, “that foolish thing
Will strive no more to climb;
When it toils so hard to reach and cling,
And tumbles every time.”
But up the insect went once more,
Ah me! ‘tis an anxious minute;
He’s only a foot from his cobweb door,
Oh say, will he lose or win it?
Steadily, steadily, inch by inch,
Higher and higher he got;
And a bold little run at the very last pinch
Put him into his native cot.
“Bravo, bravo!” the King cried out,
“All honour to those who try;
The spider up there, defied despair;
He conquered, and why shouldn’t I?”
And Bruce of Scotland braced his mind,
And gossips tell the tale,
That he tried once more as he tried before,
And that time did not fail.

VI The spider’s climbing is compared to King Bruce’s own
struggles. Just as the spider repeatedly attempts to reach its
web, Bruce is trying to achieve a great deed for his people.
This poetic device is called metaphor. It strengthens the poem’s message
about perseverance—keep trying till we succeed.
A metaphor is a figure of speech that involves an implied comparison
between two unlike things without using ‘like’, ‘as’, or ‘as...as’. It
suggests that one thing is another, highlighting similarities between
them to add deeper meaning or understanding.
1. Read the following sentences and identify metaphors and similes.
Write M for metaphor and S for simile.
(i)

He ran as fast as a cheetah.

(ii)

The world is a stage.

(iii)

The night was as dark as coal.

(iv)

He sang like an angel.

(v)

Her voice was music to his ears.

(vi)

The classroom was a zoo.

(vii) The baby slept like a log.
(viii) Her smile was as bright as the sun.
(ix)

The lake was a mirror, reflecting the sky.

I, who cannot see, find hundreds of things to interest me
through mere touch. I feel the delicate symmetry of a
leaf. I pass my hands lovingly about
the smooth skin of a silver birch, or
the rough, shaggy bark of a pine. In
spring, I touch the branches of trees
hopefully in search of a bud, the first
sign of awakening Nature after her
winter’s sleep. Occasionally, I am very
fortunate; I place my hand gently on a
small tree and feel the happy quiver of
a bird in full song.

evenness
birch: a slender
tree with thin
peeling bark

quiver: shiver

At times, my heart cries out with
longing to see all these things. If I can
get so much pleasure from mere touch,
how much more beauty must be revealed by sight. And
I have imagined what I should most like to see if I were
given the use of my eyes, say, for just three days.
I should divide the period into three parts. On the first
day, I should want to see the people whose kindness and
companionship have made my life worth living. I do not
know what it is to see into the heart of a friend through
that ‘window of the soul’, the eye.
I can only ‘see’ through my fingertips the outline of a face.
I can detect laughter, sorrow and other obvious emotions.
I know my friends from the feel of their faces.

the earth before man appeared, with his

conquer the animal kingdom.

the same method can be applied to your other senses. Hear

each object as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail. Smell
the perfume of flowers, taste with relish each morsel, as if
tomorrow you could never smell and taste again. Make the
most of every sense; glory in all the facets of pleasure and
beauty, which the world reveals to you through the several
means of contact, which Nature provides. But of all the senses,
I am sure that sight must be the most delightful.

Let us listen (refer to page 12)
I Read the words given in the box below. You will listen to five people
speak about school life. As you listen, circle the words that are used by
the speakers. There are two words you do not need.

Speaker (i):		(Father) Should girls attend school? Yes, they
should. I do my best to ensure that both my son and
daughter get equal opportunities. I look forward
to their successful careers and rewarding lives. I
feel education gives freedom to make choices in
life. Whether my daughter wants to work in an
organisation or be a homemaker, it should be her
choice and the same applies to my son.
Speaker (ii): (Grandmother) I went to school but many girls at
that time could not attend school because some
elders in the village felt that girls should help in
the house and take care of their little brothers and
sisters. I am happy that the situation has changed
today.
Speaker (iii): (Teacher) The school prepares students for
meaningful and useful participation in the world
of work by learning hands-on abilities and skills,
developing equal respect for head-hands-heart,
valuing the dignity of labour, and understanding
vocational choices for the future.
Speaker (iv): (Student) I like to go to school. I feel that by coming
to school and reading the books, I learn about things
from all over the world. I also have friends with
whom I can share my feelings.

However, as the Head of an institution, I know that
all students can work hard. My message to students
is that they should attend school regularly and take
part in every school activity without bothering
whether it is for girls or boys. The idea is to focus on
learning.

Try Again
Let us listen (refer to page 24)
1. You will listen to a story about an ant. Read the questions given below
and before you listen, guess the answers to these questions.
		 Hello everyone,
		 I’m sure you have enjoyed learning about King Bruce and the spider. Let
me share another story with you.

In a thick green forest, there lived a little ant. She was known for
her determination and never-give-up attitude. One sunny day,
the ant found a delicious piece of roti that was too big for her to
carry alone.
“This crumb is huge, but I must get it back to the anthill. My
family will be so happy!” she thought to herself.
She tried to lift the crumb with all her might, but it was too heavy.
She tried pushing it, pulling it and even rolling it, but nothing
seemed to work. Exhausted and saddened, she sat down and
began to cry.

40

Unit 1.indd 40

As the ant sat there, feeling beaten, she noticed a small bird
nearby. The bird was trying to build a nest. It picked up twigs
and leaves, but every time it tried to place them, the wind would
blow them away. However, the bird did not give up. It kept trying,
over and over again, until finally, it managed to build a strong
nest.

06-Mar-25 2:47:33 PM

Learning Together

“If that bird can keep trying and succeed, then I shouldn’t give
up either,” she thought, feeling inspired.
Determined once more, the ant gathered all her strength and
decided to try again. She called her fellow ants for help. Together,
they formed a chain and lifted the crumb with their combined
strength. Slowly but surely, they carried the crumb back to the
anthill.
“We did it! Thank you, everyone! We showed that with teamwork
and never giving up, we can achieve anything!” the ant shouted,
excited and grateful.
She and her friends celebrated their success.
We too should learn this lesson from the ant’s experience—never
give up, no matter how difficult the situation may seem.
Hope you all liked the story.
Thank you!

answers are correct. Rectify wherever needed.

Mother : Well, Digital India is about more than just internet
access. It aims to include everyone, including people
with disabilities, by providing digital infrastructure
and services. For the visually impaired, it means access
to assistive technologies like screen readers, voice-overenabled smartphones and apps that can make daily
activities easier.
Anuj

: Ohh... interesting. What is a screen reader, Ma?

Mother : I knew you’d ask about it! Well, a screen reader is a
software application that helps people who are visually
impaired use computers and smartphones. It reads out
the text displayed on the screen and provides audio
feedback.
Anuj

: That’s amazing! So, Tara can use a computer just like
we do?

Mother : Yes, she can.
Anuj

: So, it makes a big difference in their daily lives.

Mother : It certainly does. It ensures that people who are visually
impaired can use digital services independently, without
help from others. This can improve their quality of life.
It also opens up more job opportunities in fields like IT,
banking, and more, where they can work just efficiently
like anybody else.
Anuj

: Wow! So that means people who are visually impaired
can work and do things on their own? I’m so proud of
my school.

Mother : Yes, and this way, we can ensure that the benefits of
Digital India reach everyone, helping them to participate
fully in all areas of life.
		 Remember, inclusion is not just about having the right tools, but also
about having the right mindset.

Let us read

I
Doctor Dolittle was sitting in his kitchen talking with the Cat’sfood-Man who had come to see him with a stomach-ache.
“Why don’t you give up being a people’s doctor, and be an
animal doctor?” asked the Cat’s-food-Man.
The parrot, Polynesia, was sitting in the window looking out
at the rain and singing a sailor song to herself. She stopped
singing and started to listen.

scholar: a
learned person

“You see, Doctor,” the Cat’s-food-Man went on, “you know all
about animals—much more than what these vets here do.
That book you wrote—about cats, why, it’s wonderful! I can’t
read or write myself—my wife, Theodosia, is a scholar, and
she read your book to me. You might have been a cat yourself.
You know the way they think.”
When the Cat’s-food-Man had gone the parrot flew off the
window on to the Doctor’s table and said, “That man’s got
sense. That’s what you ought to do. Be an animal doctor. Give
the silly people up—if they haven’t brains enough to see you’re
the best doctor in the world. Take care of animals instead—
they’ll soon find it out. Be an animal doctor.”
“Oh, there are plenty of animal doctors,” said John Dolittle,
putting the flowerpots outside on the windowsill to get the
rain.
“Yes, there are plenty,” said Polynesia. “But none of them are

any good at all. Now listen, Doctor, and I’ll tell you something.
Did you know that animals can talk?”
“I knew that parrots can talk,” said the Doctor.
“Oh, we parrots can talk in two languages—people’s language
and bird language,” said Polynesia proudly. “If I say, ‘Polly
wants a cracker’, you understand me. But hear this: Ka-ka oiee, fee-fee?”

cracker: a thin,
dry biscuit
usually eaten
with cheese

“Good Gracious!” cried the Doctor. “What does that mean?”
“That means, ‘Is the porridge hot yet?’—in bird language.”
“My! You don’t say so!” said the Doctor. “You never talked that
way to me before.”
“What would have been the good?” said Polynesia, dusting
some cracker crumbs off her left wing. “You wouldn’t have
understood me if I had.”
“Tell me some more,” said the Doctor, all excited; and he
rushed over to the drawer and came back with a book and
a pencil. “Now don’t go too fast—and I’ll write it down.
This is interesting—very interesting—something quite new.
Give me the Birds’ A.B.C. first—slowly now.”

Birds’ A.B.C.:
(here) the
language that
birds speak

So that was the way the Doctor came to know that animals
had a language of their own and could talk to one
another. And all that afternoon, while it was
raining, Polynesia sat on the kitchen table
giving him bird words to put down in the
book.
At teatime, when the dog, Jip, came in,
the parrot said to the Doctor, “See, he’s
talking to you.”
“Looks to me as though he were
scratching his ear,” said the Doctor.
“But animals don’t always speak
with their mouths,” said the parrot
in a high voice, raising her eyebrows.
“They talk with their ears, with their
feet, with their tails—with everything.
Sometimes they don’t want to make a

noise. Do you see now the way he’s twitching up one side of his
nose?”
“What’s that mean?” asked the Doctor.
“That means, ‘Can’t you see that it has stopped raining?’”
Polynesia answered. “He is asking you a question. Dogs nearly
always use their noses for asking questions.”
After a while, with the parrot’s help, the Doctor got to learn the
language of the animals so well that he could talk to them himself
and understand everything they said. Then he gave up being a
people’s doctor altogether.
Let us discuss
I Complete the following sentence by selecting a suitable reason.
		The Cat’s-food-Man suggests to Doctor Dolittle that he should
become an animal doctor because he believes that Dolittle
______________________________________________________.
1. earns less fee by treating human patients
2. enjoys the company of animals as they speak less
3. dislikes spending time with human patients
4. knows more about animals than the local veterinarians
II Fill in the blanks by choosing the suitable option given in the brackets.
		 Doctor Dolittle reacts to Polynesia’s information about animal languages
with both excitement and ____________ (certainty/curiosity). He rushes
to ____________ (write/memorise) the bird words she provides and is
interested in learning more.
III Do you think Doctor Dolittle would be famous as an animal doctor?
If yes, why? If not, why not?

II
As soon as the Cat’s-food-Man had told everyone that John Dolittle
was going to become an animal doctor, old ladies began to bring
him their pet pugs and poodles who had eaten too much cake;
and farmers came many miles to show him sick cows and sheep.

One day a plough horse was brought to him; and the poor thing
was terribly glad to find a man who could talk in horse language.
“You know, Doctor,” said the horse, “that vet over the hill knows
nothing at all. He has been treating me six weeks now—for
something or the other. What I need is spectacles. I am going
blind in one eye. There’s no reason why horses shouldn’t wear
glasses, the same as people. But that stupid man over the hill
never even looked at my eyes. He kept on giving me big pills.
I tried to tell him, but he couldn’t understand a word of horse
language. What I need is spectacles.”
“Of course—of course,” said the Doctor. “I’ll get you some at once.”
“I would like a pair like yours,” said the horse—“only green.
They’ll keep the Sun out of my eyes while I’m ploughing the field.”
“Certainly,” said the Doctor. “Green ones you shall have.”
“You know, the trouble is, Sir,” said the plough horse as the
Doctor opened the front door to let him out—“the trouble is that
anybody thinks he can doctor animals—just because the animals
don’t complain. As a matter of fact, it takes a much cleverer man
to be a really good animal doctor than it does to be a good people’s
doctor.”
“Well, well!” said the Doctor.
“When will my glasses be ready?”

“I’ll have them for you next week,” said the Doctor.
“Come in again Tuesday—Good morning!”

Then John Dolittle got a fine, big pair of green spectacles; and
the plough horse stopped going blind in one eye and could see
as well as ever.
countryside:
rural area

And soon it became a common sight to see farm animals
wearing glasses in the countryside, round Puddleby; and a
blind horse was a thing unknown.
And so it was with all the other animals that were brought to
him. As soon as they found that he could talk their language,
they told him where the pain was and how they felt, and of
course it was easy for him to cure them.
Now all these animals went back and told their brothers and
friends that there was a doctor in the little house with the big
garden who really was a doctor. And whenever any creatures
got sick—not only horses and cows and dogs—but all the little
things of the fields, like harvest mice, badgers, and bats, all
came at once to his house on the edge of the town, so that his
big garden was nearly always crowded with animals trying to
get in to see him.
There were so many that came that he had to have special
doors made for the different kinds. He wrote ‘HORSES’ over

the front door, ‘COWS’ over the side door, and ‘SHEEP’ on the
kitchen door. Each kind of animal had a separate door—even
the mice had a tiny tunnel made for them into the cellar, where
they waited patiently in rows for the Doctor to come round
to them.
And so, in a few years’ time, every living thing for miles and
miles got to know about John Dolittle, M.D. And the birds who
flew to other countries in the winter told the animals in foreign
lands about Dolittle who could understand their talk and help
them in their troubles. In this way he became famous among
the animals—all over the world. He was happy and liked his
life very much.

Came walking down this street
He wore a shoe upon his head
And hats upon his feet.

His manners were polite;
But never had I seen before
Such a funny sounding sight.
He said, “Allow me to present
Your Highness with a rose.”
And taking out a currant bun
He held it to my nose.
I staggered back against the wall
And then I answered, “Well!
I never saw a rose with such
A funny looking smell.”
He then began to sing a song,
And sat down on the ground;
You never heard in all your life
Such a funny feeling sound.
“My friend, why do you wear two hats
Upon your feet?” I said.
He turned the other way about,
And hopped home on his head.

Let us learn
Read the following phrases from the poem.
• walking down

• taking out

• sat down

These are phrasal verbs.
Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb with a preposition or
adverb that together function as a single unit. They often have
meanings that are different from the individual words used alone.
The same verb followed by different prepositions or adverbs conveys
different meanings.

		 God smiles and replies, “It’s less than a rupee for me.”
		 The man quickly requests, “God, may I have a rupee?”
		 God promptly says, “Wait a minute.”

Let us explore
I In ancient Indian literature and mythology, there are several humorous
or funny characters who play important roles in the stories. These
characters often represent wit, humour and mischief while conveying
deeper moral lessons. Here are a few well-known funny characters:
			 Tenali Rama

Birbal

Mullah Nasruddin

			 King Vikramaditya and Betal
		 Take any story to read and share it with your classmates and the teacher.
II We can identify the acts of the funny man with certain modernday activities that have playfulness, or unconventional behaviour.
For example:
Street Performers or Clowns: Like the funny man in the poem, modernday street performers or clowns often dress in unusual ways and do
unexpected acts to entertain people.

67

Unit 2.indd 67

06-Mar-25 2:51:09 PM

Poorvi

Performance Art or Abstract Theatre: The funny man’s actions, such
as singing a song and hopping on his head, resemble performance art
or abstract theatre, where artists break conventional rules to create
thought-provoking, often humorous experiences.
		
Children’s Entertainment and Comedy Shows: The funny man’s behaviour
is reflected in children’s shows to evoke laughter.
		In these examples, the common theme is humour, imagination, and
defying logic or expectation, which is exactly what the funny man in the
poem represents.
III Sukumar Ray, an Indian poet and illustrator, wrote poems in a similar
style in his book Abol Tabol.
		 You may also share a similar poem from your native language with your
classmates and the teacher.

My Lost Pencil
Oh pencil, dear pencil, where have you gone?
I just had you here a minute at dawn!
You were sharp and perfect, ready to write,
Now you’re missing—gone from sight!
Did you roll off my desk? Did you fall to the floor?
Did someone swipe you for sure?
It’s always the same, I’ve lost fifty this year,
By the end of the month, they just disappear!
Next time, I’ll tie you with tape or a string,
Because losing my pencils is a real thing.

Mrs. Harding and Mrs. Lee will soon be here, and

Mrs. Shaw : Yes, I am. You leave your clothes all over the house.
Mary

: I’m not a child!

Mrs. Shaw : No, you’re not. So please keep your clothes in your
own room.
Mary

: Why are those two women coming here? Who’s Mrs.
Harding?

Mrs. Shaw : She’s the wife of a wealthy man, Mr. Harding. He
has just bought a big house in Lanfield. They lived in
London before. She’s coming to have a talk. I met her
in a shop and asked her to come.
Mary

: Oh, I’ve seen her children. They often come along the
road. Who’s Mrs. Lee?

Mrs. Shaw : She’s Mr. Harding’s sister. She has been staying with
them for a while.
Mary

: What are you going to talk about?

Mrs. Shaw : I don’t know. All kinds of things. One day you’ll have
to go to some of these houses yourself and talk to the
people there.
Mary

: I can talk now. I’ve been able to talk for a long time.

Mrs. Shaw : Yes, that’s true. You always talk too much. But does
anyone want to hear the things that you say?
Mary

: I can talk very well when I like. I’ll stay with you
today and talk to them when they come.

Mrs. Shaw : Oh, I don’t think so. You can go out for a walk. It will
be better if you do that.
Mary

: Why?

Mrs. Shaw : If you stay with me, you may not say the right thing.
Mary

: I know the right things to say: “Good afternoon”,
“How are you?” and things like that. Let me stay
today. I can do it very well. I’ll show you. Anyone
can talk.

do here in Lanfield, and I want to
know some more people. I want
some more friends here. So take
care when you say anything.
Mary

: Tell me what to say.

Mrs. Shaw : I can’t tell you everything, but
you’ll always be right if you’re
kind to people. Say things that
will please them. Then they’ll like
you. Laugh a lot, and try to make
them laugh too. And if everyone stops talking, say
something to make them talk again. They don’t want
to sit here and look at the floor without speaking.
Think of something to say.
Mary

: I can do that. There’s always something to say. Must I
do anything else?

Mrs. Shaw : When they are ready to leave, don’t jump out of your
chair and look gladly at the door. You must look sorry
when they want to leave.
Mary

: What shall I do when they want to go?

Mrs. Shaw : Ask them to stay a little while longer. Just say, “Must
you go? Can’t you stay?” or something like that. You
like them and you want them to stay, and you must
let them understand that.
Mary

: That’s not very hard, is it? I’ll remember that. “Must
you go? Can’t you stay? Must you go? Can’t you stay?”

Mrs. Shaw : That’s right. Now take your coat to your room
and change into a clean dress. You must look nice
when they come. And if everyone stops talking, say
something kind to make them talk again. And don’t
say anything that will make them angry.
Mary

Have you met Mr. Best? He’s a nice man. He lives

back by train every night. He lives in trains! (she

1. How did the son behave in the grocery queue?
(i)

strangely

(ii) impatiently

(iii) politely

2. The mother finally refers to her son as a __________________.
(i)

polite young man

(ii) responsible son

(iii) grateful person

II You will once again listen to the conversation. As you listen, select four
true statements from 1– 7 given below.
1. The mother uses the grocery store incident as an opportunity to teach
her son about patience and fairness.
2. The son recognises the value of apologising and understands that
it shows he notices others.
3. The son is gradually learning the importance of polite words and
actions from his mother’s guidance.
4. The mother discourages her son from speaking softly in public,
suggesting that people should adjust to his voice level.
5. The son feels that covering his mouth when coughing is only
important when he’s at home.
6. The son receives all advice readily while understanding its
importance.
7. The mother uses praise to support the polite behaviours she wants
her son to continue practising.

Let us speak
		 As you know
• Intonation is the rise and fall of the pitch of tone while speaking.
		 Let us learn about sentence stress.
• Sentence stress is laying emphasis on certain word(s) in a sentence.

→ The emphasis on particular words helps to convey the meaning
and importance of the sentence.

84

Unit 2.indd 84

06-Mar-25 2:51:35 PM

Wit and Humour

→ Content words like book, run, beautiful, quickly, etc., are mostly
stressed instead of function words like she, in, is, etc., in a sentence.
I Speak the given declarative sentence aloud.
I saw Mrs. Cotter this afternoon.
• Use falling intonation towards end of the sentence as declarative
sentences usually have falling intonation.
• Stress the words ‘Mrs. Cotter’.
		 Remember, stress does not mean to say the word louder than others. It
means to say a word with more emphasis than others.
II Speak the following declarative sentences with falling intonation and
stress the highlighted words.
1. The room looks cleaner now.

2. You always talk too much.

3. You leave your clothes all over the house.
III Work in pairs and speak the following sentences 1–5 aloud, as Mary.
Apply stress and falling intonation. Match each of the sentences to the
meaning they convey in (i)–(v).
		Sentences
1. I didn’t hurt anyone today.

2. I didn’t hurt anyone today.

3. I didn’t hurt anyone today.

4. I didn’t hurt anyone today.

5. I didn’t hurt anyone today.
		 Meaning conveyed
(i)

I might have done other things but did not hurt anyone.

(ii) I might cause hurt usually, but not anyone on this day.
(iii) The action of hurting anyone did not occur.
(iv) I, specifically, did not hurt anyone, possibly implying someone
else might have.
(v) I may have spoken a lot many things but not a single person
was hurt.

IV Now, speak the given declarative sentence with rising intonation towards
the end of sentence and stress the highlighted words.
		 I saw Mrs. Cotter this afternoon.
		 The rising intonation makes it sound like a question. It asks whether I
was the person who actually saw Mrs. Cotter: Did I see Mrs. Cotter this
afternoon?
Remember
The way we use stress and intonation in a sentence can change the
meaning of what we wish to say if we are not careful.

Let us write
Rewrite the play ‘Say the Right Thing’ as a short story, focusing on Mary’s
interactions with her mother and the guests.
• Ensure the story captures the main events, character emotions, and
humorous moments effectively.
• Use paragraphs to organise your story and include descriptive language
to bring the characters and events to life.
You may refer to the following hints:
• Begin with an introduction: describe Mary and Mrs. Shaw, their
relationship and the setting of the story.
• Explain Mrs. Shaw’s instructions to Mary before the guests arrive and
Mary’s confidence in handling the situation.
• Narrate the events when Mrs. Harding and Mrs. Lee visit, highlighting
Mary’s remarks and the guests’ reactions.
• Include key moments of humour and awkwardness to maintain the tone
of the play.
• Conclude by commenting on how the visit ended and Mary’s impact on
the situation.

		 Let us explore
I Work in groups. Enact your favourite part of the play.
		 Points to remember:

III ‘Vasudhaiva Kuṭumbakaṁ’ (olq/So dq VqEcde) is a
Sanskrit phrase which means the world is one family. Vasudha (olq/k)
means Earth; eva (,o) translates to ‘is thus’ and Kuṭumbakaṁ (dq VqEcde)
means ‘family’. The phrase originates from ancient Indian texts like
the Maha Upanishad and the Hitopadesha.
		This saying highlights the interconnectedness of all people,
suggesting that humanity is part of a single global family. It
encourages unity, cooperation, and treating others with kindness
and empathy, regardless of differences in nationality, race, or
religion. The message is often used to promote global peace and
mutual understanding among diverse cultures and nations.
‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ was chosen as the theme for the G20
Summit which captured the essence of global unity, common bonds,
and shared aspirations for a better future.

all the topics I needed to cover.
Once I finished my lunch, I got up to put my shoes away in my
room and placed my plate in the kitchen. However, being so
preoccupied, I ended up doing the opposite! I walked to my room
with my plate in hand and left it on my desk. Then, I took my
shoes and placed them in the kitchen!
As I stood there, confused, I realised what I had done. I couldn’t
help but laugh at myself. I shook my head, recovered my shoes

always stand in queues and wait for our turn. It’s fair
for everyone, right?
Son

: Hmm, I guess. Even if it takes a lot of time?

Mother : Well, that’s when we practise patience. And when it’s
our turn, what do we say to the shopkeeper?
Son

: We say, ‘Thank you’. And ‘Please’ if we ask for something,
right?

Mother : Yes! Those are polite words. Why do you think they’re
important?

about yesterday when you bumped into that lady with
the blue sari?
Son

: Oh, I said sorry right away. You always tell me it’s
important to apologise.

Mother : That’s true. Why do you think it’s important to
apologise?
Son

: Um… so people know I didn’t mean to do it and that I
care?

Mother : Yes, it shows you’re responsible. And how about when
we’re in places like the library? What kind of voice
should we use?
Son

: Oh, I know this! We speak softly so we don’t bother
others.

Mother : Right again! It’s called using an ‘inside voice’.
Son

: I know. I also know that we should cover our mouth
when we yawn, sneeze or cough in a gathering or a
public place.

Mother : Absolutely! You’re getting really good at remembering
these things. And when we talk at home or school, what
should we do when someone else is speaking?
Son

: We wait for our turn. It’s not well-mannered to
interrupt.

Mother : You’ve got it, Rohan. You’re becoming a really polite
young man.
Son

: Thanks, Ma. So, do you think I’ll be ready to handle the
grocery queue next time?

“Who put that water bag here?” roared my father from the
front doorstep. “Your burglar alarm,” I hissed to my brother
Anand, who was getting ready to disappear from the house.
Ma rushed in to see what the racket was all about and found
Papa standing there, sopping wet and scowling.
“I want to know who is behind this nonsense,” Papa said
grimly.

“I don’t care what it’s supposed to be,” Papa said.
Anand had vanished by this time and reappeared only after
dinner when Papa had cooled down.
Before this story, let me put you in the picture. I am Anita,
fourteen years old. My brother Anand, one year younger
than me, caused all that hoo-ha with his burglar alarm.
And this is not the first time he’s got on Papa’s
nerves or frightened someone half to death in
the house. The trouble with him is that he
thinks he is a scientist. He loves tinkering with
all sorts of electrical gadgets, tools, dynamos,
planks of wood, and things like that. And he
keeps creating ‘inventions’ that never work
out as they are supposed to.
Recently there had been a rush of thefts in
the colony and Anand had got it into his
head that what was needed was a burglar
alarm. So, the minute Papa left for the
office and Ma for the market, he started
on his latest scheme. As usual I had to
be involved, though I’d have preferred
to finish my novel. “If you get a shelling,
don’t bring me in,” I warned Anand.
“Nothing will go wrong this time. I’ve
planned it out carefully. See the blueprint.”

Unit 3.indd 92

Dreams and Discoveries

Anand loves words like blueprint—it makes
him feel professional! Anyway, I looked at the
elaborate drawing of doors, wires, and bells
and asked, “How does this thing work?”
“It’s quite simple. The moment the door opens,
this alarm is tripped off and makes a clanging
sound. Then this water bag here is loosened
and falls on the thief’s head. By then we call
the police—simple!”
“But how does the alarm know that a burglar is
opening the door?”
“I’ve taken care of that,” Anand said loftily. I had
my own doubts about the alarm’s guessing powers, but kept
them to myself because when Anand is in one of his inventive
moods, nothing stops him.
“You see,” Anand explained smugly, “A thief tries to open the
door stealthily. I’ve rigged it up so that the alarm works only
when the door is opened gently.”
I was sceptical. “Remember, if Papa asks, I’m not involved,” I
warned. “Now clean up this mess before anyone gets home.”
As you already know, my doubts about the alarm were
quite justified. Papa, who always opens the door softly, was
thoroughly soaked and angry as angry could be. Anyway, for
a week after this, Anand did not dare try out anything new.
Then we saw this film ‘Back to the Future’. I don’t know if you
have seen it, but it’s all about a time machine. Well, that was
the end of peace and quiet in
the house.

My brother decided that he
had to make a time machine
too. Papa locked up his tool
box and hid the key while Ma
kept a wary eye on her oven
and mixer. Because, as I told
you, when Anand is on one
of his inventing binges, he
takes apart all the gadgets in
the house to collect parts. You
can’t imagine the noise that

was going on—hammering and sawing and clattering. Anand’s
room, next to our room, was transformed into a network of
wires, springs, levers, and bulbs. There was an enormous
panel which was to be control switchboard. As for Anand, he
went around looking like a savage. When Ma didn’t notice, the
fellow didn’t even comb his hair.

disorganised

Anand just wouldn’t let anyone into his room. Finally, after a
fortnight of frantic activity, the time machine was ready. “We
can try it out tonight,” Anand announced to everyone at home
at lunch time.
“I don’t know what you’ve been up to in that room, but you’re
not trying out anything new,” Papa said firmly.
“But it’s a time machine! I’ve invented it,” Anand protested.
“When I say NO, I mean NO,” Papa said, glaring.

“Poor boy,” Ma said noticing Anand’s crestfallen look.
“At least let’s take a look at it.”
Papa sighed. “All right, but if the house falls, it’s your fault.”
As it turned out, we could not try out the time machine that
day at all. The next day, Papa and Ma were going to Kharagpur,
a few hours away from Calcutta (now Kolkata), for a wedding.
Ma was worried about leaving us alone, but we reassured her.
“We’re old enough to look after ourselves, Ma,” I said. “And we
can go next door to Sharma Aunty if we need anything.”
“And it’s only one night,” Anand added.

upset or hurt

“All right. But promise me you won’t do anything with that
time machine till we come back,” Ma said sternly, looking at
Anand. He promised half-heartedly, offended at this lack of
respect for his creation. I breathed a sigh of relief.
Let us discuss

machine? If yes, why? If no, why not?

They left by the afternoon train and were coming back the
following evening. Anand fell asleep immediately, but I stayed
up to finish a novel. At about eleven thirty I thought I heard
a scratching at the front door. Telling myself it was only my
imagination, I went back to the book. A little later there was
a rattle and a click. I was really scared, I can tell you, what
with a murder story before me and then strange noises in the
middle of the night! I shook Anand and whispered, “Listen,
there’s someone at the door.”
“Go and open it then,” he muttered groggily.
“You silly! Someone’s trying to get in,” I said.

groggily:
sleepily

Anand sat up. “Who? What?”
“I don’t know,” I said. “What shall we do?”
“Let’s holler for help,” he said. Before we could do anything,
the door swung open and we found ourselves looking
at a ruffianly fellow with a green scarf around his neck.
Anand gasped.
“Hey, it’s Boppa!” I whispered. It was indeed the fellow who
had recently begun sweeping out the compounds in our row of
houses. So, he was the thief, and no wonder. He knew exactly
when the occupants were out, leaving the coast clear.
The fellow gave an evil grin. “One squeak out of you and see
what happens,” he said, brandishing his cudgel and backing
out of the room. We heard him slide the latch in.
“What do we do now?” I asked in a low voice.

“Let’s shout anyway,” Anand suggested.
The door opened suddenly again in the middle of our
discussion.
“No noise from you! Now, where is your father’s room?”
I was about to direct him upstairs when Anand said quickly,
“The one next to this one.”
“You silly goose!” I said angrily as soon as the man had gone.
“That’s your room. He’ll come back as mad as mad can be.”

“At least it will give us some time to think of something,” Anand
said. “He’ll take a while to locate the light switch. Let’s shout.”
All of a sudden there was a crash followed by a loud scream.
More strange noises emerged from the next room—a few
muffled thumps, an eerie whine, and a low, humming sound.
“My time machine, he’s started it!” Anand gasped. “I wish we
could get out of this room and see what is happening out there.”
There was another howl, much fainter this time, and a great
deal of clattering. We shouted for all we were worth. In a few
minutes, we heard footsteps running up our drive. Thankfully
we recognised Mrs. Sharma’s voice, along with her husband
and Dr. Mohan—also a neighbour.
“Anand! Anita! Children, what’s the matter? Where are you?”

“What on earth has been happening here, children?” Sharma
Uncle asked. Both Anand and I fell over ourselves trying to
explain. “Where is the fellow now?”
“The last we heard, he was in the time machine,” I explained
hastily, seeing everyone looking rather puzzled.

hastily: quickly

We entered the room cautiously and turned on the lights. The
time machine was still humming softly but otherwise there
was no other sound from the room.
“Well, where is he?” Dr. Mohan asked, peering behind the
door. “Did you imagine this?”

peering: looking
carefully

“Oh no,” I protested. “How could both of us have imagined the
same thing?”
“Maybe he ran out,” Anand suggested.
“I’m sure we’d have seen him. There’s only one way out of this
house and we came the same way as soon as we heard you,”
Sharma Uncle sounded very sure.
“Look!” Anand said, pointing to the floor. “He was wearing
that.” Near the panel of switches was the green scarf.

“Let’s search the house—perhaps he’s still around,” Dr. Mohan
said, going upstairs.
Boppa was nowhere to be seen. “Well maybe he did run out
and we missed him,” Mrs. Sharma said at last, “I can’t imagine
what else could have happened.”
“My time machine! He’s gone through that!” Anand burst out,
his eyes shining.
“What an imagination this boy has!” Mr. Sharma said, smiling
indulgently. “Now off to bed, both of you. I’ll spend the night
here so you needn’t worry about any more intruders now.”
Needless to say, Boppa was never
seen again. Anand insists that his time
machine worked and he disappeared
into the past. The machine itself was
dismantled because Papa thought it
wasn’t safe (maybe he also had a niggling
suspicion that it worked), so we couldn’t
try it out.
As for Anand, he is convinced that he
is a genius and has launched a new
project—something about a telephone
to contact creatures in outer space. Tell
you all about it next time.

I hope that someone in some strange land will find

them down the air to race with my boats!

Appa says that there used to be a lot more water, and
rafting was much scarier then.
I was fully wet by the time I was done, and Appa was
so scared that he decided never to go rafting ever again.
I love the water so much and can’t wait to go back.

Dear classmates,
Amma and Appa are fast asleep, and I should be sleeping
too, but I just love looking out of the window. I think we’re
in the southwest part of the country, in Goa, and you won’t
believe how nice the plateaus look. There are so many hills
here, and beaches too.
There are also a lot of tunnels that the
train goes through. I used to be afraid of
tunnels, but I’m not any more. Someday,
I wish we could all go on a tour of the
plateaus. Maybe when we’re in Class 11.
Love,
Shaana

Dear friends,
I can’t believe we’re in the same state again! We travelled
south, and I will be home soon.
We reached Chennai yesterday, and on the way to
Puducherry, we decided to learn how to surf. I think I’m
good at it now because I only fell down twice. Amma and
Appa splashed water on each other and behaved like
children. It’s a good thing I was there to control them.

surf: (here)

that involves
standing on a

The beaches here are not like the ones we have
on our island. The waves are a lot rougher and
the water is browner, but I still like it here.

Amma wanted to teach me how to dive, but they did not
have diving suits my size, so I spent the day floating and
looking at the fish while my parents dove below me.

Dear Amma and Appa,
I can’t believe we travelled across the whole country!
I know we’re going to miss visiting the forests, glaciers,
deserts, wetlands, plateaus, and mountains. And we are
going to miss hearing all those new languages and meeting
all those different people. But we’re finally home now, and
we can join our friends again.
I hope we get to travel like this again, and maybe next time
we can take our friends with us.

IV Read the following sentences from the text and underline the subject
and the verb.
1. Amma and Appa are fast asleep.
		 (When the subject of a sentence has two or more nouns or pronouns
that are connected by ‘and’, we use a plural verb).
2. It’s hot, dry, and there is sand everywhere.
		 (In case the subject is ‘it’, the verb that follows is either ‘is’ or ‘was’
depending on the tense of the sentence).
3. There are so many hills here, and beaches too.
		 (When we begin a sentence with ‘there’, the subject comes after the
verb).
The subject of a sentence is closely linked to the verb. The verb
form changes depending on whether the subject is singular or
plural and if it is in the third person. Choosing the correct verb
based on the subject is called subject-verb agreement.
		 Let us understand subject-verb agreement better.
• A subject and its verb must agree, even if other words or phrases come
between them.
		The formation of paragraphs is important in writing.
• When the subjects are considered individually, we use a singular verb.
		
Every man and woman has the right to vote.
• Collective nouns such as ‘class’, ‘committee’, ‘audience’, ‘team’ can be
singular or plural, based on the context of the sentence. If the sentence
implies the group is acting as one unit, the noun is singular and takes
a singular verb.
		The committee decides on the new policy tomorrow.
• The indefinite pronouns ‘each’, ‘either’, ‘every’, ‘much’, and ‘neither’
always require singular verbs.
		 Each of the children was given a gift.
• Subjects that look plural because they end in ‘s’ but refer to one thing
are singular.
		
Mathematics is an interesting subject.
• Some nouns (like glasses, scissors, pants, and tongs) are plural but take
a singular verb when the phrase ‘pair of’ is placed before it. Here,
‘pair’ is the subject.
		This pair of scissors is sharp.

statements from 1–7.

Father : Sai dear! What are you working on there with all that paper?
Sai

: Baba, I am trying to make an origami crane, but it’s a bit
tricky. I keep messing up the folds.

Father : Ah, origami! I remember doing that when I was your age.
You know, Sai, origami has a really interesting history.
Sai

: Really? I thought it was just something fun to do with
paper.

Father : It is fun, but it’s also an age-old art form. Origami started
in Japan over a thousand years ago. Back then, paper
was really expensive, so it was only used for special
occasions, like religious ceremonies.
Sai

: Wow, I didn’t know that. So, it wasn’t just for doing crafts?

Father : It wasn’t until the seventeenth century that people began
making animals, flowers and other designs just for fun.
Sai

: So, people have been making paper cranes for hundreds
of years?

Father : Yes, and the crane is especially important in Japanese
culture. It’s a symbol of peace and long life. There’s even
a belief that if you fold a thousand paper cranes, you can
make a wish, and it will come true.
Sai

: A thousand cranes? That’s a lot! But it sounds like a really
nice tradition.

Father : It is. Origami isn’t just about the final shape—it’s about
the process, the patience and the creativity involved.
And over the years, it’s spread all over the world, with
people adding their own styles and techniques.
Sai

: I had no idea origami had such a long history. It makes
folding this crane feel even more special.

Father : I’m glad you think so, Sai. Perhaps we can start with
something simpler next time. How about we make an

we’ll sail our paper boat.

Let us listen (refer to page 131)
		 You will listen to a girl speak about the story of how Agartala got its name
and the importance of agar. As you listen, choose the correct option for
the questions given below.

Hi everyone,
We all know that Agartala is the capital of Tripura. But did you
know how Agartala got its name? It’s made up of two words:
‘agar’, which is a type of tree, and ‘tala’, meaning underneath.
So, Agartala means ‘under the agar tree’. These trees are also
called aloeswood, eaglewood, or gharuwood. It is also referred
to as ‘wood of the gods’.
Agarwood, the wood from these trees, is really special. It smells
amazing—like a mix of woody and flowery scents. It is one of
the rarest and the most expensive woods in the world. People
have used it for thousands of years in medicines, perfumes and
rituals. It has been described as early as 1400 BCE in the Vedas.
The Egyptians are believed to have used agarwood incense as
part of their rituals more than 3,000 years ago.
Here’s something even more remarkable—agarwood only forms
when the tree is hurt or infected with a bug or virus. Instead of
dying, the tree creates this dark, sticky, sweet-smelling substance
called agar oil which protects it from further infection.
Agarwood is very important to people in Agartala. It’s used to
make perfumes, incense, and the hand carvings which Tripura
is famous for.

138

Unit 3.indd 138

And here’s the best part: the tree was once almost extinct, but
now, thanks to people taking care of it, you can find it in almost
every house in northern Tripura. How great is that!

It was almost noon, and the jungle was very still, very silent.
Heat waves shimmered along the railway embankment where
it cut a path through the tall evergreen trees. The railway lines
were two straight black serpents disappearing into the tunnel
in the hillside.
Suraj stood near the cutting, waiting for the midday train. It
wasn’t a station, and he wasn’t catching a train. He was waiting
so that he could watch the steam engine come roaring out of
the tunnel.
He had cycled out of the town and taken the jungle path until
he had come to a small village. He had left the cycle there, and
walked over a low scrub-covered hill and down to the tunnel
exit.
Now he looked up. He had heard, in the distance, the shrill
whistle of the engine. He couldn’t see anything, because
the train was approaching from the other side of the hill;

but presently a sound like distant thunder issued from the
tunnel, and he knew the train was coming through.

A second or two later, the steam engine shot out of the tunnel,
snorting and puffing like some green, black, and gold dragon,
some beautiful monster out of Suraj’s dreams. Showering
sparks left and right, it roared a challenge to the jungle.
Instinctively, Suraj stepped back a few paces. Waves of hot
steam struck him in the face. Even the trees seemed to flinch
from the noise and heat. And then the train had gone, leaving
only a plume of smoke to drift lazily over the tall shisham
trees.
The jungle was still again. No one moved.
Suraj turned from his contemplation of the drifting smoke and
began walking along the embankment towards the tunnel.
The tunnel grew darker as he walked further into it. When
he had gone about twenty yards, it became pitch dark. Suraj
had to turn and look back at the opening to reassure himself
that there was still daylight outside. Ahead of him, the tunnel’s
other opening was just a small round circle of light.

Suraj didn’t stop, because there was nothing to do in the tunnel
and nothing to see. He had simply wanted to walk through, so
that he would know what the inside of a tunnel was really
like. The walls were damp and sticky. A bat flew past. A lizard
scuttled between the lines.
Coming straight from the darkness into the light, Suraj was
dazzled by the sudden glare and put a hand up to shade his
eyes. He looked up at the tree-covered hillside and thought he
saw something moving between the trees.
It was just a flash of orange and gold,
and a long swishing tail. It was there
between the trees for a second or
two, and then it was gone.
About fifteen metres from the
entrance to the tunnel stood the
watchman’s hut. Marigolds grew in
front of the hut, and at the back there
was a small vegetable patch. It was
the watchman’s duty to inspect the
tunnel and keep it clear of obstacles.

obstacles:
things that
block the way
porcupine: a
small animal
(large rodent)
with sharp spikes
on its back

Every day, before the train came
through, he would walk the length of
the tunnel. If all was well, he would
return to his hut and take a nap. If something was wrong,
he would walk back up the line and wave a red flag, and the
engine driver would slow down. At night, the watchman lit
an oil lamp and made a similar inspection of the tunnel. Of
course, he would not stop the train if there was a porcupine
on the line. But if there was any danger to the train, he’d go
back up the line and wave his lamp to the approaching engine.
If all was well, he’d hang his lamp at the door of his hut and
go to sleep.
He was just settling down on his cot for an afternoon nap
when he saw the boy emerge from the tunnel. He waited until
Suraj was only a metre or so away and then said, “Welcome,
welcome. I don’t often have visitors. Sit down for a while, and
tell me why you were inspecting my tunnel.”
“Is it your tunnel?” asked Suraj.

“It is,” said the watchman. “It is truly my tunnel, since no one
else will have anything to do with it. I have only lent it to the
Government.”
Suraj sat down on the edge of the cot.
“I wanted to see the train come through,” he said. “And then,
when it had gone, I thought I’d walk through the tunnel.”
“And what did you find in it?”
“Nothing. It was very dark. But when I came out, I thought I
saw an animal—up on the hill—but I’m not sure, it moved off
very quickly.”
“It was a leopard you saw,” said the watchman. “My leopard.”
“Do you own a leopard too?”
“I do.”
“And do you lend it to the Government?”
“I do not.”
“Is it dangerous?”
“No, it’s a leopard that minds its own business. It comes to this
range for a few days every month.”

“Have you been here a long time?” asked Suraj.
“Many years. My name is Sunder Singh.”

during the night. Have you seen the night mail come through
the tunnel?”
“No. At what time does it come?”
“About nine o’clock, if it isn’t late. You could come and sit here
with me, if you like. And after it has gone, instead of going to
sleep I will take you home.”
“I’ll ask my parents,” said Suraj. “Will it be safe?”
“Of course. It is safer in the jungle than in the town. Nothing
happens to me out here. But last month, when I went into
town, I was almost run over by a bus.”
Sunder Singh yawned and stretched himself out on the cot.
“And now I am going to take a nap, my friend. It is too hot to
be up and about in the afternoon.”
“Everyone goes to sleep in the afternoon,” complained Suraj.
“My father lies down as soon as he’s had his lunch.”
“Well, the animals also rest in the heat of the day. It is only the
tribe of boys who cannot, or will not, rest.”
Sunder Singh placed a large banana leaf over his face to
keep away the flies, and was soon snoring gently. Suraj stood
up, looking up and down the railway tracks. Then he began
walking back to the village.

The following evening, towards dusk, as the flying foxes
swooped silently out of the trees, Suraj made his way to the
watchman’s hut.
It had been a long hot day, but now the earth was cooling, and
a light breeze was moving through the trees. It carried with it
the scent of mango blossoms, the promise of rain.
Sunder Singh was waiting for Suraj. He had watered his small
garden, and the flowers looked cool and fresh. A kettle was
boiling on a small oil stove.
“I am making tea,” he said. “There is nothing like a glass of hot
tea while waiting for a train.”
They drank their tea, listening to the sharp notes of the
tailorbird and the noisy chatter of the seven sisters.

As the brief twilight faded, most of the birds fell silent. Sunder
Singh lit his oil lamp and said it was time for him to inspect the
tunnel. He moved off towards the tunnel, while Suraj sat on
the cot, sipping his tea. In the dark, the trees seemed to move
closer to him. And the nightlife of the forest was conveyed on
the breeze—the sharp call of a barking deer, the cry of a fox,
the quaint tonk-tonk of a nightjar. There were some sounds
that Suraj didn’t recognise—sounds that came from the trees,
creakings and whisperings, as though the trees were coming to
life, stretching their limbs in the dark, shifting a little, flexing
their fingers.
Sunder Singh stood inside the tunnel, trimming his lamp.
The night sounds were familiar to him and he did not give
them much thought; but something else—a padded footfall, a
rustle of dry leaves—made him stand still for a few seconds,
peering into the darkness. Then, humming softly to himself, he
returned to where Suraj was waiting. Ten minutes remained
for the night mail to arrive.
As Sunder Singh sat down on the cot beside Suraj, a new sound
reached both of them quite distinctly—a rhythmic sawing
sound, as if someone cutting through the branch of a tree.
“What’s that?” whispered Suraj.
“It’s the leopard,” said Sunder Singh. “I think it’s in the tunnel.”
“The train will soon be here,” said Suraj.
“Yes, my friend. And if we don’t drive the leopard out of the
tunnel, it will be run over and killed. I can’t let that happen.”
“But won’t it attack us if we try to drive it out?” asked Suraj,
beginning to share the watchman’s concern.
“Not this leopard. It knows me well. We have seen each other
many times. It has a weakness for goats and stray dogs, but it
will not harm us. Even so, I’ll take my axe with me. You stay
here, Suraj.”
“No, I’m coming with you. It will be better than sitting here
alone in the dark!”
“All right, but stay close behind me. And remember, there is
nothing to fear.”

Raising his lamp, Sunder Singh advanced into the tunnel,
shouting at the top of his voice to try and scare away the
animal. Suraj followed close behind, but he found he was
unable to do any shouting. His throat was quite dry.

They had gone about twenty paces into the tunnel when the
light from the lamp fell upon the leopard. It was crouching
between the tracks, only five metres away from them. It was
not a very big leopard, but it looked lithe and sinewy. Baring
its teeth and snarling, it went down on its belly, tail twitching.
Suraj and Sunder Singh both shouted together. Their voices
rang through the tunnel. And the leopard, uncertain as to how
many terrifying humans were there in the tunnel with him,
turned swiftly and disappeared into the darkness.
To make sure that it had gone, Sunder Singh and Suraj walked
the length of the tunnel. When they returned to the entrance,
the rails were beginning to hum. They knew the train was
coming.
Suraj put his hand to one of the rails and felt its tremor. He
heard the distant rumble of the train. And then the engine
came round the bend, hissing at them, scattering sparks into
the darkness, defying the jungle as it roared through the steep

sides of the cutting. It charged straight at the tunnel, and into it,
thundering past Suraj like the beautiful dragon of his dreams.
And when it had gone, the silence returned and the forest
seemed to breathe, to live again. Only the
rails still trembled with the passing of
the train.
They trembled again to the passing of the
same train, almost a week later, when
Suraj and his father were both travelling
in it.
Suraj’s father was scribbling in a
notebook, doing his accounts. Suraj sat
at an open window staring out at the
darkness. His father was going to Delhi
on a business trip and had decided
to take the boy along. (“I don’t know
where he gets to, most of the time,” he’d
complained. “I think it’s time he learnt
something about my business.”)

The night mail rushed through the forest with its hundreds of
passengers. The carriage wheels beat out a steady rhythm on
the rails. Tiny flickering lights came and went, as they passed
small villages on the fringe of the jungle.
Suraj heard the rumble as the train passed over a small bridge.
It was too dark to see the hut near the cutting, but he knew
they must be approaching the tunnel. He strained his eyes
looking out into the night; and then, just as the engine let out
a shrill whistle, Suraj saw the lamp.
He couldn’t see Sunder Singh, but he saw the lamp, and he
knew that his friend was out there.
The train went into the tunnel and out again; it left the jungle
behind and thundered across the endless plains.
Suraj stared out at the darkness, thinking of the lonely cutting
in the forest and the watchman with the lamp, who would
always remain a firefly for those travelling thousands as he lit
up the darkness for steam engines and leopards.

III Read what the watchman Sunder Singh did regularly at the tunnel as
part of his duty. Notice the use of ‘would’.
		
Every day, before the train came through, he would walk the length of
the tunnel. If all was well, he would return to his hut and take a nap. If
something was wrong, he would walk back up the line and wave a red flag
and the engine driver would slow down. At night, the watchman lit an oil
lamp and made a similar inspection of the tunnel.
1. Why is the word ‘would’ used here?
(i) to make a polite request
(ii) to express a desire
(iii) to talk about a habit in the past
		 In these sentences, the word ‘would’ is used to speak about a past habit.
‘Would’ is used in these sentences to describe repeated activities for
a period of time in the past. We call them ‘habitual or routine actions
in the past’.
		
Would and used to both describe something that happened regularly in
the past. However, ‘used to’ indicates a past action that doesn’t happen
any longer.
• I used to paint when I was in Grade 4.
• Riya used to eat a lot of junk food, but she stopped last year.

IV We use punctuation marks to make our writing clear. You already know
how to use full stops and commas. Let us look at three more punctuation
marks—brackets, semicolon, and colon.
		 Colon (:) is used to introduce a list or an explanation.
• You need the following ingredients to make Ela Ada: ghee, coconut,
jaggery, and rice flour.
• He has one goal: to win the championship.
		 Semicolon (;) is used to connect two clauses which are closely related
without a conjunction.
• She loves reading; he prefers watching movies.
• Suraj followed close behind; but he found he was unable to do any
shouting.
		 Now, use semicolons and colons to punctuate the following paragraph.

I The Nation’s pride Atal Tunnel is 9.02 kilometres long. It runs under the
Rohtang Pass. It was constructed on the Manali–Leh Highway under the
challenging conditions of freezing temperatures in extremely difficult
terrain. The Atal Tunnel has officially been certified by World Book of
Records as the ‘World’s Longest Highway Tunnel above 10,000 Feet’!

II The history of Indian Railways spans over 165 years. On 16 April 1853,
the first passenger train ran between Bori Bunder (Mumbai) and Thane,
covering 34 kilometres. It was operated by three locomotives named
Sahib, Sultan, and Sindh and had thirteen carriages. In 1864, the North
received its first station, Delhi Junction, near Chandni Chowk.

The railroad track is miles away,
And the day is loud with voices speaking,
Yet there isn’t a train goes by all day
But I hear its whistle shrieking.
All night there isn’t a train goes by,
Though the night is still for sleep and dreaming,
But I see its cinders red on the sky,
And hear its engine steaming.
My heart is warm with the friends I make,
And better friends I’ll not be knowing;
Yet there isn’t a train I wouldn’t take,
No matter where it’s going.

II Now, listen to the announcement again and rectify the sentences.

Let us speak
When speaking in English, small differences in pronunciation can change the
overall meaning of the words. One such difference is in the pronunciation of
the consonant ‘c’.
For example: cat (uses /k/ sound for ‘c’) and city (uses the /s/ sound for ‘c’)
The poem uses the word ‘cinders’, which is pronounced with a /s/ sound.

The letter ‘c’ has two sounds. It can be pronounced as a /k/ or /s/ sound.
But which is right depends on the next letters of the words.
• Letter ‘c’ produces /s/ sound if it is followed by the letters ‘e’, ‘i’,
or ‘y’. For example, city (‘c’ is followed by ‘i’). This /s/ sound is
known as the soft ‘c’ sound.
• Letter ‘c’ produces /k/ sound if it is followed by the letters ‘a’, ‘o’,
or ‘u’ or a consonant at the end of the word. For example, cat (‘c’
is followed by ‘a’). This /k/ sound is known as the hard ‘c’ sound.

That is why ‘cinders’ is pronounced with a /s/ sound. The letter ‘c’ is followed
by ‘i’!
Now, work in pairs. Pronounce the given words aloud. Keep the rules of the
soft and hard ‘c’ pronunciation in mind.

railways and they are designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site
under the name Mountain Railways of India. These three railways are
the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, the Nilgiri Mountain Railway, and the
Kalka–Shimla Railway.
		The Matheran Hill Railway and Kangra Valley Railway are on the
tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
		They are still fully operational as living examples of the ingenious
engineering enterprise of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. The owner of the three properties is the Railway Ministry of
the Indian Government.

Let us read
This is a story that narrates the triumph of will,
courage, determination, and dedication. Arunima
Sinha’s journey from a devastating accident to
scaling the highest peak in the world stands as a
beacon of hope and resilience. In 2011, at the age
of 24, Arunima Sinha, a national-level volleyball
player, faced a life-altering event. It challenged
her in ways she could never have imagined. As
she lay in the hospital bed with one leg amputated,
Arunima made a vow that many would deem
impossible: not only to walk again with a
prosthetic leg but to scale Mount Everest. In 2013,
she did just that, becoming the first Indian female
amputee to achieve this feat. Hence, in 2015, she
was awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest
civilian award in India. She was also awarded the
Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award and
National Award for Best Female Mountaineer.

Courtesy: Hindustan Times

Arunima hails from Ambedkar Nagar, a small district in Uttar
Pradesh. Her father was an army engineer, and her mother
worked as a health supervisor. Sports were a significant part
of Arunima’s life, with her family having a natural inclination
towards athletics. After completing her law degree following
her post-graduation, Arunima decided to pursue a job in the
paramilitary forces, which would allow her to continue her
passion for sports while having a regular income.
On the fateful night of 11 April 2011, she met with a train
accident. The hours that followed were harrowing. She never
imagined she would survive that night, but survive she did,
miraculously, displaying an extraordinary will to live. Arunima
received a prosthetic leg and underwent physiotherapy. It was
during this period that she made a profound decision. Inspired
by an article about Mount Everest, she resolved to conquer
the highest peak in the world.
To pursue her ambition, Arunima Sinha completed a
basic mountaineering course at the Nehru Institute of
Mountaineering in Uttarkashi, followed by eighteen months
of rigorous training. Arunima approached Bachendri Pal, the

first Indian woman to summit Everest, to guide her in the
endeavour. Bachendri Pal instilled confidence in Arunima
and said, “My child, you decided to climb Mount Everest in
these situations with a prosthetic leg—you have conquered
the Everest within you; the world will realise it later.”
On 21 May 2013, after 52 exhausting days, Arunima Sinha
reached the summit of Mount Everest. Standing at the top
of the world, she felt a surge of emotions—pride, relief, and
an overwhelming sense of achievement. She displayed the
Indian flag at the summit and left behind a photograph of her
idol, Swami Vivekananda, whose teachings had inspired her
throughout her journey.
Arunima’s feat did not end with Everest. By July 2016, she
had summited seven peaks in Europe, Africa, Australia,
South America, North America, and
of course, Mount Everest in Asia.
In January 2019, she climbed the
seventh peak on Antarctica and
became world’s first female amputee
to climb Mount Vinson. Her goal to
complete the Seven Summits was
achieved.
Throughout her journey, Arunima
has faced numerous challenges and
setbacks. Yet, her story is not just about
physical endurance but
also about mental

fortitude and the power of a positive mind set. Her message is
simple yet profound: “Never give up and work hard. Always
remember your goal and work on it.”
Arunima’s autobiography, Born Again on the Mountain: A Story
of Losing Everything and Finding It Back records her incredible
journey to the top of the world. It is a story of triumph over
adversity, a testament to the human spirit’s capacity to rise
above the most challenging circumstances.
She was conferred with the honorary doctorate by the
University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK. In her words, “Failure
is not when we fall short of achieving our goals. It is when
we don’t have goals worthy enough. Never forget your goal,
respect it, work hard, and you will be the winner.” Dr. Arunima
Sinha has not only conquered mountains but has also won
people’s hearts the world over, inspiring them to reach their
own summits.

I’m quite worried about the safety risks of adventure
sports. It’s important to consider these risks before
letting children participate.
Speaker (ii): Adventure sports are thrilling! All my friends
agree; it is amazing. It’s not just about fun; it’s about
pushing your limits and experiencing something
new. I think it’s worth trying, of course, with a
trainer.
Speaker (iii): As organisers of adventure camps, we take safety
very seriously. Our team ensures all equipment is
regularly checked and maintained. Participants are
given thorough training and are always supervised
by professionals. We focus on minimising risks
while still providing an exciting experience.
Speaker (iv): At our school, we organise adventure camps with
activities like trekking and zip-lining. However, we
stick to basic sports that are safe and manageable
for students. We always prioritise safety, ensuring
that all necessary precautions and measures are in
place. Being careful is what we promote.
Speaker (v): In my opinion, sports should be about fitness and
enjoyment, like track and field or swimming. Why
risk your life for a fleeting moment of thrill just for
a feeling of adventure? Traditional sports are safer
and just as fulfilling!

Two friends share their feelings about brave soldiers. One
of them shares her experience of visiting the National War
Memorial that has left a deep impact on her. They exchange
letters and share their feelings of gratitude for the freedom
they enjoy because of the sacrifices made by the bravehearts of
the country. The memorial symbolises the patriotism of Indian
soldiers. Which is this memorial?

nation’s borders

Do you remember our last conversation about war and the
importance of peace? We talked about how India had to
struggle for its Independence from the British for many
centuries. Post-independence our country has had to fight
several wars to protect its borders, territorial integrity, and its
people. This made me wonder, who were these brave Indian
people? They fought to protect our country and sacrificed their
lives so that we could lead our lives in peace. What were their
names? Where did they come from? Does anyone remember
anything about them?
Last week I got the answers to some of my questions during
an educational trip to New Delhi organised by our school. You
may recall, I was looking forward to this trip and our visit
to many places of historical and educational significance.
I learnt several new and interesting things, and I am excited
to share them with you.

Let me begin by asking you to guess the name of the monument
that I found most inspiring. Let’s see if you can guess. The
construction of this monument started in April 2018 and
was completed in February 2019. It was envisioned and then
inaugurated by India’s Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi

in February 2019. In terms of location and size, it is spread
over 40 acres of land near the iconic India Gate. But more
importantly, it is a tribute to some of the bravest Indians. I’m
sure you’ve guessed! It’s the ‘National War Memorial’. Won’t
you say, a long-desired aspiration was fulfilled?
Our visit to the National War Memorial began with our teacher
explaining that even after Independence, India has had to fight
many wars to protect herself, and the freedom and security
we enjoy today is because of the many brave men and women
who have served in the Indian Armed Forces over decades.
Sadly, she said, war always takes its toll, and therefore, many
brave soldiers have had to sacrifice their lives for the country
even after our Independence in 1947.
This is what makes monuments like the National War Memorial
extremely important, so that we should never forget the cost
of freedom. We are aware, always, of the pain and horrors
of war. We learnt that each brick of the memorial is called a
tablet, and it bears the names of soldiers who fought for India
and made the supreme sacrifice in different wars from 1947
till date, including the Indo-China conflict of 1962, the IndoPak Wars in 1965 & 1971 and the Kargil War in 1999. There
are 29,000 tablets on which more than 26,000 names of fallen
soldiers have been etched.
It was heartening to know that our government has recognised
the sacrifice of brave soldiers. Our teacher told us about the 21
bravehearts who were awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC),
India’s highest wartime gallantry medal, for their service to
the nation. She also told us about Maha Vir Chakra (MVC),
Kirti Chakra (KC), Vir Chakra (VrC), and Shaurya Chakra (SC).
Major Somnath Sharma was posthumously awarded India’s
first PVC in the Battle of Badgam in 1947. Later some more
PVCs were awarded for exceptional gallantry during the IndiaChina Conflict of 1962, and the India-Pakistan War of 1965.
Besides, a PVC was also awarded for service during the UN
Peace Keeping Operations in Congo.

including Captain Mahendra Nath Mulla were also awarded

Then the teacher shared with us the citation of Param Vir Chakra
awardee Lance Naik Albert Ekka. It touched my heart and also
motivated me. We were awestruck and humbled by his bravery.
I aspire to be courageous like him when I join the army!

Lance Naik Albert Ekka (PVC)

Citation
Lance Naik Albert Ekka, (No. 4239746), 14 Guards
Lance Naik Albert Ekka was in the left forward company of a
Battalion of the Brigade of Guards during their attack on the enemy
defence at Gangasagar on the eastern front. This was a well-fortified
position held in strength by the enemy. The assaulting troops were
subjected to intense shelling and heavy small arms fire, but they
charged on to the objective and were locked in bitter hand-to-hand
combat. Lance Naik Albert Ekka noticed an enemy Light Machine
Gun inflicting heavy casualties on his company. With complete
disregard to his personal safety, he charged the enemy bunker,
bayoneted two enemy soldiers and silenced the Light Machine Gun.
Though seriously wounded in this encounter, he continued to fight
alongside his comrades through the mile deep objective, clearing
bunker after bunker with undaunted courage. Towards the northern
end of the objective, one enemy Medium Machine Gun opened up
from the second storey of a well-fortified building inflicting heavy
casualties and holding up the attack. Once again, this gallant soldier
without worrying about his personal safety, despite his serious
injury and the heavy volume of enemy fire, crawled forward till he
reached the building and lobbed a grenade through the loophole of

182

the bunker, killing one enemy and injuring the other.
The Medium Machine Gun, however, continued to fire. With
outstanding courage and grim determination, Lance Naik Albert
Ekka scaled a side wall and entering the bunker, bayoneted the
enemy who was still firing and thus silenced the Machine Gun,
saving further casualties to his company and ensured the success
of the attack.
In this process, however, he received serious injuries and succumbed
to them after the capture of the objective. In this action, Lance Naik
Albert Ekka displayed the most conspicuous valour, determination
and made the supreme sacrifice in the best traditions of the Army.

As we continued our visit around the National War Memorial,
we came across another important installation called Amar
Jawan Jyoti that commemorates our soldiers. The name, as
you may have guessed, represents an immortal flame that
is kept ablaze all through the day and night to revere the
sacrifices of our soldiers. Earlier the Amar Jawan Jyoti, which
also displayed a rifle and a helmet, was alighted under the
arch of India Gate in January 1972 to commemorate India’s
victory in the India-Pakistan War of 1971.
The National War Memorial now includes Amar
Jawan Jyoti in the obelisk, which is surrounded by
four Chakras. During the inauguration, the Prime
Minister lit a new flame to commemorate the fallen
heroes. Later, the old flame at India Gate was also
merged with the new flame at the National War
Memorial. Here is a picture of the new Amar Jawan
Jyoti if you haven’t seen it.
You can see the obelisk surrounded by wreaths
that have been placed as a mark of respect. The
lighting design is planned in such a way that it
transforms the monument’s landscape as sunlight
changes from dawn to dusk. It truly is a majestic
site that filled me with pride for our nation. I was
also overwhelmed by the interminable flame as a
metaphor for eternal stories of courage and valour.

Our teacher also explained the significance of the Chakras to
us. I found it interesting and hence I am sharing with you.

The National War Memorial consists of four concentric circles,
which are known as Amar Chakra, Veerta Chakra, Tyag Chakra,
and Raksha Chakra around a 15-metre-tall central obelisk
with the eternal flame—the Amar Jawan Jyoti. It also houses
bronze and stone murals and graphic panels. Isn’t it amazing!
The innermost circle represents the Amar Chakra, also
known as the ‘Circle of Immortality’. This has the Obelisk with
Eternal Flame. The Amar Jawan Jyoti flame symbolises the
immortality of the spirit of fallen soldiers with the assurance
that the nation will never forget their sacrifice.
The second circle is called the Veerta Chakra, which is also
known as the ‘Circle of Bravery’. There is a covered gallery
that exhibits six murals crafted in bronze, depicting valiant
battle actions of our Armed Forces.
The third circle represents the Tyag Chakra, also known
as the ‘Circle of Sacrifice’. The circular concentric walls of
honour symbolise the ancient war formation, which is called
Chakravyuh. The walls are covered with granite tablets and

individual tablet is solely dedicated to each fallen hero of postIndependent India. Their names are etched in golden letters.
The outermost circle represents the Raksha Chakra, which
is also known as the ‘Circle of Protection’. In this chakra the
row of trees is a reassurance to the citizens of the country
about their safety against any threat. Each tree represents the
soldiers who ensure the territorial integrity of the nation.
We spent the whole day, from morning to evening, at the
National War Memorial and the surrounding areas, marked by
majestic lawns and grand buildings of Kartavyapath. We were
immersed in the ambience that was solemn and a reminder
of what a free nation could achieve. The overall environment
created an emotive experience that was visually inspiring. I
felt as if I had developed a bond with the place.
I learnt a lot, but I also have to admit that the various discourses
during the day brought tears to my eyes. It was sad to think
about the massive devastation and loss of life caused by wars.
It motivated me to live a life worthy of the sacrifices of our
heroes.

Citation
Major Padmapani Acharya (IC-55072) 2 Rajputana Rifles
(Posthumous)
On 28 June 1999, Major Padmapani Acharya as a Company Commander,
was assigned the formidable task of capturing an enemy position
which was heavily fortified, strongly held and covered with mines and
sweeping machine gun and artillery fire.
Success of the battalion and brigade operation hinged on the early
capture of this position. However, the company attack almost faltered at
the very beginning when the enemy’s artillery fire came down squarely
on the leading platoon, inflicting large number of casualties.
With utter disregard to his personal safety, Major Padmapani Acharya
took the reserve platoon of his company and led it through raining
artillery shells. Even as his men were falling to the murderous enemy
fire, he continued to encourage his men and charged at the enemy up
the steep rock face with his reserve platoon.
Unmindful of the hail of bullets from the enemy’s position, Major
Padmapani Acharya crawled up to the enemy position and lobbed
grenades. In this daring assault, Major Acharya was severely injured.
Despite being seriously injured and unable to move, he ordered his men
to leave him and charge at the enemy while he continued to fire at the
enemy. The enemy position was finally over-run and the objective was
captured.
After completion of the mission, the officer however, succumbed to his
injuries.
Major Padmapani Acharya displayed exceptional courage, leadership
and spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of the enemy.

Before he went into battle, he wrote a letter to his father that
he wasn’t afraid or scared about losing his life while trying to
protect the motherland. Quoting Shrimad Bhagavad Gita he went
on to say:

It was such a pleasure to receive your letter. I enjoyed reading
your experience of the visit to the National War Memorial in

of the emotions associated with this memorial.

I was happy to hear that you got an opportunity to visit the
National War Memorial. I have heard a lot about it. Some
people might see a war memorial as just a monument,
statue, an edifice to celebrate our war heroes or victory and
commemorate those who lost their lives or got injured in the
war. In my view, it is also an expression of deep gratitude for
the supreme sacrifice made by our brave soldiers defending
the sovereignty and integrity of the country. I feel motivated
and I am seriously thinking of joining the Armed Forces to
serve my motherland.
I also feel it is our duty to periodically visit such places to
honour our valiant soldiers, who have made great sacrifices
for us. Their sacrifices enable us to walk freely in our country
without fear of enemy threats. It is nice of your teacher and
school to arrange this visit to give you all a chance to learn
about India’s heroes and also pay your respect to them. The
idea of your class to make a presentation at the school and
make everyone a part of your experience is wonderful! Best of

luck for your presentation, I hope it goes well and motivates the
school students to join the Indian Armed Forces.
Your letter has reminded me of a time when we visited the war
memorial in our city. While visiting one of Chandigarh’s gardens,
we saw a lot of activity around the Bougainvillea Garden in Sector 3.
As we approached the garden, we saw people offering flowers and
prayers. We joined the group out of curiosity and quickly realised
that they were all there to pay respect to the soldiers at the War
Memorial located in the heart of the garden.
When I think back about my visit where everyone was dedicating
flowers as a mark of respect to our soldiers, I was reminded of
the following poem:

I hope you like the poem. I must say, I was inspired by your
idea of presenting the valourous stories of India’s soldiers.
There are so many stories of courage, bravery and sacrifice
which remind us that many of the challenges we face in our
lives are inconsequential. We can enjoy peace in our country
and the luxury of exchanging ideas with our friends because
our Armed Forces are alert and work hard to create that
environment for us.
Very recently, I read in the

officer of the 17 Jat regiment was
posthumously awarded the Maha

I know that we can email each other. I really like to receive

but also because the envelope of your letters often comes with
beautiful stamps, which make me happy. I don’t know if I ever
shared it before, but collecting stamps is one of my favourite

Oh! Defenders of borders
You are great sons of my land
When we are all asleep
You still hold on to your deed

Climbing the heights or striding the valleys
Defending the deserts or guarding the marshes
Surveillance in seas and by securing the air
Prime of your youth given to the nation!!
Wind chimes of my land vibrate your feat
We pray for you brave men!!
May the Lord bless you all!!

Homage to Our Brave Soldiers
Let us listen (refer to page 196)
		 You will listen to a girl speak about why she wishes to join the Armed
Forces when she grows up. As you listen, answer the questions given
below in two–three exact words you hear.

Good morning, respected teachers and my dear friends.
Today, I, Gunjan, of Grade 7-C, stand before you to share why I
dream of joining the Indian Armed Forces when I grow up.
Serving our country is the most honourable job one can have.
It means protecting and securing our nation, even if it means
risking one’s life. The thought of wearing the uniform, which
can only be earned through hard work, fills me with pride and a
strong desire to serve India.
The Armed Forces teach you to live a disciplined and organised
life. This keeps both the mind and body active. Soldiers are always
ready to face challenges because of this discipline. Additionally,
regular exercise and training keep soldiers physically fit and
ready for any situation. This preparation is something I greatly
admire and wish to achieve.
Lastly, being a soldier means having new experiences and
adventures everyday. Each day brings new challenges, teaching
important lessons, and helping one grow. The Armed Forces
offer a life filled with honour, self-respect, safety, and security
for both the soldier and their families. It is a life that teaches
loyalty, duty, service, and honesty.
This is why I want to join the Indian Armed Forces.

My Dear Soldiers
Let us listen (refer to page 203)
I Think and complete the poem titled ‘A Soldier’s Pride’.
II Now, listen to the poem and correct your answers wherever required.

In fields so vast, our soldiers stand,
With hearts so brave, and firm command,
They guard our land both night and day,
To keep our fears and foes at bay.
With every dawn and setting sun,
Their duty calls, it must be done,
Through stormy skies and blazing heat,
They march along with steady feet.
For love of land, they fight and strive,
To keep our hopes and dreams alive,
With pride and honour, they defend,
Our India, till the very end.

Rani Abbakka
Let us listen (refer to page 220)
You will listen to the teacher speak about a braveheart. As you listen,
complete the bio-table given below.

Hello children, you all have read about Rani Abbakka. Let me
share with you some details about one more braveheart. Her
name is Rani Gaidinliu.
Gaidinliu was born on 26 January 1915, in the present-day
Tamenglong district of Manipur. She was a Naga leader who led
an armed uprising against the British in Manipur, Nagaland, and
Assam. Gaidinliu belonged to the Rongmei tribe, also known as
the Kabui tribe.

Bravehearts

In 1927, at the age of 13, Gaidinliu joined the Heraka movement.
This movement aimed at the revival of the Naga tribal religion
and the establishment of self-rule for the Nagas, ending
British rule.
Gaidinliu was arrested in 1932 when she was just 16 and was
sentenced to life imprisonment by the British rulers. Between
1932 and 1947, she was kept in several prisons across the
Northeast.
After being released in 1947, she continued to work for the
betterment of her community. The then Prime Minister described
Gaidinliu as the ‘Daughter of the Hills’ and gave her the title ‘Rani’
for her courage. She was also awarded the Padma Bhushan in
1982.
In 1991, Rani Gaidinliu returned to her birthplace, where she
died on 17 February 1993 at the age of 78. Rani Gaidinliu was
conferred the Birsa Munda Award posthumously.
The State Government has developed a park along with a statue
to honour Rani Gaidinliu in Silchar, Assam. Not only that, the
Government of India issued a postal stamp in her honour in 1996
and a commemorative coin in 2015.
What a braveheart indeed!
