FOREWORD

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends that children’s life at school must
be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish
learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and
community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement
this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly
further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on
Education (NPE), 1986.

The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to
encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.
We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging
with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis
of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in
learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in
the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the
required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching
and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at
school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried
to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different
stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for
contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on
experience.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard
work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the
Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the
Chief Advisor for this book, Professor A.W. Joshi for guiding the work of this committee. Several
teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for
making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously
permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to
the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary
and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of
Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As
an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its
products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further
revision and refinement.

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOKS

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on
students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the
content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative
mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise
the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT
across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:

• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same
class

• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject

• Difficulty level

• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions
from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-
learning

• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes
given above.

PREFACE

It gives me pleasure to place this book in the hands of the students, teachers and the public at
large (whose role cannot be overlooked). It is a natural sequel to the Class XI textbook which
was brought out in 2006. This book is also a trimmed version of the textbooks which existed so
far. The chapter on thermal and chemical effects of current has been cut out. This topic has also
been dropped from the CBSE syllabus. Similarly, the chapter on communications has been
substantially curtailed. It has been rewritten in an easily comprehensible form.

Although most other chapters have been based on the earlier versions, several parts and
sections in them have been rewritten. The Development Team has been guided by the feedback
received from innumerable teachers across the country.

In producing these books, Class XI as well as Class XII, there has been a basic change of
emphasis. Both the books present physics to students without assuming that they would pursue
this subject beyond the higher secondary level. This new view has been prompted by the various
observations and suggestions made in the National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005.
Similarly, in today’s educational scenario where students can opt for various combinations of
subjects, we cannot assume that a physics student is also studying mathematics. Therefore,
physics has to be presented, so to say, in a standalone form.

As in Class XI textbook, some interesting box items have been inserted in many chapters.
They are not meant for teaching or examinations. Their purpose is to catch the attention of the
reader, to show some applications in daily life or in other areas of science and technology, to
suggest a simple experiment, to show connection of concepts in different areas of physics, and
in general, to break the monotony and enliven the book.

Features like Summary, Points to Ponder, Exercises and Additional Exercises at the end of
each chapter, and Examples have been retained. Several concept-based Exercises have been
transferred from end-of-chapter Exercises to Examples with Solutions in the text. It is hoped
that this will make the concepts discussed in the chapter more comprehensible. Several new
examples and exercises have been added. Students wishing to pursue physics further would
find Points to Ponder and Additional Exercises very useful and thoughtful. To provide resources
beyond the textbook  and to encourage eLearning, each chapter has been provided with
some relevant website addresses under the title ePhysics. These sites provide additional
material on specific topics and also provide learners with opportunites for interactive
demonstrations/experiments.

The intricate concepts of physics must be understood, comprehended and appreciated.
Students must learn to ask questions like ‘why’, ‘how’, ‘how do we know it’. They will find
almost always that the question ‘why’ has no answer within the domain of physics and science
in general. But that itself is a learning experience, is it not? On the other hand, the question
‘how’ has been reasonably well answered by physicists in the case of most natural phenomena.
In fact, with the understanding of how things happen, it has been possible to make use of many
phenomena to create technological applications for the use of humans.

For example, consider statements in a book, like ‘A negatively charged electron is attracted
by the positively charged plate’, or ‘In this experiment, light (or electron) behaves like a wave’.
You will realise that it is not possible to answer ‘why’. This question belongs to the domain of
philosophy or metaphysics. But we can answer ‘how’, we can find the force acting, we can find

the wavelength of the photon (or electron), we can determine how things behave under different
conditions, and we can develop instruments which will use these phenomena to our advantage.

It has been a pleasure to work for these books at the higher secondary level, along with a
team of members. The Textbook Development Team, Review Team and Editing Teams involved
college and university teachers, teachers from Indian Institutes of Technology, scientists from
national institutes and laboratories, as well as, higher secondary teachers. The feedback and
critical look provided by higher secondary teachers in the various teams are highly laudable.
Most box items were generated by members of one or the other team, but three of them were
generated by friends and well-wishers not part of any team. We are thankful to Dr P.N. Sen of
Pune, Professor Roopmanjari Ghosh of Delhi and Dr Rajesh B Khaparde of Mumbai for allowing
us to use their box items, respectively, in Chapters 3, 4 (Part I) and 9 (Part II). We are thankful
to the members of the review and editing workshops to discuss and refine the first draft of the
textbook.  We also express our gratitude to Prof. Krishna Kumar, Director, NCERT, for entrusting
us with the task of presenting this textbook as a part of the national effort for improving science
education. I also thank Prof. G. Ravindra, Joint Director, NCERT,  for his help from time-to-
time. Prof. Hukum Singh, Head, Department of Education in Science and Mathematics, NCERT,
was always willing to help us in our endeavour in every possible way.

We welcome suggestions and comments from our valued users, especially students and
teachers. We wish our young readers a happy journey into the exciting realm of physics.

ELECTRIC CHARGES
AND FIELDS

1.1  INTRODUCTION

All of us have the experience of seeing a spark or hearing a crackle when
we take off our synthetic clothes or sweater, particularly in dry weather.
Have you ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another
common example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the
sky during thunderstorms. We also experience a sensation of an electric
shock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a
bus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is
discharge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated
due to rubbing of insulating surfaces. You might have also heard that
this is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we
are going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static means anything
that does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with
the study of forces, fields and potentials arising from
static charges.

1.2  ELECTRIC CHARGE

Historically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with
wool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece,
around 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word

elektron meaning amber. Many such pairs of materials were known which
on rubbing could attract light objects like straw, pith balls and bits of
papers.

It was observed that if two glass rods rubbed with wool or silk cloth
are brought close to each other, they repel each other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The
two strands of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with which the rods were
rubbed, also repel each other. However, the glass rod and wool attracted
each other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat’s fur repelled each
other [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur. On the other hand, the plastic
rod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk or wool with
which the glass rod is rubbed. The glass rod repels the fur.

These seemingly simple facts  were established from years of efforts
and careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many
careful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of
an entry which is called the electric charge. We say that the bodies like
glass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire
an electric charge on rubbing. There are two kinds of electrification and
we find  that (i) like charges repel and (ii) unlike charges attract each
other. The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is called
the polarity of charge.

When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of
charge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for
any pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified
glass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they
no longer attract each other. They also do not attract or repel other light
objects as they did on being electrified.

Thus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged
bodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these
observations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects
neutralise or nullify each other’s effect. Therefore, the charges were named
as positive and negative by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.
By convention, the charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and
that on plastic rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an
electric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge
it is said to be electrically neutral.

Electric Charges
and Fields

A simple apparatus to detect charge on a body is the gold-leaf
electroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a
box, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged
object touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to
the leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of
the amount of charge.

Try to understand why material bodies acquire charge. You know that
all matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules. Although normally the
materials are electrically neutral,  they do contain charges; but their charges
are exactly balanced. Forces that hold the molecules together, forces that
hold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive force of glue, forces associated
with surface tension, all are basically electrical in nature, arising from the
forces between charged particles. Thus the electric force is all pervasive and
it encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It is
therefore essential that we learn more about such a force.

To electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of
charge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this
excess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, being
less tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred
from one body to the other.  A body can thus be charged positively by
losing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively
by gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the
electrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets
positively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is
created in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are
transferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the
material body.

1.3  CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS

Some substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, others
do not.  Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily are
called conductors. They have electric charges (electrons) that are
comparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal
bodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass,
porcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of
electricity through them. They are called insulators. Most  substances
fall into one of the two classes stated above*.

When some charge is transferred to a conductor, it readily gets
distributed over the entire surface of the conductor. In contrast, if some
charge is put on an insulator, it stays at the same place. You will learn
why this happens in the next chapter.

This property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb
gets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article

* There is a third category called semiconductors, which offer resistance to the
movement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and
insulators.

like spoon does not. The charges on metal leak through
our body to the ground as both are conductors of
electricity. However, if a metal rod with a wooden or plastic
handle is rubbed without touching its metal part, it shows
signs of charging.

1.4  BASIC PROPERTIES OF ELECTRIC

CHARGE

We have seen that there are two types of charges, namely
positive and negative and their effects tend to cancel each
other. Here,  we shall now describe some other properties
of the electric charge.

If the sizes of charged bodies are very small as
compared to the distances between them, we treat them
as point charges. All the charge content of the body is
assumed to be concentrated at one point in space.

1.4.1  Additivity of charges

The gold leaf electroscope, (b) charge; we shall follow it up in the next section. We shall

electroscope. a system contains two point charges q1 and q2, the total

charge of the system is obtained simply by adding
algebraically q1 and q2 , i.e., charges add up like real numbers or they

  

are scalars like the mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q1,
q2, q3, …, qn, then the total charge of the system is q1 + q2 + q3 + … + qn
.  Charge has  magnitude but no direction, similar to mass. However,
there is one difference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is
always positive whereas a charge can be either positive or negative.
Proper signs have to be used while adding the charges in a system. For
example, the total charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, –3,
+4 and –5, in some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (–3) + (+4) + (–5) = –1 in
the same unit.

1.4.2  Charge is conserved

We have already  hinted to the fact that when bodies are charged by
rubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new
charges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric
charge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When
we rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses.
Within an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to
interactions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is
found that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved.
Conservation of charge has been established experimentally.

It is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated
system although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyed

in a process. Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns
into a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus created have
equal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after
the creation.

1.4.3  Quantisation of charge
Experimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples
of a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is always
given by

q = ne
where n is any integer, positive or negative. This basic unit of charge is
the charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge
on an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is
written as –e and that on a proton as +e.

The fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e is termed
as quantisation of charge. There are a large number of situations in physics
where certain physical quantities are quantised. The quantisation of charge
was first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by
English experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by
Millikan in 1912.

In the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a
coulomb and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms
the unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a
subsequent chapter. In terms of this definition, one coulomb is the charge
flowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 1
of Class XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the
basic unit of charge is

e = 1.602192 × 10–19 C
Thus, there are about 6 × 1018 electrons in a charge of  –1C. In

electrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom encountered
and hence we use smaller units 1 mC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC
(milli coulomb) = 10–3 C.

If the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the
universe, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e.
Thus, if a body contains n1 electrons and n2 protons, the total amount
of charge on the body is n2 × e + n1 × (–e) = (n2 – n1) e. Since n1 and n2
are integers, their difference is also an integer. Thus the charge on any
body is always an integral multiple of e and can be increased or
decreased also in steps of e.

The step size e is, however, very small because at the macroscopic
level, we deal with charges of a few mC. At this scale the fact that charge of
a body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. In this respect,
the grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.

This situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points
and lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to
us but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to

5

Physics
each other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many
small charges taken together appear as a continuous charge distribution.

At the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous
compared to the magnitude of charge e. Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a charge
of magnituOde, say 1 mC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic
charge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in
units of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous
values. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no
practical consequence and can be ignored. However, at the microscopic
level, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds
of e, i.e., they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and
quantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale
involved that is very important.

Example 1.1 If 109 electrons move out of a body to another body
every second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C
on the other body?
Solution In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Therefore
the charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C.
The time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated
to be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10–10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365  × 24 ×
3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb,
from a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will
need approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large
unit for many practical purposes.
It is, however, also important to know what is roughly the number of
electrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material.
A cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 1024

electrons.

Example 1.2 How much positive and negative charge is there in a
cup of water?
Solution Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is
250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole
(= 6.02 × 1023 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of
molecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 1023.
Each molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen
atom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and
total negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to
(250/18) × 6.02 × 1023 × 10 × 1.6 × 10–19 C = 1.34 × 107 C.

1.5  COULOMB’S LAW

Coulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two
point charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller
than the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the
charged bodies are treated as point charges. Coulomb measured the
force between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as
the square of the distance between the charges and was directly

6 proportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and

point charges q1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum,
the magnitude of the force (F) between them is given by

How did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments?
Coulomb used a torsion balance*  for measuring the force
between two charged metallic spheres. When the separation
between two spheres is much larger than the radius of each
sphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges.
However, the charges on the spheres were unknown, to begin
with. How then could he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)?
Coulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the Charles Augustin de

charge on a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact Coulomb (1736 – 1806)

be q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get charges q/2, q/4, engineer in the West
etc. Coulomb varied the distance for a fixed pair of charges and Indies. In 1776, he
measured the force for different separations. He then varied the returned to Paris and

Coulomb’s law in the vector notation. Let the position
vectors of charges q1 and q2 be r1 and r2 respectively

charges q1 and q2 have been numbered 1 and 2 for
convenience and the vector leading from 1 to 2 is

denoted by r21:

r21 = r2 – r1

In the same way, the vector leading from 2 to 1 is denoted by r12:

r12 = r1 – r2 = – r21

The magnitude of the vectors r21 and r12 is denoted by r21 and r12,
respectively (r12 = r21). The direction of a vector is specified by a unit
vector along the vector. To denote the direction from 1 to 2 (or from 2 to

negative), F21 is along r̂ 21, which denotes repulsion, as it should be for
like charges. If q1 and q2 are of opposite signs, F21 is along – rɵ 21(= rɵ 12),
which denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges. Thus, we do
not have to write separate equations for the cases of like and unlike
charges. Equation (1.3) takes care of both cases correctly [Fig. 1.3(b)].

Thus, Coulomb’s law agrees with the Newton’s third law.
· Coulomb’s law [Eq. (1.3)] gives the force between two charges q1 and

q2 in vacuum. If the charges are placed in matter or the intervening
space has matter, the situation gets complicated due to the presence
of charged constituents of matter. We shall consider electrostatics in
matter in the next chapter.

Example 1.3 Coulomb’s law for electrostatic force between two point
charges and Newton’s law for gravitational force between two stationary
point masses, both have inverse-square dependence on the distance
between the charges and masses respectively. (a) Compare the strength
of these forces by determining the ratio of their magnitudes (i) for an
electron and a proton and (ii) for two protons. (b) Estimate the
accelerations of electron and proton due to the electrical force of their

However, it may be mentioned here that the signs of the two forces

in nature and the Coulomb force is repulsive. The actual values
of these forces between two protons inside a nucleus (distance
between two protons is ~ 10-15 m inside a nucleus) are Fe ~ 230 N,
whereas, FG ~ 1.9 × 10–34 N.
The (dimensionless) ratio of the two forces shows that electrical
forces are enormously stronger than the gravitational forces.

Comparing this with the value of acceleration due to gravity, we
can conclude that the effect of gravitational field is negligible on
the motion of electron and it undergoes very large accelerations
under the action of Coulomb force due to a proton.
The value for acceleration of the proton is

centres is 10 cm, as shown in Fig. 1.4(a). The resulting repulsion of A
is noted (for example, by shining a beam of light and measuring the
deflection of its shadow on a screen). Spheres A and B are touched
by uncharged spheres C and D respectively, as shown in Fig. 1.4(b).
C and D are then removed and B is brought closer to A to a
distance of 5.0 cm between their centres, as shown in Fig. 1.4(c).
What is the expected repulsion of A on the basis of Coulomb’s law?
Spheres A and C and spheres B and D have identical sizes. Ignore
the sizes of A and B in comparison to the separation between their
centres.
Solution Let the original charge on sphere A be q and that on B be
q¢. At a distance r between their centres, the magnitude of the
electrostatic force on each is given by

neglecting the sizes of spheres A and B in comparison to r. When an
identical but uncharged sphere C touches A, the charges redistribute
on A and C and, by symmetry, each sphere carries a charge q/2.
Similarly, after D touches B, the redistributed charge on each is
q¢/2. Now, if the separation between A and B is halved, the magnitude
of the electrostatic force on each is

1.6  FORCES BETWEEN MULTIPLE CHARGES

The mutual electric force between two charges is given by
Coulomb’s law. How to calculate the force on a charge where
there are not one but several charges around? Consider a
system of n stationary charges q1, q2, q3, ..., q  in vacuum.

n
What is the force on q1 due to q2, q3, ..., q ? Coulomb’s law is

n
not enough to answer this question.  Recall that forces of
mechanical origin add according to the parallelogram law of
addition. Is the same true for forces of electrostatic origin?

Experimentally, it is verified that force on any charge due
to a number of other charges is the vector sum of all the forces
on that charge due to the other charges, taken one at a time.
The individual forces are unaffected due to the presence of
other charges. This is termed as the principle of superposition.

To better understand the concept, consider a system of
three charges q1, q2 and q3, as shown in Fig. 1.5(a). The force
on one charge, say q1, due to two other charges q2, q3 can
therefore be obtained by performing a vector addition of the
forces due to each one of these charges. Thus, if the force on q1
due to q2 is denoted by F12, F12 is given by Eq. (1.3)  even
though other charges are present.

The above calculation of force can be generalised to a system of

The principle of superposition says that in a system of charges q1,
q2, ..., q , the force on q1 due to q2 is the same as given by Coulomb’s law,

n
i.e., it is unaffected by the presence of the other charges q3, q4, ..., q . The

total force F1 on the charge q1, due to all other charges, is then given by
the vector sum of the forces F12, F13, ...,  F1 :

Similarly the total force on charge –q at C is F3  = 3  F n̂ , where n̂ is
the unit vector along the direction bisecting the ÐBCA.
It is interesting to see that the sum of the forces on the three charges
is zero, i.e.,
F1 + F2 + F3 = 0
The result is not at all surprising. It follows straight from the fact
that Coulomb’s law is consistent with Newton’s third law. The proof
is left to you as an exercise.

1.7  ELECTRIC FIELD

Let us consider a point charge Q placed in vacuum, at the origin O. If we
place another point charge q at a point P, where OP = r, then the charge Q
will exert a force on q as per Coulomb’s law. We may ask the question: If
charge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there
nothing? If there is nothing at the point P, then how does a force act
when we place the charge q at P. In order to answer such questions, the
early scientists introduced the concept of field. According to this, we say
that the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding.
When another charge q is brought at some point P, the field there acts on
it and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge Q  at a
point r is given as

E (r) 1 Q 1 Q
= rˆ = rˆ

4π 2 2
ε0 r 4π (1.6)

ε0 r

where rˆ =  r/r, is a unit vector from the origin to the point r. Thus, Eq.(1.6)
specifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position
vector r. The word “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (which
could be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge
has been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. We obtain the
force F exerted by a charge Q on a charge q, as

  

1 Qq
F = rˆ

4π 2 (1.7)
ε0 r

Note that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on the
charge Q. The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can be
looked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field of
Q and vice versa. If we denote the position of charge q by the vector r, it
experiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electric
field E at the location of q. Thus,

F(r) = q E(r) (1.8)
Equation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C*.
Some important remarks may be made here:

(i) From Eq. (1.8), we can infer that if q is unity, the electric field due to
FIGURE 1.8 Electric a charge Q is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the

field (a) due to a electric field due to a charge Q at a point in space may be defined
charge Q, (b) due to a as the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed

charge –Q.

at that point. The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is
called a source charge and the charge q, which tests the effect of a
source charge, is called a test charge. Note that the source charge Q
must remain at its original location. However, if a charge q is brought
at any point around Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical
force due to q and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to
make q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but the
ratio F/q is finite and defines the electric field:


E = F 

lim (1 9
q→0 

. )
q 

A practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbed
in the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces!
This may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice.
When we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to a
charged planar sheet (Section 1.14), the charges on the sheet are held to
their locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents
inside the sheet.
(ii) Note that the electric field E due to Q, though defined operationally in

terms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is because
F is proportional to q, so the ratio F/q does not depend on q. The
force F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular
location of charge q which may take any value in the space around
the charge Q. Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent on
the space coordinate r. For different positions of the charge q all over
the space, we get different values of electric field E. The field exists at
every point in three-dimensional space.

(iii) For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially
outwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is
negative, the electric field vector, at each point, points radially inwards.

(iv) Since the magnitude of the force F on charge q due to charge Q
depends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q,
the magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on the
distance r. Thus at equal distances from the charge Q, the magnitude
of its electric field E is same. The magnitude of electric field E due to
a point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its
centre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.

Consider a system of charges q1, q2, ..., q  with  position vectors r1,n

r2, ..., r  relative  to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point in

system of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit
test charge placed at that point, without disturbing the original
positions of charges q1, q2, ..., q . We can use Coulomb’s law and the

1.7.2  Physical significance of electric field
You may wonder why the notion of electric field has been introduced
here at all. After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity
is the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s
law and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this
intermediate quantity called the electric field?

For electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not
really necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the
electrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in
the space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive
test charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing
the system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and
is independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine
the field. The term field in physics generally refers to a quantity that is
defined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric
field is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.

The true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however,
emerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-
dependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force
between two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatest
speed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another

16 is c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q1 on q2 cannot

Reprint 2025-26



Electric Charges
and Fields

arise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect
(force on q2) and the cause (motion of q1). It is precisely here that the
notion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very
useful. The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q1
produces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed
c, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of field elegantly accounts
for the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be
detected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as
physical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an
independent dynamics of their own,  i.e., they evolve according to laws
of their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-
dependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time
and then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields
transporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday
and is now among the central concepts in physics.

Example 1.7 An electron falls through a distance of 1.5 cm in a
uniform electric field of magnitude 2.0 × 104 N C–1 [Fig. 1.10(a)]. The
direction of the field is reversed keeping its magnitude unchanged
and a proton falls through the same distance [Fig. 1.10(b)]. Compute
the time of fall in each case. Contrast the situation with that of ‘free
fall under gravity’.

Thus, the heavier particle (proton) takes a greater time to fall through
the same distance. This is in basic contrast to the situation of ‘free
fall under gravity’ where the time of fall is independent of the mass of
the body. Note that in this example we have ignored the acceleration
due to gravity in calculating the time of fall. To see if this is justified,
let us calculate the acceleration of the proton in the given electric
field:

which is enormous compared to the value of g (9.8 m s–2), the
acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration of the electron is even
greater. Thus, the effect of acceleration due to gravity can be ignored
in this example.

1.8  ELECTRIC FIELD LINES

We have studied electric field in the last section. It is a vector quantity
and can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent E
due to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at the
origin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the
electric field with their lengths proportional to the strength
of the field at each point. Since the magnitude of electric
field at a point decreases inversely as the square of the
distance of that point from the charge, the vector gets
shorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing
radially outward. Figure 1.12 shows such a picture.  In
this figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the
force acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of
that arrow.  Connect the arrows pointing in one direction
and the resulting figure represents a field line. We thus
get many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point
charge. Have we lost the information about the strength
or magnitude of the field now, because it was contained
in the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the
field is represented by the density of field lines. E is strong
near the charge, so the density of field lines is more near
the charge and the lines are closer. Away from the charge, FIGURE 1.12 Field of a point charge.
the field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less,
resulting in well-separated lines.

Another person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not
important. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region. 19

Reprint 2025-26

 EXAMPLE 1.8



Physics
It is the relative density of lines in different regions which is
important.

We draw the figure on the plane of paper, i.e., in two-
dimensions but we live in three-dimensions. So if one wishes
to estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the
number of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular
to the lines.  Since the electric field decreases as the square of
the distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the
charge increases as the square of the distance, the number
of field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant,
whatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.

We started by saying that the field lines carry information
about the direction of electric field at different points in space.

FIGURE 1.13  Dependence of
electric field strength on the Having drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density

distance and its relation to the (i.e., closeness) of the field lines at different points indicates
number of field lines. the relative strength of electric field at those points. The field

lines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart
where it is weak. Figure 1.13 shows a set of field lines. We

can imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and
S normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture
cutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at
these points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.

To understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather
the solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the
area with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions.
Recall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small
transverse line element Dl be placed at a distance r from a point O. Then
the angle subtended by Dl  at O can be approximated as Dq = Dl/r.
Likewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle* subtended by a small
perpendicular plane area DS, at a distance r, can be written as
DW = DS/r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial
field lines is the same. In Fig. 1.13, for two points P1 and P2 at distances
r1 and r2 from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle
DW is r 2

1 DW at P1 and an element of area r 2
2 DW at P2, respectively. The

number of lines (say n) cutting these area elements are the same. The
number of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n/(r 2

1 DW) at
P1 and n/(r 2

2 DW) at P2, respectively. Since n and DW are common, the
strength of the field clearly has a 1/r 2 dependence.

The picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an
intuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric fields around
charged configurations. Faraday called them lines of force. This term is
somewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The more
appropriate term is field lines (electric or magnetic) that we have
adopted in this book.

Electric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric
field around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,

a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent to it at each
point is in the direction of the net field at that point. An
arrow on the curve is obviously necessary to specify the
direction of electric field from the two possible directions
indicated by a tangent to the curve. A field line is a space
curve, i.e., a curve in three dimensions.

Figure 1.14 shows the field lines around some simple
charge configurations. As mentioned earlier, the field lines
are in 3-dimensional space, though the figure shows them
only in a plane. The field lines of a single positive charge
are radially outward while those of a single negative
charge are radially inward. The field lines around a system
of two positive charges (q, q) give a vivid pictorial
description of their mutual repulsion, while those around
the configuration of two equal and opposite charges
(q, –q), a dipole, show clearly the mutual attraction
between the charges. The field lines follow some important
general properties:
(i) Field lines start from positive charges and end at

negative charges. If there is a single charge, they may
start or end at infinity.

(ii) In a charge-free region, electric field lines can be taken
to be continuous curves without any breaks.

(iii) Two field lines can never cross each other. (If they did,
the field at the point of intersection will not have a
unique direction, which is absurd.)

(iv) Electrostatic field lines do not form any closed loops.
This follows from the conservative nature of electric
field (Chapter 2).

1.9  ELECTRIC FLUX

Consider flow of a liquid with velocity v, through a small
flat surface dS, in a direction normal to the surface. The
rate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the
area per unit time  v dS and represents the flux of liquid
flowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface is
not parallel to the direction of flow of liquid, i.e., to v, but
makes an angle q with it, the projected area in a plane
perpendicular to v is δ dS cos q. Therefore, the flux going
out of the surface dS is v. n̂ dS. For the case of  the electric
field, we define an analogous quantity and call it electric
flux. We should, however, note that there is no flow of a
physically observable quantity unlike the case of
liquid flow.

In the picture of electric field lines described above, FIGURE 1.14 Field lines due to

placed normal to the field at a point is a measure of the
strength of electric field at that point. This means that if 21

Physics
we place a small planar element of area DS
normal to E at a point, the number of field lines
crossing it is proportional* to E DS. Now
suppose we tilt the area element by angle q.
Clearly, the number of field lines crossing the
area element will be smaller. The projection of
the area element normal to E is DS cosq. Thus,
the number of field lines crossing DS is
proportional to E DS cosq. When q = 90°, field
lines will be parallel to DS and will not cross it
at all (Fig. 1.15).

The orientation of area element and not
merely its magnitude is important in many
contexts. For example, in a stream, the amount
of water flowing through a ring will naturally
depend on how you hold the ring. If you hold
it normal to the flow, maximum water will flow

FIGURE 1.15 Dependence of flux on the
inclination q between E and n̂ . through it than if you hold it with some other

orientation. This shows that an area element
should be treated as a vector. It has a

magnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar
area? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the
plane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.

How to associate a vector to the area of a curved surface? We imagine
dividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements.
Each small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated
with it, as explained before.

Notice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along
its normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do
we choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element?
This problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given
context. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple.
The vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken
to be in the direction of the outward normal. This is the convention used
in Fig. 1.16. Thus, the area element vector DS at a point on a closed
surface equals DS n̂  where DS is the magnitude of the area element and
n̂  is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point.

We now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux Df through
an area element DS is defined by

Df = E.DS = E DS  cosq (1.11)
which, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting
the area element. The angle q here is the angle between E and DS. For a
closed surface, with the convention stated already, q is the angle between

FIGURE 1.16 E and the outward normal   to the area element. Notice we could look at
Convention for the expression E DS cosq  in two ways:  E (DS cosq ) i.e., E times the
defining normal

n̂  and DS. * It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to EDS. The
number of field lines is after all, a matter of how many field lines we choose to
draw. What is physically significant is the relative number of field lines crossing

22 a given area at different points.

projection of area normal to E,  or E  DS, i.e., component of E along the
^

normal to the area element times the magnitude of the area element. The
unit of electric flux is N C–1 m2.

The basic definition of electric flux given by Eq. (1.11) can be used, in
principle, to calculate the total flux through any given surface. All we
have to do is to divide the surface into small area elements, calculate the
flux at each element and add them up. Thus, the total flux f through a
surface S is

f ~ S E.DS (1.12)
The approximation sign is put because the electric field E is taken to

be constant over the small area element. This is mathematically exact
only when you take the limit DS ® 0  and the sum in Eq. (1.12) is written
as an integral.

1.10  ELECTRIC DIPOLE

An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite point charges q and –q,
separated by a distance 2a. The line connecting the two charges defines
a direction in space. By convention, the direction from –q to q is said to
be the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of –q and q is
called the centre of the dipole.

The total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not
mean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge q and
–q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when
added, do not exactly cancel out. However, at distances much larger than
the separation of the two charges forming a dipole (r >> 2a), the fields
due to q and –q nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole
therefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1/r 2 (the dependence
on r of the field due to a single charge q). These qualitative ideas are
borne out by the explicit calculation as follows:

1.10.1  The field of an electric dipole
The electric field of the pair of charges (–q and q) at any point in space
can be found out from Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.
The results are simple for the following two cases: (i) when the point is on
the dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the equatorial plane of the dipole,
i.e.,  on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its centre.  The
electric field at any general point P is obtained by adding the electric
fields E  due to the charge –q and E+  due to the charge q, by the

–q q
parallelogram law of vectors.

From Eqs. (1.15) and (1.18), it is clear that the dipole field at large
distances does not involve q and a separately; it depends on the product
qa. This suggests the definition of dipole moment. The dipole moment
vector p of an electric dipole is defined by

p  = q × 2a p̂ (1.19)
that is, it is a vector whose magnitude is charge q times the separation
2a (between the pair of charges q, –q) and the direction is along the line
from –q to q. In terms of p, the electric field of a dipole at large distances

 Notice the important point that the dipole field at large distances
falls off not as 1/r2 but as1/r3. Further,  the magnitude and the direction
of the dipole field depends not only on the distance r but also on the
angle between the position vector r and the dipole moment p.

We can think of the limit when the dipole size 2a approaches zero,
the charge q approaches infinity in such a way that the product
p = q × 2a is finite. Such a dipole is referred to as a point dipole. For a
point dipole, Eqs. (1.20) and (1.21) are exact, true for any r.

1.10.2  Physical significance of dipoles
In most molecules, the centres of positive charges and of negative charges*
lie at the same place. Therefore, their dipole moment is zero. CO2 and
CH4 are of this type of molecules. However, they develop a dipole moment
when an electric field is applied. But in some molecules, the centres of
negative charges and of positive charges do not coincide. Therefore they
have a permanent electric dipole moment, even in the absence of an electric
field. Such molecules are called polar molecules. Water molecules, H2O,
is an example of this type. Various materials give rise to interesting
properties and important applications in the presence or  absence of
electric field.

the electric field at (a) a point P on the axis of the dipole 15 cm away
from its centre O on the side of the positive charge, as shown in Fig.

O and normal to the axis of the dipole, as shown in Fig. 1.18(b).

In this example, the ratio OP/OB is quite large (= 60). Thus, we can

1.11  DIPOLE IN A UNIFORM EXTERNAL FIELD

Consider a permanent dipole of dipole moment p in a uniform
external field E, as shown in Fig. 1.19. (By permanent dipole, we
mean that p exists  irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E.)

There is a force qE on q and a force –qE on –q. The net force on
the dipole is zero, since E is uniform. However, the charges are
separated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque
on the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is
independent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of FIGURE 1.19 Dipole in a
each force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular uniform electric field.
distance between the two antiparallel forces).

Magnitude of torque = q E × 2 a sinq
       = 2 q a E sinq

Its direction is normal to the plane of the paper, coming out of it.
The magnitude of p × E is also p E sinq and its direction

is normal to the paper, coming out of it. Thus,
t  = p × E (1.22)
This torque will tend to align the dipole with the field

E. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.
What happens if the field is not uniform? In that case,

the net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there
will, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The
general case is involved, so let us consider the simpler
situations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In
either case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force
on the dipole if E is not uniform.

Figure 1.20 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that
when p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the
direction of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,
the net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing
field. In general, the force depends on the orientation of p
with respect to E.

This brings us to a common observation in frictional
electricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of FIGURE 1.20 Electric force on a
paper. The comb, as we know, acquires charge through dipole: (a) E parallel to p, (b)  E

discussion, the charged comb ‘polarises’ the piece of paper, i.e., induces
a net dipole moment in the direction of field. Further, the electric field
due to the comb is not uniform. This non-uniformity of the field makes a
dipole to experience a net force on it. In this situation, it is easily seen
that the paper should move in the direction of the comb!

1.12  CONTINUOUS CHARGE DISTRIBUTION

We have so far dealt with charge configurations involving discrete charges
q1, q2, ..., q . One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the

n
mathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For
many purposes, however, it is impractical to work in terms of discrete
charges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For
example, on the surface of a charged conductor, it is impractical to specify
the charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged
constituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element DS (Fig. 1.21)
on the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic
scale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and
specify the charge DQ on that element. We then define a surface charge
density s at the area element by

σ = ∆Q

∆ (1.23)
S

We can do this at different points on the conductor and thus arrive at
a continuous function s, called the surface charge density. The surface
charge density s  so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the
discontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level*. s  represents
macroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out
average of the microscopic charge density over an area element DS which,
as said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The
units for s are C/m2.

the density of a liquid, we are referring to its macroscopic density. We
regard it as a continuous fluid and ignore its discrete molecular
constitution.

The field due to a continuous charge distribution can be obtained in
much the same way as for a system of discrete charges, Eq. (1.10). Suppose
a continuous charge distribution in space has a charge density r. Choose
any convenient origin O and let the position vector of any point in the
charge distribution be r. The charge density r may vary from point to
point, i.e., it is a function of r. Divide the charge distribution into small
volume elements of size DV. The charge in a volume element DV is rDV.

Now, consider any general point P (inside or outside the distribution)
with position vector R (Fig. 1.21). Electric field due to the charge rDV is
given by Coulomb’s law:

1 ρ ∆V
∆E = rˆ'

4πε 2 (1.26)
0 r'

where r¢ is the distance between the charge element and P, and  r̂ ¢ is a
unit vector in the direction from the charge element to P. By the
superposition principle, the total electric field due to the charge
distribution is obtained by summing over electric fields due to different
volume elements:

1 ρ ∆V
E ≅ Σ rˆ'

4πε ∆ 2 (1.27)
all V

0 r'
Note that r, r¢,  rˆ ′  all can vary from point to point. In a strict

mathematical method, we should let DV®0 and the sum then becomes
an integral; but we omit that discussion here, for simplicity. In short,
using Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle, electric field can
be determined for any charge distribution, discrete or continuous or part
discrete and part continuous.

1.13  GAUSS’S LAW

As a simple application of the notion of electric flux, let us consider the
total flux through a sphere of radius r, which encloses a point charge q
at its centre. Divide the sphere into small area elements, as shown in
Fig. 1.22.

The flux through an area element DS is

φ q
∆ = Ei∆ S = rˆi ∆S

4πε 2 (1.28)

where we have used Coulomb’s law for the electric field due to a single
charge q. The unit vector r̂  is along the radius vector from the centre to
the area element. Now, since the normal to a sphere at every point is
along the radius vector at that point, the area element DS and r̂   have
the same direction. Therefore,

Equation (1.30) is a simple illustration of a general result of
electrostatics called Gauss’s law.

We state Gauss’s law without proof:
Electric flux through a closed surface S

= q/e0 (1.31)
q = total charge enclosed by S.
The law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface is

zero if no charge is enclosed by the surface. We can see that explicitly in
the simple situation of Fig. 1.23.

Here the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed
cylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E. The total
flux f  through the surface is  f = f1 + f2 + f3, where f1 and f2 represent
the flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the
cylinder and f3 is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the
closed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is
perpendicular to E, so by definition of flux, f3 = 0. Further, the outward
normal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.
Therefore,

f1 = –E S1,     f2 = +E S2

S1 = S2 = S
where S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,
as expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric
flux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge
contained in the closed surface is zero.

The great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in
general, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let
us note some important points regarding this law:
(i) Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape

or size.
(ii) The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1.31), includes the

sum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located
anywhere inside the surface.

(iii) In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some
charges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears
on the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and
outside S. The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however,

30 represents only the total charge inside S.

(iv) The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss’s law is called
the Gaussian surface. You may choose any Gaussian surface and
apply Gauss’s law. However, take care not to let the Gaussian surface
pass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due
to a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of
any charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without
any bound.) However, the Gaussian surface can pass through a

(v) Gauss’s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the
electrostatic field when the system has some symmetry. This is

(vi) Finally, Gauss’s law is based on the inverse square dependence on

law will indicate departure from the inverse square law.

1.14  APPLICATIONS OF GAUSS’S LAW

The electric field due to a general charge distribution is, as seen above,
given by Eq. (1.27). In practice, except for some special cases, the
summation (or integration) involved in this equation cannot be carried
out to give electric field at every point in
space. For some symmetric charge
configurations, however, it is possible to
obtain the electric field in a simple way using
the Gauss’s law. This is best understood by
some examples.

1.14.1 Field due to an infinitely
long straight uniformly
charged wire

Consider an infinitely long thin straight wire
with uniform linear charge density l. The wire
is obviously an axis of symmetry. Suppose we
take the radial vector from O to P and rotate it
around the wire. The points P, P¢, P¢¢ so
obtained are completely equivalent with
respect to the charged wire. This implies that
the electric field must have the same magnitude
at these points. The direction of electric field at
every point must be radial (outward if l > 0,
inward if l < 0). This is clear from Fig. 1.26.

Consider a pair of line elements P1 and P2
of the wire, as shown. The electric fields
produced by the two elements of the pair when
summed give a resultant electric field which
is radial (the components normal to the radial
vector cancel). This is true for any such pair
and hence the total field at any point P is
radial. Finally, since the wire is infinite,
electric field does not depend on the position
of P along the length of the wire. In short, the
electric field is everywhere radial in the plane
cutting the wire normally, and its magnitude
depends only on the radial distance r.

To calculate the field, imagine a cylindrical
Gaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. 1.26(b).
Since the field is everywhere radial, flux
through the two ends of the cylindrical
Gaussian surface is zero. At the cylindrical

of the cylinder. 33

where n̂  is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing
through the point. E is directed outward if l is positive and inward if l is
negative.

Note that when we write a vector A as a scalar multiplied by a unit
vector, i.e., as A = A â , the scalar A is  an algebraic number. It can be
negative or positive. The direction of A will be the same as that of the unit
vector â if A > 0 and opposite to â  if A < 0. When we want to restrict to
non-negative values, we use the symbol A and call it the modulus of A .
Thus, A ≥ 0 .

Also note that though only  the charge enclosed by the surface (ll )
was included above, the electric field E is due to the charge on the entire
wire. Further, the assumption that the wire is infinitely long is crucial.
Without this assumption, we cannot take E to be normal to the curved
part of the cylindrical Gaussian surface. However, Eq. (1.32) is
approximately true for electric field around the central portions of a long
wire, where the end effects may be ignored.

1.14.2  Field due to a uniformly charged infinite plane sheet
Let s be the uniform surface charge density of an infinite plane sheet
(Fig. 1.27). We take the x-axis normal to the given plane. By symmetry,
the electric field will not depend on y and z coordinates and its direction

at every point must be parallel to the x-direction.
We can take the Gaussian surface to be a

rectangular parallelepiped of cross-sectional area
A, as shown. (A cylindrical surface will also do.) As
seen from the figure, only the two faces 1 and 2 will
contribute to the flux; electric field lines are parallel
to the other faces and they, therefore, do not
contribute to the total flux.

The unit vector normal to surface 1 is in –x
direction while  the unit  vector normal to surface 2
is in the +x direction. Therefore, flux  E.DS through
both the surfaces are equal and add up. Therefore

where n̂  is a unit vector normal to the plane and going away from it.
E is directed away from the plate if s  is positive and toward the plate

if s is negative. Note that the above application of the Gauss’ law has
brought out an additional fact: E is independent of x also.

For a finite large planar sheet, Eq. (1.33) is approximately true in the
middle regions of the planar sheet, away from the ends.

1.14.3  Field due to a uniformly charged thin spherical shell
Let s be the uniform surface charge density of a thin spherical shell of
radius R (Fig. 1.28). The situation has obvious spherical symmetry. The
field at any point P, outside or inside, can depend only on r (the radial
distance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e.,
along the radius vector).
(i) Field outside the shell: Consider a point P outside the

shell with radius vector r. To calculate E at P, we take the
Gaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with centre
O, passing through P. All points on this sphere are equivalent
relative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we
mean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each point
of the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude
E and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E and
DS at every point are parallel and the flux through each
element is E DS. Summing over all DS, the flux through the
Gaussian surface is E × 4 p r 2. The charge enclosed is
s × 4 p R 2. By Gauss’s law

q < 0. This, however, is exactly the field produced by a charge
q placed at the centre O. Thus for points outside the shell, the field due
to a uniformly charged shell is as if  the entire charge of the shell is
concentrated at its centre.
(ii) Field inside the shell: In Fig. 1.28(b), the point P is inside the

shell. The Gaussian surface is again a sphere through P centred at O. 35

Reprint 2025-26



Physics
The flux through the Gaussian surface, calculated as before, is
E × 4 p r2. However, in this case, the Gaussian surface encloses no
charge. Gauss’s law then gives
E × 4 p r2 =  0
i.e., E = 0          (r < R ) (1.35)

that is, the field due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all points
inside the shell*. This important result is a direct consequence of Gauss’s
law which follows from Coulomb’s law. The experimental verification of
this result confirms the 1/r2 dependence in Coulomb’s law.

Example 1.12 An early model for an atom considered it to have a
positively charged point nucleus of charge Ze, surrounded by a
uniform density of negative charge up to a radius R. The atom as a
whole is neutral. For this model, what is the electric field at a distance
r from the nucleus?

FIGURE 1.29

Solution  The charge distribution for this model of the atom is as
shown in Fig. 1.29. The total negative charge in the uniform spherical
charge distribution of radius R must be –Z e, since the atom (nucleus
of charge Z e + negative charge) is neutral. This immediately gives us
the negative charge density r, since we must have

To find the electric field E(r) at a point P which is a distance r away
from the nucleus, we use Gauss’s law. Because of the spherical
symmetry of the charge distribution, the magnitude of the electric
field E(r) depends only on the radial distance, no matter what the
direction of r. Its direction is along (or opposite to) the radius vector r
from the origin to the point P. The obvious Gaussian surface is a
spherical surface centred at the nucleus. We consider two situations,
namely, r < R and r > R.
(i) r < R : The electric flux f enclosed by the spherical surface is
    f  =  E (r ) × 4 p r2

where E (r )  is the magnitude of the electric field at r. This is because
the field at any point on the spherical Gaussian surface has the

E (r ) × 4 p  r 2 = 0  or  E (r ) = 0;    r > R
At r = R, both cases give the same result: E = 0.

SUMMARY

1. Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms,
molecules and bulk matter.

2. From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that
there are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel
and unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod
rubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is
then negative.

3. Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them,
insulators do not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in
electrolytes both positive and negative ions are mobile.

4. Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity
and conservation.
Quantisation of electric charge means that total charge (q) of a body
is always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge (e) i.e.,
q = n e, where n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... Proton and electron have charges
+e, –e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large
number, quantisation of charge can be ignored.
Additivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system
is the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs)
of all individual charges in the system.
Conservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an
isolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when

37

Physics

bodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge
from one body to another, but no creation or destruction
of charge.

5. Coulomb’s Law: The mutual electrostatic force between two point
charges q1 and q2 is proportional to the product q1q2 and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance r21 separating them.
Mathematically,

In SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb. The experimental value of
the constant e0 is

e0 = 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1 m–2

The approximate value of k is
k = 9 × 109 N m2 C–2

6. The ratio of electric force and gravitational force between a proton
and an electron is

7. Superposition Principle: The principle is based on the property that the
forces with which two charges attract or repel each other are not
affected by the presence of a third (or more) additional charge(s). For
an assembly of charges q1, q2, q3, ..., the force on any charge, say q1, is
the vector sum of the force on  q1 due to q2, the force on q1 due to q3,
and so on. For each pair, the force is given by the Coulomb’s law for
two charges stated earlier.

8. The electric field E at a point due to a charge configuration is the
force on a small positive test charge q placed at the point divided by
the magnitude of the charge. Electric field due to a point charge q has
a magnitude |q|/4pe0r

2; it is radially outwards from q, if q is positive,
and radially inwards if q is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric field
also satisfies superposition principle.

9. An electric field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent
at each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at that
point. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength
of electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions
of strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is
weak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformly
spaced parallel straight lines.

10. Some of the important properties of field lines are: (i) Field lines are
continuous curves without any breaks. (ii) Two field lines cannot cross
each other. (iii) Electrostatic field lines start at positive charges and
end at negative charges —they cannot form closed loops.

11. An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite charges q and –q
separated by some distance 2a. Its dipole moment vector p has
magnitude 2qa and is in the direction of the dipole axis from –q to q.

POINTS TO PONDER

1. You might wonder why the protons, all carrying positive charges,
are compactly residing inside the nucleus. Why do they not fly away?
You will learn that there is a third kind of a fundamental force,
called the strong force which holds them together. The range of
distance where this force is effective is, however, very small ~10-14

m. This is precisely the size of the nucleus. Also the electrons are
not allowed to sit on top of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus,
due to the laws of quantum mechanics. This gives the atoms their
structure as they exist in nature.

2. Coulomb force and gravitational force follow the same inverse-square
law. But gravitational force has only one sign (always attractive), while

40

Reprint 2025-26



Electric Charges
and Fields

Coulomb force can be of both signs (attractive and repulsive), allowing
possibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despite
being a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasive
force in nature.

3. The constant of proportionality k in Coulomb’s law is a matter of
choice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb’s law. In SI
units, however, what is defined is the unit of current (A) via its magnetic
effect (Ampere’s law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined
by (1C = 1 A s). In this case, the value of k is no longer arbitrary; it is
approximately 9 × 109 N m2 C–2.

4. The rather large value of k, i.e., the large size of the unit of charge
(1C) from the point of view of electric effects arises because (as
mentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms of
magnetic forces (forces on  current–carrying wires) which are generally
much weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unit
of reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit for
electric effects.

5. The additive property of charge is not an ‘obvious’ property. It is related
to the fact that electric charge has no direction associated with it;
charge is a scalar.

6. Charge is not only a scalar (or invariant) under rotation; it is also
invariant for frames of reference in relative motion. This is not always
true for every scalar. For example, kinetic energy is a scalar under
rotation, but is not invariant for frames of reference in relative
motion.

7. Conservation of total charge of an isolated system is a property
independent of the scalar nature of charge noted in point 6.
Conservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference.
A quantity may be scalar but not conserved (like kinetic energy in an
inelastic collision). On the other hand, one can have conserved vector
quantity (e.g., angular momentum of an isolated system).

8. Quantisation of electric charge is a basic (unexplained) law of nature;
interestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass.

9. Superposition principle should not be regarded as ‘obvious’, or
equated with the law of addition of vectors. It says two things:
force on one charge due to another charge is unaffected by the
presence of other charges, and there are no additional three-body,
four-body, etc., forces which arise only when there are more than
two charges.

10. The electric field due to a discrete charge configuration is not defined
at the locations of the discrete charges. For continuous volume
charge distribution, it is defined at any point in the distribution.
For a surface charge distribution, electric field is discontinuous
across the surface.

11. The electric field due to a charge configuration with total charge zero
is not zero; but for distances large compared to the size of
the configuration, its field falls off faster than 1/r 2, typical of field
due to a single charge. An electric dipole is the simplest example of
this fact.

ELECTROSTATIC
POTENTIAL AND
CAPACITANCE

2.1  INTRODUCTION

In Chapters 5 and 7 (Class XI), the notion of potential energy was
introduced. When an external force does work in taking a body from a
point to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force,
that work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the external
force is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing
an equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic and
potential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are called
conservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples of
conservative forces.

Coulomb force between two (stationary) charges is also a conservative
force. This is not surprising, since both have inverse-square dependence
on distance and differ mainly in the proportionality constants – the
masses in the gravitational law are replaced by charges in Coulomb’s
law. Thus, like the potential energy of a mass in a gravitational
field, we can define electrostatic potential energy of a charge in an
electrostatic field.

Consider an electrostatic field E due to some charge configuration.
First, for simplicity, consider the field E due to a charge Q placed at the
origin. Now, imagine that we bring a test charge q from a point R to a
point P against the repulsive force on it due to the charge Q. With reference

to Fig. 2.1, this will happen if Q and q are both positive
or both negative. For definiteness, let us take Q, q > 0.

Two remarks may be made here. First, we assume
that the test charge q is so small that it does not disturb
the original configuration, namely the charge Q at the
origin (or else, we keep Q fixed at the origin by some

FIGURE 2.1 A test charge q (> 0) is unspecified force). Second, in bringing the charge q from

force on it by the charge Q (> 0) This means there is no net force on or acceleration of
placed at the origin. the charge q when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is

brought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In
this situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work
done by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential
energy of the charge q. If the external force is removed on reaching P, the
electric force will take the charge away from Q – the stored energy (potential
energy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge q in such a
way that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved.

Thus, work done by external forces in moving a charge q from R to P is

W  =   
RP

        =    –  (2.1)

This work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored
as potential energy.

At every point in electric field, a particle with charge q possesses a
certain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potential
energy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between points
R and P.

Thus, potential energy difference

∆U = U P −UR = WRP (2.2)
(Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric

force and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e., –W .)
RP

Therefore, we can define electric potential energy difference between
two points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving
(without accelerating) charge q from one point to another for electric field
of any arbitrary charge configuration.

Two important comments may be made at this stage:
(i) The right side of Eq. (2.2) depends only on the initial and final positions

of the charge. It means that the work done by an electrostatic field in
moving a charge from one point to another depends only on the initial
and the final points and is independent of the path taken to go from
one point to the other. This is the fundamental characteristic of a
conservative force. The concept of the potential energy would not be
meaningful if the work depended on the path. The path-independence
of work done by an electrostatic field can be proved using the

46 Coulomb’s law. We omit this proof here.

(ii) Equation (2.2) defines potential energy difference in terms
of the physically meaningful quantity work. Clearly,
potential energy so defined is undetermined to within an
additive constant.What this means is that the actual value
of potential energy is not physically significant; it is only
the difference of potential energy that is significant. We can
always add an arbitrary constant a to potential energy at
every point, since this will not change the potential energy
difference:

(U P + α ) − (UR + α ) = UP − UR

Put it differently, there is a freedom in choosing the point
where potential energy is zero. A convenient choice is to have
electrostatic potential energy zero at infinity. With this choice,

Consider a point charge Q at the origin (Fig. 2.3). For definiteness, take Q

position vector r from the origin. For that we must
calculate the work done in bringing a unit positive
test charge from infinity to the point P. For Q > 0,
the work done against the repulsive force on the
test charge is positive. Since work done is
independent of the path, we choose a convenient
path – along the radial direction from infinity to
the point P.

At some intermediate point P¢ on the path, the
electrostatic force on a unit positive charge is

path can be resolved into two perpendicular displacements: One along
r and another perpendicular to r. The work done corresponding to

q and  –q separated by a (small) distance 2a. Its total charge is zero. It is
characterised by a dipole moment vector p whose magnitude is q × 2a
and which points in the direction from –q to q (Fig. 2.5). We also saw that

the field falls off, at large distance, not as
1/r 2 (typical of field due to a single charge)
but as 1/r3. We, now, determine the electric
potential due to a dipole and contrast it
with the potential due to a single charge.

As before, we take the origin at the
centre of the dipole. Now we know that the
electric field obeys the superposition
principle. Since potential is related to the
work done by the field, electrostatic
potential also follows the superposition
principle. Thus, the potential due to the
dipole is the sum of potentials due to the

(i) The potential due to a dipole depends not just on r but also on the

angle between the position vector  r and the dipole moment vector p.
(It is, however, axially symmetric about p. That is, if you rotate the
position vector r  about  p, keeping q fixed, the points corresponding
to P on the cone so generated will have the same potential as at P.)

such contributions, and thus determine the potential due to the entire

2.6  EQUIPOTENTIAL SURFACES

An equipotential surface is a surface with a constant value of potential
at all points on the surface. For a single charge q, the potential is given
by Eq. (2.8):

1 q
V =

4πεo r
This shows that V is a constant if r is constant. Thus, equipotential

surfaces of a single point charge are concentric spherical surfaces centred
at the charge.

Now the electric field lines for a single charge q are radial lines starting
from or ending at the charge, depending on whether q is positive or negative.
Clearly, the electric field at every point is normal to the equipotential surface
passing through that point. This is true in general: for any charge
configuration, equipotential surface through a point is normal to the
electric field at that point. The proof of this statement is simple.

If the field were not normal to the equipotential surface, it would
have non-zero component along the surface. To move a unit test charge
against the direction of the component of the field, work would have to
be done. But this is in contradiction to the definition of an equipotential

surface B. d l is the perpendicular distance of the
surface A from P. Imagine that a unit positive charge
is moved along this perpendicular from the surface B
to surface A against the electric field. The work done
in this process is |E|d l.

We thus arrive at two important conclusions concerning the relation

(ii) Its magnitude is given by the change in the magnitude of potential

per unit displacement normal to the equipotential surface at the point.

More generally, the potential energy expression,
Eq. (2.22), is unaltered whatever way the charges are brought to the specified
locations, because of path-independence of work for electrostatic force.

Equation (2.22) is true for any sign of  q and q . If q q > 0, potential
1 2 1 2 

energy is positive. This is as expected, since for like charges (q q > 0),
1 2 

electrostatic force is repulsive and a positive amount of work is needed to
be done against this force to bring the charges from infinity to a finite
distance apart. For unlike charges (q q < 0), the electrostatic force is

1 2 
attractive. In that case, a positive amount of work is needed against this
force to take the charges from the given location to infinity. In other words,
a negative amount of work is needed for the reverse path (from infinity to
the present locations), so the potential energy is negative.

Equation (2.22) is easily generalised for a system of any number of
point charges. Let us calculate the potential energy of a system of three
charges q , q and q  located at r , r , r , respectively. To bring q  first

2.8  POTENTIAL ENERGY IN AN EXTERNAL FIELD

2.8.1  Potential energy of a single charge
In Section 2.7, the source of the electric field was specified – the charges
and their locations - and the potential energy of the system of those charges
was  determined. In this section, we ask a related but a distinct question.
What is the potential energy of a charge q in a given field? This question
was, in fact, the starting point that led us to the notion of the electrostatic
potential (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). But here we address this question again
to clarify in what way it is different from the discussion in Section 2.7.

The main difference is that we are now concerned with the potential
energy of a charge (or charges) in an external field. The external field E is
not produced by the given charge(s) whose potential energy we wish to
calculate. E is produced by sources external to the given charge(s).The
external sources may be known, but often they are unknown or
unspecified; what is specified is the electric field E or the electrostatic
potential V due to the external sources. We assume that the charge q
does not significantly affect the sources producing the external field. This
is true if q is very small, or the external sources are held fixed by other
unspecified forces. Even if q is finite, its influence on the external sources
may still be ignored in the situation when very strong sources far away
at infinity produce a finite field E in the region of interest. Note again that
we are interested in determining the potential energy of a given charge q
(and later, a system of charges) in the external field; we are not interested
in the potential energy of the sources producing the external electric field.

The external electric field E and the corresponding external potential
V may vary from point to point. By definition, V at a point P is the work

58 done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to the point P.

Reprint 2025-26

 EXAMPLE 2.4



Electrostatic Potential
and Capacitance

(We continue to take potential at infinity to be zero.) Thus, work done in
bringing a charge q from infinity to the point P in the external field is qV.
This work is stored in the form of potential energy of q. If the point P has
position vector r relative to some origin, we can write:

Potential energy of q at r in an external field

= qV (r) (2.27)

where V(r) is the external potential at the point r.
Thus, if an electron with charge q = e = 1.6×10–19 C is accelerated by

a potential difference of DV = 1 volt, it would gain energy of qDV = 1.6 ×
10–19J. This unit of energy is defined as 1 electron volt or 1eV, i.e.,
1 eV=1.6 × 10–19J. The units based on eV are most commonly used in
atomic, nuclear and particle physics, (1 keV = 103eV = 1.6 × 10–16J, 1 MeV
= 106eV = 1.6 × 10–13J, 1 GeV = 109eV = 1.6 × 10–10J and 1 TeV = 1012eV
= 1.6 × 10–7J). [This has already been defined on Page 117, XI Physics
Part I, Table 6.1.]

2.8.3  Potential energy of a dipole in an external field
Consider a dipole with charges q  = +q and q  = –q placed in a uniform

1 2
electric field E, as shown in Fig. 2.16.

As seen in the last chapter, in a uniform electric field,
the dipole experiences no net force; but experiences a
torque t given by

t = p × E (2.30)
which will tend to rotate it (unless p is parallel or
antiparallel to E). Suppose an external torque t is

ext 
applied in such a manner that it just neutralises this
torque and rotates it in the plane of paper from angle q

0
to angle q  at an infinitesimal angular speed and without

angular acceleration. The amount of work done by the
external torque will be given by

This work is stored as the potential energy of the system. We can
then associate potential energy U(q ) with an inclination q  of the dipole.
Similar to other potential energies, there is a freedom in choosing the
angle where the potential energy U is taken to be zero. A natural choice
is to take q = p / 2. (An explanation for it is provided towards the end of

We note that U¢ (q) differs from U(q ) by a quantity which is just a constant
for a given dipole. Since a constant is insignificant for potential energy, we
can drop the second term in Eq. (2.34) and it then reduces to Eq. (2.32).

We can now understand why we took q =p/2. In this case, the work

done against the external field E in bringing +q and – q are equal and
opposite and cancel out, i.e., q [V (r )  – V (r )]=0.

Example 2.6 A molecule of a substance has a permanent electric
dipole moment of magnitude 10–29 C m. A mole of this substance is
polarised (at low temperature) by applying a strong electrostatic field
of magnitude 106 V m–1. The direction of the field is suddenly changed
by an angle of 60º. Estimate the heat released by the substance in
aligning its dipoles along the new direction of the field. For simplicity,
assume 100% polarisation of the sample.

Solution   Here, dipole moment of each molecules = 10–29 C m
As 1 mole of the substance contains 6 × 1023 molecules,
total dipole moment of all the molecules, p = 6 × 1023 × 10–29 C m

    = 6 × 10–6 C m
 

Initial potential energy, U  = –pE cos q = –6×10–6×106 cos 0° = –6 J
i

Final potential energy (when q = 60°), U  = –6 × 10–6 × 106 cos 60° = –3 J
f

Change in potential energy = –3 J – (–6J) = 3 J
So, there is loss in potential energy. This must be the energy released
by the substance in the form of heat in aligning its dipoles.

2.9  ELECTROSTATICS OF CONDUCTORS

Conductors and insulators were described briefly in Chapter 1.
Conductors contain mobile charge carriers. In metallic conductors, these
charge carriers are electrons. In a metal, the outer (valence) electrons
part away from their atoms and are free to move. These electrons are free
within the metal but not free  to leave the metal. The free electrons form a
kind of ‘gas’; they collide with each other and with the ions, and move
randomly in different directions. In an external electric field, they drift
against the direction of the field. The positive ions made up of the nuclei
and the bound electrons remain held in their fixed positions. In electrolytic
conductors, the charge carriers are both positive and negative ions; but 61

Reprint 2025-26

 EXAMPLE 2.6



Physics
the situation in this case is more involved – the movement of the charge
carriers is affected both by the external electric field as also by the
so-called chemical forces (see Chapter 3). We shall restrict our discussion
to metallic solid conductors. Let us note important results regarding
electrostatics of conductors.

1. Inside a conductor, electrostatic field is zero
Consider a conductor, neutral or charged. There may also be an external
electrostatic field. In the static situation, when there is no current inside
or on the surface of the conductor, the electric field is zero everywhere
inside the conductor. This fact can be taken as the defining property of a
conductor. A conductor has free electrons. As long as electric field is not
zero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift. In the
static situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that the
electric field is zero everywhere inside. Electrostatic field is zero inside a
conductor.

2. At the surface of a charged conductor, electrostatic field
must be normal to the surface at every point

If E were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zero
component along the surface. Free charges on the surface of the conductor
would then experience force and move. In the static situation, therefore,
E should have no tangential component. Thus electrostatic field at the
surface of a charged conductor must be normal to the surface at every
point. (For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zero
even at the surface.) See result 5.

3. The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in
the static situation

A neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges
in every small volume or surface element. When the conductor is charged,
the excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation.
This follows from the Gauss’s law. Consider any arbitrary volume element
v inside a conductor. On the closed surface S bounding the volume
element v, electrostatic field is zero. Thus the total electric flux through S
is zero. Hence, by Gauss’s law, there is no net charge enclosed by S. But
the surface S can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume v can be
made vanishingly small. This means there is no net charge at any point
inside the conductor, and any excess charge must reside at the surface.

4. Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume
of the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on
its surface

This follows from results 1 and 2 above. Since E = 0 inside the conductor
and has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done in
moving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface. That
is, there is no potential difference between any two points inside or on

62 the surface of the conductor. Hence, the result. If the conductor is charged,

Reprint 2025-26



Electrostatic Potential
and Capacitance

electric field normal to the surface exists; this means potential will be
different for the surface and a point just outside the surface.

In a system of conductors of arbitrary size, shape and
charge configuration, each conductor is characterised by a constant
value of potential, but this constant may differ from one conductor to
the other.

5. Electric field at the surface of a charged conductor

where s is the surface charge density and n̂  is a unit vector normal
to the surface in the outward direction.

To derive the result, choose a pill box (a short cylinder) as the Gaussian
surface about any point P on the surface, as shown in Fig. 2.17. The pill
box is partly inside and partly outside the surface of the conductor. It
has a small area of cross section d S and negligible height.

Just inside the surface, the electrostatic field is zero; just outside, the
field is normal to the surface with magnitude E. Thus,
the contribution to the total flux through the pill box
comes only from the outside (circular) cross-section
of the pill box. This equals  ± EdS (positive for s > 0,
negative for s < 0), since over the small area dS, E
may be considered constant and E and dS are parallel
or antiparallel. The charge enclosed by the pill box
is  sdS.

Including the fact that electric field is normal to the FIGURE 2.17 The Gaussian surface

is true for both signs of s. For s > 0, electric field is for electric field at the surface of a

is normal to the surface inward.

6. Electrostatic shielding
Consider a conductor with a cavity, with no charges inside the cavity. A
remarkable result is that the electric field inside the cavity is zero, whatever
be the size and shape of the cavity and whatever be the charge on the
conductor and the external fields in which it might be placed. We have
proved a simple case of this result already: the electric field inside a charged
spherical shell is zero. The proof of the result for the shell makes use of
the spherical symmetry of the shell (see Chapter 1). But the vanishing of
electric field in the (charge-free) cavity of a conductor is, as mentioned
above, a very general result. A related result is that even if the conductor 63

is charged or charges are induced on a neutral
conductor by an external field, all charges reside
only on the outer surface of a conductor with cavity.

The proofs of the results noted in Fig. 2.18 are
omitted here, but we note their important
implication. Whatever be the charge and field
configuration outside, any cavity in a conductor
remains shielded from outside electric influence: the
field inside the cavity is always zero. This is known
as electrostatic shielding. The effect can be made
use of in protecting sensitive instruments from

Solution
(a) This is because the comb gets charged by friction. The molecules

in the paper gets polarised by the charged comb, resulting  in a
net force of attraction. If the hair is wet, or if it is rainy day, friction
between hair and the comb reduces. The comb does not get
charged and thus it will not attract small bits of paper.

2.10  DIELECTRICS AND POLARISATION

Dielectrics are non-conducting substances. In contrast to conductors,
they have no (or negligible number of ) charge carriers. Recall from Section
2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an
external electric field. The free charge carriers move
and charge distribution in the conductor adjusts
itself in such a way that the electric field due to
induced charges opposes the external field within
the conductor. This happens until, in the static
situation, the two fields cancel each other and the
net electrostatic field in the conductor is zero. In a
dielectric, this free movement of charges is not
possible. It turns out that the external field induces
dipole moment by stretching or re-orienting
molecules of the dielectric. The collective effect of all
the molecular dipole moments is net charges on the
surface of the dielectric which produce a field that FIGURE 2.20 Difference in behaviour

of a conductor and a dielectric
opposes the external field. Unlike in a conductor,

in an external electric field.
however, the opposing field so induced does not
exactly cancel the external field. It only reduces it.
The extent of the effect depends on the
nature of the dielectric. To understand the
effect, we need to look at the charge
distribution of a dielectric at the
molecular level.

The molecules of a substance may be
polar or non-polar. In a non-polar
molecule, the centres of positive and
negative charges coincide. The molecule
then has no permanent (or intrinsic) dipole
moment. Examples of non-polar molecules
are oxygen (O ) and hydrogen (H )

2 2
molecules which, because of their
symmetry, have no dipole moment. On the
other hand, a polar molecule is one in which
the centres of positive and negative charges
are separated (even when there is no

FIGURE 2.21 Some examples of polar
external field). Such molecules have a

permanent dipole moment. An ionic
molecule such as HCl or a molecule of water
(H O) are examples of polar molecules. 65

Reprint 2025-26

 EXAMPLE 2.7



Physics
In an external electric field, the

positive and negative charges of a non-
polar molecule are displaced in opposite
directions. The displacement stops when
the external force on the constituent
charges of the molecule is balanced by
the restoring force (due to internal fields
in the molecule). The non-polar molecule
thus develops an induced dipole moment.
The dielectric is said to be polarised by
the external field. We consider only the
simple situation when the induced dipole
moment is in the direction of the field and
is proportional to the field strength.
(Substances for which this assumption
is true are called linear isotropic
dielectrics.) The induced dipole moments
of different molecules add up giving a net
dipole moment of the dielectric in the
presence of the external field.

A dielectric with polar molecules also
develops a net dipole moment in an
external field, but for a different reason.

FIGURE 2.22 A dielectric develops a net dipole In the absence of any external field, the
moment in an external electric field. (a) Non-polar different permanent dipoles are oriented

randomly due to thermal agitation; so
the total dipole moment is zero. When

an external field is applied, the individual dipole moments tend  to align
with the field. When summed overall the molecules, there is then a net
dipole moment in the direction of the external field, i.e., the dielectric is
polarised. The extent of polarisation depends on the relative strength of
two mutually opposite factors: the dipole potential energy in the external
field tending to align the dipoles with the field and thermal energy tending
to disrupt the alignment. There may be, in addition, the  ‘induced dipole
moment’ effect as for non-polar molecules, but generally the alignment
effect is more important for polar molecules.

Thus in either case, whether polar or non-polar, a dielectric develops
a net dipole moment in the presence of an external field. The dipole
moment per unit volume is called polarisation and is denoted by P. For
linear isotropic dielectrics,

P = ε0χe E (2.37)

where c  is a constant characteristic of the dielectric and is known as the
e

electric susceptibility of the dielectric medium.
It is possible to relate c  to the molecular properties of the substance,

e
but we shall not pursue that here.

The question is: how does the polarised dielectric modify the original
external field inside it? Let us consider, for simplicity, a rectangular
dielectric slab placed in a uniform external field E  parallel to two of its

every volume element Dv of the slab has a dipole moment
P Dv in the direction of the field. The volume element Dv  is
macroscopically small but contains a very large number of
molecular dipoles. Anywhere inside the dielectric, the
volume element Dv has no net charge (though it has net
dipole moment). This is, because, the positive charge of one
dipole sits close to the negative charge of the adjacent dipole.
However, at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the
electric field, there is evidently a net charge density. As seen
in Fig 2.23, the positive ends of the dipoles remain
unneutralised at the right surface and the negative ends at
the left surface. The unbalanced charges are the induced
charges due to the external field.

Thus, the polarised dielectric is equivalent to two charged
surfaces with induced surface charge densities, say s

2.11  CAPACITORS AND CAPACITANCE

A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator
(Fig. 2.24). The conductors have charges, say Q  and Q , and potentials

1 2
V  and V . Usually, in practice, the two conductors have charges Q

1 2
and – Q, with potential difference V = V  – V  between them. We shall

1 2
consider only this kind of charge configuration of the capacitor. (Even a
single conductor can be used as a capacitor by assuming the other at
infinity.) The conductors may be so charged by connecting them to the
two terminals of a battery. Q is called the charge of the capacitor, though
this, in fact, is the charge on one of the conductors – the total charge  of
the capacitor  is zero.

The electric field in the region between the
conductors is proportional to the charge Q. That
is, if the charge on the capacitor is, say  doubled,
the electric field will also be doubled at every point.
(This follows from the direct proportionality
between field and charge implied by Coulomb’s
law and the superposition principle.) Now,
potential difference V is the work done per unit
positive charge in taking a small test charge from
the conductor 2 to 1 against the field. FIGURE 2.24 A system of two conductors

Physics
geometrical configuration (shape, size, separation) of the system of two
conductors. [As we shall see later, it also depends on the nature of the
insulator (dielectric) separating the two conductors.]  The SI unit of
capacitance is 1 farad (=1 coulomb volt-1) or 1 F = 1 C V–1. A capacitor
with fixed capacitance is symbolically shown as --||--, while the one with
variable capacitance is shown as  .

Equation (2.38) shows that for large C, V is small for a given Q. This
means a capacitor with large capacitance can hold large amount of charge
Q at a relatively small V. This is of practical importance. High potential
difference implies strong electric field around the conductors. A strong
electric field can ionise the surrounding air and accelerate the charges so
produced to the oppositely charged plates, thereby neutralising the charge
on the capacitor plates, at least partly. In other words, the charge of the
capacitor leaks away due to the reduction in insulating power of the
intervening medium.

The maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstand
without break-down (of its insulating property) is called its dielectric
strength; for air it is about 3 × 106 Vm–1. For a separation between
conductors of the order of 1 cm or so, this field corresponds to a potential
difference of 3 × 104 V between the conductors. Thus, for a capacitor to
store a large amount of charge without  leaking, its capacitance should
be high enough so that the potential difference and hence the electric
field do not exceed the break-down limits. Put differently, there is a limit
to the amount of charge that can be stored on a given capacitor without
significant leaking. In practice, a farad is a very big unit; the most common
units are its sub-multiples 1 mF = 10–6 F, 1 nF = 10–9 F, 1 pF = 10–12 F,
etc. Besides its use in storing charge, a capacitor is a key element of most
ac circuits with important functions, as described in Chapter 7.

2.12  THE PARALLEL PLATE CAPACITOR

A parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting
plates separated by a small distance (Fig. 2.25). We first take the

intervening medium between the plates to be
vacuum. The effect of a dielectric medium between
the plates is discussed in the next section. Let A be
the area of each plate and d the separation between
them. The two plates have charges Q and –Q. Since
d is much smaller than the linear dimension of the
plates (d2 << A), we can use the result on electric
field by an infinite plane sheet of uniform surface
charge density (Section 1.15). Plate 1 has surface
charge density s = Q/A and plate 2 has a surface
charge density –s. Using Eq. (1.33), the electric field
in different regions is:

Outer region I (region  above the plate 1),

In the inner region between the plates 1 and 2, the electric fields due
to the two charged plates add up, giving

= σ + σ = σ Q
E =

2ε0 2ε0 ε0 ε (2.41)
0A

The direction of electric field is from the positive to the negative plate.
Thus, the electric field is localised between the two plates and is

uniform throughout. For plates with finite area, this will not be true near
the outer boundaries of the plates. The field lines bend outward at the
edges — an effect called ‘fringing of the field’. By the same token, s will
not be strictly uniform on the entire plate. [E and s are related by Eq.
(2.35).] However, for d2 << A, these effects can be ignored in the regions
sufficiently far from the edges, and the field there is given by Eq. (2.41).
Now for uniform electric field, potential difference is simply the electric
field times the distance between the plates, that is,

V E d =

ε0 A (2.42)

The capacitance C of the parallel plate capacitor is then

Q ε

which, as expected, depends only on the geometry of the system. For
typical values like A = 1 m2, d = 1 mm, we get

(You can check that if 1F= 1C V–1 = 1C (NC–1m)–1 = 1 C2 N–1m–1.)

This shows that 1F is too big a unit in practice, as remarked earlier.
Another way of seeing the ‘bigness’ of 1F is to calculate the area of the
plates needed to have C = 1F for a separation of, say 1 cm:

which is a plate about 30 km in length and breadth!

2.13  EFFECT OF DIELECTRIC ON CAPACITANCE

With the understanding of the behaviour of dielectrics in an external
field developed in Section 2.10, let us see how the capacitance of a parallel
plate capacitor is modified when a dielectric is present. As before, we
have two large plates, each of area A, separated by a distance d. The
charge on the plates is ±Q, corresponding to the charge density ±s (with
s = Q/A). When there is vacuum between the plates,

Consider next a dielectric inserted between the plates fully occupying
the intervening region. The dielectric is polarised by the field and, as
explained in Section 2.10, the effect is equivalent to two charged sheets
(at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the field) with surface charge
densities s  and –s . The electric field in the dielectric then corresponds

Eq. (2.54) for the case of a parallel plate capacitor, it holds good for any
type of capacitor and can, in fact, be viewed in general as a definition of
the dielectric constant of a substance.

Example 2.8 A slab of material of dielectric constant K has the same
area as the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor but has a thickness
(3/4)d, where d is the separation of the plates. How is the capacitance
changed when the slab is inserted between the plates?

capacitance depends on the way the individual
capacitors are combined. Two simple
possibilities are discussed below.

2.15  ENERGY STORED IN A CAPACITOR

A capacitor, as we have seen above, is a system of two conductors with
charge Q and –Q. To determine the energy stored in this configuration,
consider initially two uncharged conductors 1 and 2. Imagine next a
process of transferring charge from conductor 2 to conductor 1 bit by

Physics
bit, so that at the end, conductor 1 gets charge Q. By
charge conservation, conductor 2 has charge –Q at
the end (Fig 2.30 ).

In transferring positive charge from conductor 2
to conductor 1, work will be done externally, since at
any stage conductor 1 is at a higher potential than
conductor 2. To calculate the total work done, we first
calculate the work done in a small step involving
transfer of an infinitesimal (i.e., vanishingly small)
amount of charge. Consider the intermediate situation
when the conductors 1 and 2 have charges Q¢ and

FIGURE 2.30 (a) Work done in a small

step of building charge on conductor 1
V¢ between conductors 1 to 2 is Q¢/C, where C is the

from Q¢ to Q¢ + d Q¢. (b)  Total work done
in charging the capacitor may be capacitance of the system. Next imagine that a small
viewed as stored in the energy of charge d Q¢ is transferred from conductor 2 to 1. Work

conductor 1 increasing to Q¢+ d Q¢, is given by

Since electrostatic force is conservative, this work is stored in the form

of potential energy of the system. For the same reason, the final result for
potential energy [Eq. (2.69)] is independent of the manner in which the
charge configuration of the capacitor is built up. When the capacitor
discharges, this stored-up energy is released. It is possible to view the
potential energy of the capacitor as ‘stored’ in the electric field between
the plates. To see this, consider for simplicity, a parallel plate capacitor
[of area A (of each plate) and separation d between the plates].

of charges.

[Fig. 2.31(a)]. How much electrostatic energy is stored by the capacitor?

another 900 pF capacitor [Fig. 2.31(b)]. What is the electrostatic
energy stored by the system?

Q¢  = Q/2. This implies V¢  = V/2. The total energy of the system is

2 × Q 'V '= QV = 2.25 ×10−6 J

Thus in going from (a) to (b), though no charge is lost; the final
energy is only half the initial energy. Where has the remaining energy
gone?
There is a transient period before the system settles to the
situation (b). During this period, a transient current flows from
the first capacitor to the second. Energy is lost during this time in
the form of heat and electromagnetic radiation.

SUMMARY

1. Electrostatic force is a conservative force. Work done by an external
force (equal and opposite to the electrostatic force) in bringing a charge
q from a point R to a point P is q(V –V ), which is the difference in

P R

potential energy of charge q between the final and initial points.

2. Potential at a point is the work done per unit charge (by an external
agency) in bringing a charge from infinity to that point. Potential at a
point is arbitrary to within an additive constant, since it is the potential
difference between two points which is physically significant. If potential
at infinity is chosen to be zero; potential at a point with position vector
r due to a point charge Q placed at the origin is given is given by

point dipole of dipole moment p placed at the origin is

5. An equipotential surface is a surface over which potential has a constant
value. For a point charge, concentric spheres centred at a location of the
charge are equipotential surfaces. The electric field E at a point is
perpendicular to the equipotential surface through the point. E is in the
direction of the steepest decrease of potential.

The potential energy of a dipole moment p in a uniform electric field E

 8. Electrostatics field E is zero in the interior of a conductor; just outside
the surface of a charged conductor, E is normal to the surface given by

σ
E = nˆ

ε  where n̂  is the unit vector along the outward normal to the
0

surface and s is the surface charge density. Charges in a conductor can
reside only at its surface. Potential is constant within and on the surface
of a conductor. In a cavity within a conductor (with no charges), the
electric field is zero.

9.  A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator. Its
capacitance is defined by C = Q/V, where Q and –Q are the charges on the
two conductors and V is the potential difference between them. C is
determined purely geometrically, by the shapes, sizes and relative
positions of the two conductors. The unit of capacitance is farad:,
1 F = 1 C V –1. For a parallel plate capacitor (with vacuum between the
plates),

C = ε A

where A is the area of each plate and d the separation between them.

10. If the medium between the plates of a capacitor is filled with an insulating
substance (dielectric), the electric field due to the charged plates induces
a net dipole moment in the dielectric. This effect, called polarisation,
gives rise to a field in the opposite direction. The net electric field inside
the dielectric and hence the potential difference between the plates is
thus reduced. Consequently, the capacitance C increases from its value

POINTS TO PONDER

1. Electrostatics deals with forces between charges at rest. But if there is a
force on a charge, how can it be at rest? Thus, when we are talking of
electrostatic force between charges, it should be understood that each
charge is being kept at rest by some unspecified force that opposes the
net Coulomb force on the charge.

2. A capacitor is so configured that it confines the electric field lines within
a small region of space. Thus, even though field may have considerable
strength, the potential difference between the two conductors of a
capacitor is small.

3. Electric field is discontinuous across the surface of a spherical charged
σ

shell. It is zero inside and ε n̂ outside. Electric potential is, however
0

continuous across the surface, equal to q/4pe R  at the surface.
0

4. The torque p × E on a dipole causes it to oscillate about E. Only if there
is a dissipative mechanism, the oscillations are damped and the dipole
eventually aligns with E.

5. Potential due to a charge q at its own location is not defined – it is
infinite.

6. In the expression qV (r) for potential energy of a charge q, V (r) is the

CURRENT
ELECTRICITY

3.1  INTRODUCTION

In Chapter 1, all charges whether free or bound, were considered to be at
rest. Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur
naturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in
which charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere,
sometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not
steady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow
in a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a
cell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we
shall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.

3.2  ELECTRIC CURRENT

Imagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both
the positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward
across the area. In a given time interval t, let q  be the net amount (i.e.,

+

forward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward
direction across the area. Similarly, let q  be the net amount of negative

–

charge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount
of charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time
interval t, then, is q = q – q . This is proportional to t for steady current

t
is defined to be the current across the area in the forward direction. (If it
turn out to be a negative number, it implies a current in the backward
direction.)

Currents are not always steady and hence more generally, we define
the current as follows. Let DQ be the net charge flowing across a cross-
section of a conductor during the time interval Dt [i.e., between times t
and (t + Dt)]. Then, the current at time t across the cross-section of the
conductor is defined as the value of the ratio of DQ to Dt in the limit of Dt
tending to zero,

( ) ∆Q
I t ≡ lim (3.2)

∆t →0 ∆t
In SI units, the unit of current is ampere. An ampere is defined

through magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following
chapter. An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in
domestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order
of tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in
our nerves are in microamperes.

3.3 ELECTRIC CURRENTS IN CONDUCTORS

An electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied. If it is
free to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free
charged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the
ionosphere. However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged
electrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and
are thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a
gram of water, for example, contains approximately 1022 molecules. These
molecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached
to individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound,
i.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In other
materials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move
within the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors,
develop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.

If we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly
bound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively
charged electrons. There are, however, other types of conductors like
electrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move.
In our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the
current is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background
of fixed positive ions.

Consider first the case when no electric field is present. The electrons
will be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the
fixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed
as before the collision. However, the direction of its velocity after the
collision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferential

82 direction for the velocities of the electrons. Thus on the average, the

Reprint 2025-26



Current
Electricity

number of electrons travelling in any direction will be equal to the number
of electrons travelling in the opposite direction. So, there will be no net
electric current.

Let us now see what happens to such a
piece of conductor if an electric field is applied.
To focus our thoughts, imagine the conductor
in the shape of a cylinder of radius R (Fig. 3.1).
Suppose we now take two thin circular discs FIGURE 3.1 Charges +Q and –Q put at the ends
of a dielectric of the same radius and put of a metallic cylinder. The electrons will drift

and similarly –Q at the other disc. We attach neutralise the charges. The current thus

is directed from the positive towards the
negative charge. The electrons will be accelerated due to this field towards
+Q. They will thus move to neutralise the charges. The electrons, as long
as they are moving, will constitute an electric current. Hence in the
situation considered, there will be a current for a very short while and no
current thereafter.

We can also imagine a mechanism where the ends of the cylinder are
supplied with fresh charges to make up for any charges neutralised by
electrons moving inside the conductor. In that case, there will be a steady
electric field in the body of the conductor. This will result in a continuous
current rather than a current for a short period of time. Mechanisms,
which maintain a steady electric field are cells or batteries that we shall
study  later in this chapter. In the next sections, we shall study the steady
current that results from a steady electric field in conductors.

3.4  OHM’S LAW

A basic law regarding flow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in
1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currents
was discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current I is flowing
and let V be the potential difference between the ends of the conductor.
Then Ohm’s law states that

     V µ I

or, V = R I (3.3)

where the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance of the
conductor. The SI units of resistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbol
W. The resistance R not only depends on the material of the conductor
but also on the dimensions of the conductor. The dependence of R on the
dimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows. FIGURE 3.2

        E l = j r l

The above relation for magnitudes E and j can indeed be cast in a

vector  form. The current density, (which we have defined as the current
through unit area normal to the current) is also directed along E, and is
also a vector j (º j E/E). Thus, the last equation can be written as,

        E = jr (3.12)

or,   j = s E (3.13)

where s º1/r is called the conductivity. Ohm’s law is often stated in an
equivalent form, Eq. (3.13) in addition to Eq.(3.3). In the next section, we
will try to understand the origin of the Ohm’s law as arising from the
characteristics of the drift of electrons.

3.5 DRIFT OF ELECTRONS AND THE ORIGIN

OF RESISTIVITY

As remarked before, an electron will suffer collisions with the heavy fixed
ions, but after collision, it will emerge with the same speed but in random
directions. If we consider all the electrons, their average velocity will be
zero since their directions are random. Thus, if there are N electrons and
the velocity of the ith electron (i = 1, 2, 3, ... N ) at a given time is v , then

Consider now the situation when an electric field is
present. Electrons will be accelerated due to this
field by

where –e is the charge and m is the mass of an electron.
Consider again the ith electron at a given time t. This
electron would have had its last collision some time
before t, and let t  be the time elapsed after its last

collision. If v  was its velocity immediately after the last

This last result is surprising. It tells us that the

electrons move with an average velocity which is
independent of time, although electrons are
accelerated. This is the phenomenon of drift and the
velocity v  in Eq. (3.17) is called the drift velocity.

d
Because of the drift, there will be net transport of

charges across any area perpendicular to E. Consider
a planar area A, located inside the conductor such that

We thus see that a very simple picture of electrical conduction
reproduces Ohm’s law. We have, of course, made assumptions that t
and n are constants, independent of E. We shall, in the next section,
discuss the limitations of Ohm’s law.

Example 3.1 (a) Estimate the average drift speed of conduction
electrons in a copper wire of cross-sectional area 1.0 × 10–7 m2 carrying
a current of 1.5 A. Assume that each copper atom contributes roughly
one conduction electron. The density of copper is 9.0 × 103 kg/m3,
and its atomic mass is 63.5 u. (b) Compare the drift speed obtained
above with, (i) thermal speeds of copper atoms at ordinary
temperatures, (ii) speed of propagation of electric field along the
conductor which causes the drift motion.

Solution
(a) The direction of drift velocity of conduction electrons is opposite

to the electric field direction, i.e., electrons drift in the direction
of increasing potential. The drift speed v  is given by Eq. (3.18)

d
v   = (I/neA)

d
Now, e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, A = 1.0 × 10–7m2, I = 1.5 A. The density of
conduction electrons, n is equal to the number of atoms per cubic
metre (assuming one conduction electron per Cu atom as is
reasonable from its valence electron count of one). A cubic metre
of copper has a mass of 9.0 × 103 kg. Since 6.0 × 1023 copper
atoms have a mass of 63.5 g,

n = × 9.0 ×106

    = 1.1 × 10–3 m s–1  = 1.1 mm s–1

(b) (i) At a temperature T, the thermal speed* of a copper atom of
mass M is obtained from [<(1/2) 2

constant. For copper at 300 K, this is about 2 × 102 m/s. This
figure indicates the random vibrational speeds of copper atoms
in a conductor. Note that the drift speed of electrons is much
smaller, about 10–5 times the typical thermal speed at ordinary
temperatures.
(ii) An electric field travelling along the conductor has a speed of
an electromagnetic wave, namely equal to 3.0 × 108 m s–1

(You will learn about this in Chapter 8). The drift speed is, in
comparison, extremely small; smaller by a factor of 10–11.

 EXAMPLE 3.1



Physics

Example 3.2

(a) In Example 3.1, the electron drift speed is estimated to be only a
few mm s–1 for currents in the range of a few amperes? How then
is current established almost the instant a circuit is closed?

(b) The electron drift arises due to the force experienced by electrons
in the electric field inside the conductor. But force should cause
acceleration. Why then do the electrons acquire a steady average
drift speed?

(c) If the electron drift speed is so small, and the electron’s charge is
small, how can we still obtain large amounts of current in a
conductor?

(d) When electrons drift in a metal from lower to higher potential,
does it mean that all the ‘free’ electrons of the metal are moving
in the same direction?

(e) Are the paths of electrons straight lines between successive
collisions (with the positive ions of the metal) in the (i) absence of
electric field, (ii) presence of electric field?

Solution
(a) Electric field is established throughout the circuit, almost instantly

(with the speed of light) causing at every point a local electron
drift. Establishment of a current does not have to wait for electrons
from one end of the conductor travelling to the other end. However,
it does take a little while for the current to reach its steady value.

(b) Each ‘free’ electron does accelerate, increasing its drift speed until
it collides with a positive ion of the metal. It loses its drift speed
after collision but starts to accelerate and increases its drift speed
again only to suffer a collision again and so on. On the average,
therefore, electrons acquire only a drift speed.

(c) Simple, because the electron number density is enormous,
~1029 m–3.

(d) By no means. The drift velocity is superposed over the large
random velocities of electrons.

(e) In the absence of electric field, the paths are straight lines; in the
presence of electric field, the paths are, in general, curved.

3.5.1  Mobility
As we have seen, conductivity arises from mobile charge carriers. In
metals, these mobile charge carriers are electrons; in an ionised gas, they
are electrons and positive charged ions; in an electrolyte, these can be
both positive and negative ions.

An important quantity is the mobility m defined as the magnitude of
the drift velocity per unit electric field:

in Chapter 14.

scales for negative and positive
values of the voltage and current.

(c) The relation between V and I is not unique, i.e., there is more than
one value of V for the same current I (Fig. 3.7). A material exhibiting
such behaviour is GaAs.
Materials and devices not obeying Ohm’s law in the form of Eq. (3.3)

are actually widely used in electronic circuits. In this and a few
subsequent chapters, however, we will study the electrical currents in
materials that obey Ohm’s law.

3.7  RESISTIVITY OF VARIOUS MATERIALS

The materials are classified as conductors, semiconductors and insulators
depending on their resistivities, in an increasing order of their values. 89

Reprint 2025-26



Physics
Metals have low resistivities in the range of 10–8 Wm to 10–6 Wm. At the
other end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having
resistivities 1018 times greater than metals or more. In between the two
are the semiconductors. These, however, have resistivities
characteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature. The resistivities
of semiconductors can be decreased by adding small amount of suitable
impurities. This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors for
electronic devices.

3.8 TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF RESISTIVITY

The resistivity of a material is found to be dependent on the temperature.
Different materials do not exhibit the same dependence on temperatures.
Over a limited range of temperatures, that is not too large, the resistivity
of a metallic conductor is approximately given by,

r  = r  [1 + a (T–T )] (3.26)
T 0 0

where r  is the resistivity at a temperature T and r  is the same at a
T 0

reference temperature T . a is called the temperature co-efficient of
0

resistivity, and from Eq. (3.26), the dimension of a is (Temperature)–1.
For  metals, a is positive.

The relation of Eq. (3.26) implies that a graph of r  plotted against T
T

would be a straight line. At temperatures much lower than 0°C, the graph,
however, deviates considerably from a straight line (Fig. 3.8).

Equation (3.26) thus, can be used approximately over a limited range
of T around any reference temperature T , where the graph can be

approximated as a straight line.

Some materials like Nichrome (which is an alloy of nickel, iron and

materials are thus widely used in wire bound standard resistors since

90 their resistance values would change very little with temperatures.

Reprint 2025-26



Current
Electricity

Unlike metals, the resistivities of semiconductors decrease with
increasing temperatures. A typical dependence is shown in Fig. 3.10.

We can qualitatively understand the temperature dependence of
resistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq. (3.23). From this equation,
resistivity of a material is given by

ρ = 1 = m

σ 2 (3.27)
n e τ

r thus depends inversely both on the number n of free electrons per unit
volume and on the average time t between collisions. As we increase
temperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers of
current, increases resulting in more frequent collisions. The average time
of collisions t, thus decreases with temperature.

In a metal, n is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable
extent and thus the decrease in the value of t with rise in temperature
causes r to increase as we have observed.

For insulators and semiconductors, however, n increases with
temperature. This increase more than compensates any decrease in t in
Eq.(3.23) so that for such materials, r decreases with temperature.

Example 3.3 An electric toaster uses nichrome for its heating
element. When a negligibly small current passes through it, its
resistance at room temperature (27.0 °C) is found to be 75.3 W. When
the toaster is connected to a 230 V supply, the current settles, after
a few seconds, to a steady value of 2.68 A. What is the steady
temperature of the nichrome element? The temperature coefficient
of resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature range
involved, is 1.70 × 10–4 °C–1.

Solution  When the current through the element is very small, heating
effects can be ignored and the temperature T  of the element is the

1
same as room temperature. When the toaster is connected to the
supply, its initial current will be slightly higher than its steady value
of 2.68 A. But due to heating effect of the current, the temperature
will rise. This will cause an increase in resistance and a slight
decrease in current. In a few seconds, a steady state will be reached
when temperature will rise no further, and both the resistance of the
element and the current drawn will achieve steady values. The
resistance R  at the steady temperature T  is

3.9  ELECTRICAL ENERGY, POWER

Consider a conductor with end points A and B, in which a current I is
flowing from A to B. The electric potential at A and B are denoted by V (A)
and V (B) respectively. Since current is flowing from A to B, V (A) > V (B)
and the potential difference across  AB is V = V(A) – V(B) > 0.

In a time interval Dt, an amount of charge DQ = I Dt travels from A to
B. The potential energy of the charge at A, by definition, was Q V (A) and
similarly at B, it is Q V(B). Thus, change in its potential energy DU  is

pot
DU  = Final potential energy – Initial potential energy

pot
         = DQ[(V (B) – V (A)] = –DQ V
         = –I VDt < 0 (3.28)
If charges moved without collisions through the conductor, their

kinetic energy would also change so that the total energy is unchanged.
Conservation of total energy would then imply that,

DK =  –DU (3.29)
pot

that is,

DK = I VDt > 0 (3.30)

Thus, in case charges were moving freely through the conductor under
the action of electric field, their kinetic energy would increase as they
move. We have, however, seen earlier that on the average, charge carriers
do not move with acceleration but with a steady drift velocity. This is
because of the collisions with ions and atoms during transit. During
collisions, the energy gained by the charges thus is shared with the atoms.
The atoms vibrate more vigorously, i.e., the conductor heats up. Thus,
in an actual conductor, an amount of energy dissipated as heat in the
conductor during the time interval Dt is,

DW = I VDt (3.31)
The energy dissipated per unit time is the power dissipated

P = DW/Dt  and we have,

92 P = I V (3.32)

Using Ohm’s law V = IR, we get

P = I 2 R = V 2/R (3.33)

as the power loss (“ohmic loss”) in a conductor of resistance R carrying a
current I. It is this power which heats up, for example, the coil of an
electric bulb to incandescence, radiating out heat and light.

Where does the power come from? As we have
reasoned before, we need an external source to keep
a steady current through the conductor. It is clearly
this source which must supply this power. In the
simple circuit shown with a cell (Fig.3.11), it is the
chemical energy of the cell which supplies this power
for as long as it can.

The expressions for power, Eqs. (3.32) and (3.33),
show the dependence of the power dissipated in a
resistor R on the current through it and the voltage FIGURE 3.11 Heat is produced in the

may be hundreds of miles away, via transmission
cables. One obviously wants to minimise the power
loss in the transmission cables connecting the power stations to homes
and factories. We shall  see now how this can be achieved. Consider a
device R, to which a power P is to be delivered via transmission cables
having a resistance R  to be dissipated by it finally. If V is the voltage

across R and I the current through it, then

P = V I (3.34)

resistance R . The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which is

connecting wires is inversely proportional to V 2. The  transmission cables

of V and this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmission
lines — a common sight as we move away from populated areas. Using
electricity at such voltages is not safe and hence at the other end, a device
called a transformer lowers the voltage to a value suitable for use.

3.10 CELLS, EMF, INTERNAL RESISTANCE

We have already mentioned that a simple device to maintain a steady
current in an electric circuit is the electrolytic cell. Basically a cell has
two electrodes, called the positive (P) and the negative (N), as shown in 93

A in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative

marked as B in the figure. When there is no current, the electrolyte
has the same potential throughout, so that the potential difference
between P and N is V  – (–V ) = V  + V  . This difference is called the

electromotive force (emf) of the cell and is denoted by e. Thus

e = V +V  > 0 (3.36)

Note that e is, actually, a potential difference and not a force. The
name emf, however, is used because of historical reasons, and was
given at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly.

To understand the significance of e, consider a resistor R
connected across the cell (Fig. 3.12). A current I flows across R

made at P and N. Thus, emf e is the potential difference between the positive and

negative electrodes in an open circuit, i.e., when no current is
flowing through the cell.

If however R is finite, I is not zero. In that case the potential difference
between P and N is

V = V + V  – I r
+ –

   = e – I r (3.38)

Note the negative sign in the expression (I r ) for the potential difference
between A and B. This is because the current I flows from B to A in the
electrolyte.

In  practical calculations, internal resistances of cells in the circuit
may be neglected when the  current I is such that e >> I r. The actual
values of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internal
resistance of dry cells, however, is much higher than the common
electrolytic cells.

We also observe that since V is the potential difference across R, we
have from Ohm’s law

V = I  R (3.39)

3.11  CELLS IN SERIES AND IN PARALLEL

Like resistors, cells can be combined together in an electric circuit. And
like resistors, one can, for calculating currents and voltages in a circuit,
replace a combination of cells by an equivalent cell.

FIGURE 3.13 Two cells of emf’s e1 and e2 in the series. r1, r2 are their
internal resistances. For connections across A and C, the combination
can be considered as one cell of emf eeq and an internal resistance req.

Consider first  two cells in series (Fig. 3.13), where one terminal of the
two cells is joined together leaving the other terminal in either cell free.
e , e  are the emf’s of the two cells and r , r  their internal resistances,

respectively.

Let V (A), V (B), V (C) be the potentials at points A, B and C shown in
Fig. 3.13. Then V (A) – V (B) is the potential difference between the positive
and negative terminals of the first cell. We have already calculated it in
Eq. (3.38) and hence,

(3.41)
VAB ≡V (A) –V (B)= ε –

1 I r1

Similarly,

VBC ≡V (B) –V (C)= ε –
2 I r2 (3.42)

Hence, the potential difference between the terminals A and C of
the combination is

VAC ≡ V (A) – V (C)=   V (A) – V (B)  +   V (B) – V (C)  
       = (ε1 + ε2 ) – I (r1 + r2 ) (3.43)

If we wish to replace the combination by a single cell between A and
C of emf eeq and internal resistance req, we would have

V  = e – I r (3.44)

e  = e  – e          (e  > e ) (3.47)
eq 1 2 1 2

The rule for series combination clearly can be extended to any number
of cells:
(i) The equivalent emf of a series combination of n cells is just the sum of

their individual emf’s, and
(ii) The equivalent internal resistance of a series combination of n cells is

just the sum of their internal resistances.
This is so, when the current leaves each cell from the positive

electrode. If in the combination, the current leaves any cell from
the negative electrode, the emf of the cell enters the expression
for e  with a negative sign, as in Eq. (3.47).

eq
Next, consider a parallel combination of the cells (Fig. 3.14).

I  and I  are the currents leaving the positive electrodes of the
1 2
cells. At the point B , I  and I  flow in whereas the current I flows

3.12  KIRCHHOFF’S RULES second rules for circuits.

Electric circuits generally consist of a number of resistors
and cells interconnected sometimes in a complicated way.
The formulae we have derived earlier for series and parallel combinations
of resistors are not always sufficient to determine all the currents and
potential differences in the circuit. Two rules, called Kirchhoff’s rules,
are very useful for analysis of electric circuits.

Given a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by a
symbol, say I, and a directed arrow to indicate that a current I flows
along the resistor in the direction indicated. If ultimately I is determined
to be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of the
arrow. If I turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a direction
opposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some other
source of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled,
as well as, a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing through
the cell. This will tell us the potential difference, V = V (P) – V (N) = e – I r
[Eq. (3.38) between the positive terminal P and the negative terminal N; I
here is the current flowing from N to P through the cell]. If, while labelling
the current I through the cell one goes from P to N, then of course

V = e + I r (3.60)

Having clarified labelling, we now state the rules and the proof:
(a) Junction rule: At any junction, the sum of the currents entering

the junction is equal to the sum of currents leaving the junction
(Fig. 3.15). 97

GUSTAV ROBERT KIRCHHOFF (1824 –



Physics
This applies equally well if instead of a junction of
several lines, we consider a point in a line.

The proof of this rule follows from the fact that
when currents are steady, there is no accumulation
of charges at any junction or at any point in a line.
Thus, the total current flowing in, (which is the rate
at which charge flows into the junction), must equal
the total current flowing out.
(b) Loop rule: The algebraic sum of changes in

resistors and cells in the loop is zero

 EXAMPLE 3.5



Current
Electricity

Solution  The network is not reducible to a simple series and parallel
combinations of resistors. There is, however, a clear symmetry in the
problem which we can exploit to obtain the equivalent resistance of
the network.
The paths AA¢, AD and AB are obviously symmetrically placed in the
network. Thus, the current in each must be the same, say, I. Further,
at the corners A¢, B and D, the incoming current I must split equally
into the two outgoing branches. In this manner, the current in all
the 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of I, using
Kirchhoff’s first rule and the symmetry in the problem.
Next take a closed loop, say, ABCC¢EA, and apply Kirchhoff’s second
rule:

–IR – (1/2)IR – IR + e = 0
where R is the resistance of each edge and e the emf of battery. Thus,

5
e = I R

The equivalent resistance R  of the network is
eq

ε 5
Req = = R

3I 6

For R = 1 W, R  = (5/6) W and for e = 10 V, the total current (= 3I ) in
eq

the network is
3I = 10 V/(5/6) W = 12 A, i.e., I = 4 A

The current flowing in each edge can now be read off from the
Fig. 3.16.

It should be noted that because of the symmetry of the network, the
great power of Kirchhoff’s rules has not been very apparent in Example 3.5.
In a general network, there will be no such simplification due to symmetry,
and only by application of Kirchhoff’s rules to junctions and closed loops
(as many as necessary to solve the unknowns in the network) can we
handle the problem. This will be illustrated in Example 3.6.

Physics

Solution  Each branch of the network is assigned an unknown current
to be determined by the application of Kirchhoff’s rules. To reduce
the number of unknowns at the outset, the first rule of Kirchhoff is
used at every junction to assign the unknown current in each branch.
We then have three unknowns I , I  and I  which can be found by

1 2 3
applying the second rule of Kirchhoff to three different closed loops.
Kirchhoff’s second rule for the closed loop ADCA gives,

10 – 4(I – I ) + 2(I  + I  – I ) – I  = 0 [3.61(a)]
1 2 2 3 1 1

that is, 7I – 6I  – 2I  = 10
1 2 3

For the closed loop ABCA, we get
10 – 4I – 2 (I  + I ) – I  = 0

2 2 3 1

that is, I  + 6I  + 2I  =10 [3.61(b)]

For the closed loop BCDEB, we get
5 – 2 (I  + I ) – 2 (I  + I  – I ) = 0

2 3 2 3 1

that is, 2I  – 4I  – 4I  = –5 [3.61(c)]
1 2 3

Equations (3.61 a, b, c) are three simultaneous equations in three
unknowns. These can be solved by the usual method to give

It is easily verified that Kirchhoff’s second rule applied to the
remaining closed loops does not provide any additional independent
equation, that is, the above values of currents satisfy the second
rule for every closed loop of the network. For example, the total voltage

3.13  WHEATSTONE BRIDGE

As an application of Kirchhoff’s rules consider the circuit shown in
Fig. 3.18, which is called the Wheatstone bridge. The bridge has
four resistors R , R , R  and R . Across one pair of diagonally opposite

1 2 3 4
points (A and C in the figure) a source is connected. This (i.e., AC) is
called the battery arm. Between the other two vertices, B and D, a
galvanometer G (which is a device to detect currents) is connected. This
line, shown as BD in the figure, is called the galvanometer arm.

For simplicity, we assume that the cell has no internal resistance. In
general there will be currents flowing across all the resistors as well as a
current I  through G. Of special interest, is the case of a balanced bridge

g
where the resistors are such that I  = 0. We can easily get the balance

 This last equation relating the four resistors is called the balance

The Wheatstone bridge and its balance condition provide a practical
method for determination of an unknown resistance. Let us suppose we
have an unknown resistance, which we insert in the fourth arm; R  is

SUMMARY

1. Current through a given area of a conductor is the net charge passing
per unit time through the area.

2. To maintain a steady current, we must have a closed circuit in which
an external agency moves electric charge from lower to higher potential
energy. The work done per unit charge by the source in taking the
charge from lower to higher potential energy (i.e., from one terminal
of the source to the other) is called the electromotive force, or emf, of
the source. Note that the emf is not a force; it is the voltage difference

3. Ohm’s law: The electric current I flowing through a substance is
proportional to the voltage V across its ends, i.e., V µ I or V = RI,
where R is called the resistance of the substance. The unit of resistance
is ohm: 1W = 1 V A–1.

cross-sectional area A through the relation,

where r, called resistivity is a property of the material and depends on
temperature and pressure.

5. Electrical resistivity of substances varies over a very wide range. Metals
have low resistivity, in the range of 10–8 W m to 10–6 W m. Insulators
like glass and rubber have 1022 to 1024 times greater resistivity.
Semiconductors like Si and Ge lie roughly in the middle range of
resistivity on a logarithmic scale.

6. In most substances, the carriers of current are electrons; in some
cases, for example, ionic crystals and electrolytic liquids, positive and
negative ions carry the electric current.

the fractional increase in resistivity per unit increase in temperature.

(a) V depends on I non-linearly.
(b) the relation between V and I depends on the sign of V for the same

absolute value of V.

1. Current is a scalar although we represent current with an arrow.
Currents do not obey the  law of vector addition. That current is a
scalar also follows from it’s  definition. The current I through an area

I =  j . DS

2. Refer to V-I curves of a resistor and a diode as drawn in the text. A
resistor obeys Ohm’s law while a diode does not. The assertion that
V = IR is a statement of Ohm’s law is not true. This equation defines
resistance and it may be applied to all conducting devices whether
they obey Ohm’s law or not. The Ohm’s law asserts that the plot of I
versus V is linear i.e., R is independent of V.

Equation E = ρ j leads to another statement of Ohm’s law, i.e., a
conducting material obeys Ohm’s law when the resistivity of the
material does not depend on the magnitude and direction of applied
electric field.

3. Homogeneous conductors like silver or semiconductors like pure
germanium or germanium containing impurities obey Ohm’s law within
some range of electric field values. If the field becomes too strong,
there are departures from Ohm’s law in all cases.

4. Motion of conduction electrons in electric field E is the sum of (i)
motion due to random collisions and (ii) that due to E. The motion
due to random collisions averages to zero and does not contribute to
v  (Chapter 10, Textbook of Class XI). v  , thus is only due to applied

electric field on the electron.
5. The relation j = ρ v should be applied to each type of charge carriers

separately. In a conducting wire, the total current and charge density
arises from both positive and negative charges:

j = ρ  v  + ρ  v
+ + – –

ρ = ρ  + ρ
+ –

Now in a neutral wire carrying electric current,

ρ  = – ρ
+ –

Further, v+ ~ 0 which gives

ρ = 0

j = ρ  v
–

Thus, the relation j = ρ v does not apply to the total current charge
density.

6. Kirchhoff’s junction rule is based on conservation of charge and the
outgoing currents add up and are equal to incoming current at a
junction. Bending or reorienting the wire does not change the validity
of Kirchhoff’s junction rule.

MOVING CHARGES
AND MAGNETISM

4.1  INTRODUCTION

Both Electricity and Magnetism have been known for more than 2000
years. However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was
realised that they were intimately related. During a lecture demonstration
in the summer of 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed
that a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in a nearby
magnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon. He found
that the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which
has the straight wire as its centre and has its plane perpendicular to the
wire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is noticeable when the
current is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that the
earth’s magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the direction of the
current reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)]. The deflection
increases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to the
wire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in
concentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)]. Oersted
concluded that moving charges or currents produced a magnetic field
in the surrounding space.

Following this, there was intense experimentation. In 1864, the laws
obeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated by

James Maxwell who then realised that light was electromagnetic waves.
Radio waves were discovered by Hertz, and produced by  J.C.Bose and
G. Marconi by the end of the 19th century. A  remarkable scientific and
technological progress took place in the 20th century. This was due to
our increased understanding of electromagnetism and the invention of
devices for production, amplification, transmission and detection of
electromagnetic waves.

FIGURE 4.1 The magnetic field due to a straight long current-carrying

(b) the current moves into the plane of the paper. (c) The arrangement of
iron filings around the wire. The darkened ends of the needle represent

north poles. The effect of the earth’s magnetic field is neglected.

In this chapter, we will see how magnetic field exerts
forces on moving charged particles, like electrons, protons,
and current-carrying wires. We shall also learn how
currents produce magnetic fields. We shall see how
particles can be accelerated to very high energies in a
cyclotron. We shall study how currents and voltages are
detected by a galvanometer.

In this and subsequent Chapter on magnetism,
we adopt the following convention: A current or a

paper is depicted by a dot (¤). A current or a field going
into the plane of the paper is depicted by a cross ( )*.

smaller  unit (non-SI) called gauss (=10–4 tesla) is also often used. The
earth’s magnetic field is about 3.6 × 10–5 T.

4.2.3  Magnetic force on a current-carrying conductor
We can extend the analysis for force due to magnetic field on a single
moving charge to a straight rod carrying current. Consider a rod of a
uniform cross-sectional area A and length l. We shall assume one kind
of mobile carriers as in a conductor (here electrons). Let the number
density of these mobile charge carriers in it be n. Then the total number
of mobile charge carriers in it is nlA. For a steady current I in this
conducting rod, we may assume that each mobile carrier has an average
drift velocity v  (see Chapter 3). In the presence of an external magnetic

d
field B, the force on these carriers is:

F = (nlA)q v  ´ B
d

where q is the value of the charge on  a carrier.  Now nq v  is the current
d

density j and |(nq v )|A is the current I (see Chapter 3 for the discussion
d

of current and current density). Thus,
F = [(nq v )lA] × B = [ jAl ] ´ B

d 
   = Il ´ B (4.4)

where l is a vector of magnitude l, the length of the rod, and with a direction
identical to the current I. Note that the current I is not a vector. In the last
step leading to Eq. (4.4), we have transferred the vector sign from  j to l.

Equation (4.4) holds for a straight rod. In this equation, B is the
external magnetic field. It is not the field produced by the current-carrying
rod. If the wire has an arbitrary shape we can calculate the Lorentz force
on it by considering it as a collection of linear strips dl  and summing

and the charged particle is moving along the positive x-axis (Fig. 4.4),
which way would the Lorentz force be for (a) an electron (negative

Solution   The velocity v of particle is along the x-axis, while B, the
magnetic field is along the y-axis, so v × B is along the z-axis (screw

axis. (b) for a positive charge (proton) the force is along +z axis.

4.3  MOTION IN A MAGNETIC FIELD

We will now consider, in greater detail, the motion of a charge moving in
a  magnetic field.  We have learnt  in Mechanics (see Class XI book, Chapter
5) that a force on a particle does work if  the force has a component along
(or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle. In the case of motion
of a charge in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the
velocity of the particle. So no work is done and no change in the magnitude
of the velocity is produced (though the direction of momentum may be
changed). [Notice that this is unlike the force due to an electric field, qE,
which can have a component parallel (or antiparallel) to motion and thus
can transfer energy in addition to momentum.]

We shall consider motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic
field. First consider the case of v perpendicular to B.  The
perpendicular force, q v × B, acts as a centripetal force and
produces a circular motion perpendicular to the magnetic field.
The particle will describe a circle if v and B are  perpendicular
to each other (Fig. 4.5).

If velocity has a component along B, this component
remains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic field will
not be affected by the magnetic field. The motion in a plane
perpendicular to B is as before a circular one, thereby producing
a helical motion (Fig. 4.6).

You have already learnt in earlier classes (See Class XI,
Chapter 3) that if r is the radius of the circular path of a particle,
then a force of  2 

m v / r, acts perpendicular to the path towards
the centre of the circle, and is called the  centripetal force. If the

FIGURE 4.5 Circular motion velocity v is perpendicular to the magnetic field   B, the  magnetic
force is  perpendicular to both v and B and acts like a

centripetal force. It has a magnitude q v B.
Equating the two expressions for centripetal
force,

m  2
v /r = q v B, which gives

r =  m v / qB (4.5)

for the radius of the circle described by the
charged particle. The larger the  momentum,  the
larger is the radius and bigger the circle
described. If w is the angular frequency, then   v
= w  r. So,

w  = 2p n =  q B/ m [4.6(a)]
which is independent of the velocity or energy .
Here n is the frequency of rotation. The
independence of n from energy has important
application in the design of a cyclotron.

The time taken for one revolution is T= 2p/
w  º 1/n. If there is a  component of the velocity

particle would be a helical one (Fig. 4.6). The distance moved along
the magnetic field  in one rotation is called pitch p.  Using Eq. [4.6 (a)],
we have

p =   v T  =  2pm v  / q B [4.6(b)]

The radius of the circular component of motion is called the radius
of the helix.

a magnetic field of 6 × 10–4 T perpendicular to it?  What is its
frequency?  Calculate its energy in  keV. ( 1 eV = 1.6 × 10–19 J).

Solution Using Eq. (4.5) we find
r  = m v / (qB )  = 9 ×10–31 kg × 3 × 107  m s–1 / ( 1.6 × 10–19 C × 6 × 10–4 T )

4.4 MAGNETIC F IELD DUE TO A CURRENT

ELEMENT, BIOT-SAVART LAW

All magnetic fields that we know are due to currents (or moving
charges) and due to intrinsic magnetic moments of particles.
Here, we shall study the relation between current and the
magnetic field it produces. It is given by the Biot-Savart’s  law.
Fig. 4.7 shows a finite conductor XY carrying current I. Consider
an infinitesimal element dl of the conductor. The magnetic field
dB due to this element is to be determined at a point P which is at
a distance r from it. Let q be the angle between dl and the
displacement vector r. According to Biot-Savart’s law, the
magnitude of the magnetic field dB is proportional to the current
I, the element length |dl|, and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance r. Its direction* is perpendicular to the plane
containing dl and r . Thus, in vector notation,

The Biot-Savart law for the magnetic field has certain similarities, as
well as, differences with the Coulomb’s law for the electrostatic field. Some
of these are:
(i) Both are long range, since both depend inversely on the square of

distance from the source to the point of interest. The principle of
superposition applies to both fields. [In this connection, note that
the magnetic field is linear in the source I dl just as the electrostatic
field is linear in its source: the electric charge.]

(ii) The electrostatic field is produced by a scalar source, namely, the electric
charge. The magnetic field is produced by a vector source I dl.

(iii) The electrostatic field is along the displacement vector joining the
source and the field point. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the
plane containing the displacement vector r and the current element I dl.

(iv) There is an angle dependence in the Biot-Savart law which is not
present  in the electrostatic case. In Fig. 4.7, the magnetic field at any
point in  the direction of dl (the dashed line) is zero. Along this line,
θ = 0, sin θ = 0 and from Eq. [4.7(a)], |dB| = 0.
There is an interesting  relation between ε , the permittivity of free

In the next section, we shall use the Biot-Savart law to calculate the
magnetic field due to a circular loop.

4.5 MAGNETIC FIELD ON THE AXIS OF A CIRCULAR

CURRENT LOOP

In this section, we shall evaluate the magnetic field  due
to a circular coil along its axis. The evaluation entails
summing up the effect of infinitesimal current elements
(I dl) mentioned in the previous section. We assume that
the current I is steady and that the evaluation is carried
out in free space (i.e., vacuum).

Fig. 4.9 depicts a circular loop carrying a steady
current I. The loop is placed in the  plane with its
centre at the origin O and has a radius R. The x-axis is
the axis of the loop. We wish to calculate the magnetic
field at the point P on this axis. Let x be the distance of P
from the centre O of the loop.

Consider a conducting element dl of the loop. This is

will be perpendicular to the displacement vector from
the element to the axial point. For example, the element dl in Fig. 4.9 is
in the  plane, whereas, the displacement vector r from dl to the axial
point P is in the  plane. Hence |dl × r|=r dl. Thus,

plane formed by dl and r. It has an x-component dB  and a component

perpendicular to x-axis, dB . When the components perpendicular to

the x-axis are summed over, they cancel out and we obtain a null result.
For example, the dB  component due to dl is cancelled by the

contribution due to the diametrically opposite dl element, shown in
Fig. 4.9. Thus, only the x-component survives. The net contribution along

(b) For all segments of the semicircular arc, dl × r are all parallel to
each other (into the plane of the paper). All such contributions
add up in magnitude. Hence direction of B for a semicircular arc
is given by the right-hand rule and magnitude is half that of a

There is an alternative and appealing way in which the
Biot-Savart law may be expressed. Ampere’s circuital law
considers an open surface with a boundary (Fig. 4.12).
The surface has current passing through it. We consider
the boundary to be made up of a number of small line
elements. Consider one such element of length dl. We
take the value of the tangential component of the
magnetic field, B , at this element and multiply it by the FIGURE 4.12 117

possesses what is called a cylindrical symmetry. The field that
normally can depend on three coordinates depends only on one: r.
Whenever there is symmetry, the solutions simplify.

(ii) The field direction at any point on this circle is tangential to it.
Thus, the lines of constant magnitude of magnetic field form
concentric circles. Notice now, in Fig. 4.1(c), the iron filings form
concentric circles. These lines called magnetic field lines form closed
loops. This is unlike the electrostatic field lines which originate
from positive charges and end at negative charges. The expression
for the magnetic field of a straight wire provides a theoretical
justification to Oersted’s experiments.

(iii) Another interesting point to note is that even though the wire is
infinite, the field due to it at a non-zero distance is not infinite. It
tends to blow up only when we come very close to the wire. The
field is directly proportional to the current and inversely
proportional to the distance from the (infinitely long) current source.

(iv) There exists a simple rule to determine the direction of the magnetic
field due to a long wire. This rule, called the right-hand rule*, is:

Grasp the wire in your right hand with your extended thumb pointing
in the direction of the current. Your fingers will curl around in the
direction of the magnetic field.

Ampere’s circuital law is not new in content from Biot-Savart law.
Both relate the magnetic field and the current, and both express the same
physical consequences of a steady electrical current. Ampere’s law is to
Biot-Savart law, what Gauss’s law is to Coulomb’s law. Both, Ampere’s
and Gauss’s law relate a physical quantity on the periphery or boundary
(magnetic or electric field) to another physical quantity, namely, the source,
in the interior (current or charge). We also note that Ampere’s circuital
law holds for steady currents which do not fluctuate with time. The
following example will help us understand what is meant by the term
enclosed current.

Example 4.7 Figure 4.13 shows a long straight wire of a circular
cross-section (radius a) carrying steady current I. The current I is
uniformly distributed across this cross-section. Calculate the
magnetic field in the region r < a and r > a.

It should be noted that while Ampere’s circuital law holds for any

magnetic system: the solenoid.

4.7  THE SOLENOID

We shall discuss a long solenoid. By long solenoid we mean that the
solenoid’s length is large compared to its radius. It consists of a long wire
wound in the form of a helix where the neighbouring turns are closely
spaced. So each turn can be regarded as a circular loop.  The net magnetic
field is the vector sum of the fields due to all the turns. Enamelled wires
are used for winding so that turns are insulated from each other.

stretched out for clarity. Only the exterior semi-circular part is shown. Notice

how the circular loops between neighbouring turns tend to cancel.
(b) The magnetic field of a finite solenoid.

Figure 4.15 displays the magnetic field lines for a finite solenoid. We
show a section of this solenoid in an enlarged manner in Fig. 4.15(a).
Figure 4.15(b) shows the entire finite solenoid with its magnetic field. In
Fig. 4.15(a), it is clear from the circular loops that the field  between two
neighbouring turns vanishes. In Fig. 4.15(b), we see that the field at the
interior mid-point P is uniform, strong and along the axis of the solenoid.
The field at the exterior mid-point Q is weak and moreover is along the
axis of the solenoid with no perpendicular or normal component. As the

Physics
solenoid is made longer it appears like a long cylindrical metal sheet.
Figure 4.16 represents this idealised picture. The field outside the solenoid
approaches zero. We shall assume that the field outside is zero. The field
inside becomes everywhere parallel to the axis.

Consider a rectangular Amperian loop abcd. Along cd the field is zero
as argued above. Along transverse sections bc and ad, the field component
is zero. Thus, these two sections  make no contribution. Let the field along
ab be B. Thus, the relevant length of the Amperian loop is, L = h.

Let n be the number of turns per unit length, then the total number
of turns is  nh. The enclosed current is,  I  = I (n h), where I is the current

BL =  µ I ,    B h = µ I (n h)

B = µ  n I (4.16)

The direction of the field is given by the right-hand rule. The solenoid
is commonly used to obtain a uniform magnetic field. We shall see in the
next chapter that a large field is possible by inserting a soft iron core
inside the solenoid.

Example 4.8 A solenoid of length 0.5 m has a radius of 1 cm and is
made up of 500 turns. It carries a current of 5 A. What is the
magnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid?

Solution  The number of turns per unit length is,

500
n = = 1000  turns/m

The length l = 0.5 m and radius r = 0.01 m. Thus, l/a = 50 i.e., l >> a .

CURRENTS, THE AMPERE
We have learnt that there exists a magnetic field due to a
conductor carrying a current which obeys the Biot-Savart
law. Further, we have learnt that an external magnetic field
will exert a force on a current-carrying conductor. This
follows from the Lorentz force formula. Thus, it is logical
to expect that two current-carrying conductors placed near
each other will exert (magnetic) forces on each other. In
the period 1820-25, Ampere studied the nature of this

Eq. (4.4),

ba
and directed towards ‘b’. Thus,

F  = –F (4.18)
ba ab

Note that this is consistent with Newton’s third Law. Thus, at least for
parallel conductors and steady currents, we have shown that the
Biot-Savart law and the Lorentz force yield results in accordance with
Newton’s third Law*.

We have seen from above that currents flowing in the same direction
attract each other. One can show that oppositely directed currents repel
each other. Thus,

Parallel currents attract, and antiparallel currents repel.
This rule is the opposite of what we find in electrostatics. Like (same

sign) charges repel each other, but like (parallel) currents attract each other.

motion, Newton’s third law may not hold for forces between charges and/or
conductors. An essential consequence of the Newton’s third law in mechanics
is conservation of momentum of an isolated system. This, however, holds even
for the case of time-dependent situations with electromagnetic fields, provided 123
the momentum carried by fields is also taken into account.

Physics
The ampere is the value of that steady current which, when maintained

in each of the two very long, straight, parallel conductors of negligible
cross-section, and placed one metre apart in vacuum, would produce
on  each of these conductors a force equal to  2 × 10–7 newtons per metre
of length.

This definition of the ampere was adopted in 1946. It is a theoretical
definition. In practice, one must eliminate the effect of the earth’s magnetic
field and substitute very long wires by multiturn coils of appropriate
geometries. An instrument called the current balance is used to measure
this mechanical force.

The SI unit of charge, namely, the coulomb, can now be defined in
terms of the ampere.

When a steady current of 1A is set up in a conductor, the quantity of
charge that flows through its cross-section in 1s is one coulomb (1C).

Example 4.9 The horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field
at a certain place is 3.0 ×10–5 T and the direction of the field is from
the geographic south to the geographic north. A very long straight
conductor is carrying a steady current of 1A. What is the force per
unit length on it when it is placed on a horizontal table and the
direction of the current is (a) east to west; (b) south to north?

Solution  F = Il × B
F = IlB sinθ
The force per unit length is
f = F/l = I B sinθ
(a) When the current is flowing from east to west,

θ = 90°
Hence,
f = I B
  = 1 × 3 × 10–5 = 3 × 10–5 N m–1

This is larger than the value 2×10–7 Nm–1 quoted in the definition
of the ampere. Hence it is important to eliminate the effect of the
earth’s magnetic field and other stray fields while standardising
the ampere.
The direction of the force is downwards. This direction may be
obtained by the directional property of cross product of vectors.

(b) When the current is flowing from south to north,
θ = 0o

f = 0
Hence there is no force on the conductor.

4.9  TORQUE ON CURRENT LOOP, MAGNETIC DIPOLE

magnetic field

We now show that a rectangular loop carrying a steady current I and
placed in a uniform magnetic field experiences a torque. It does not
experience a net force. This behaviour is analogous to that of electric

124 dipole in a uniform electric field (Section 1.11).

We first consider the simple case when the
rectangular loop is placed such that the uniform
magnetic field B is in the plane of the loop. This is
illustrated in Fig. 4.18(a).

The field exerts no force on the two arms AD and BC
of the loop. It is perpendicular to the arm AB of the loop
and exerts a force F  on it which is directed into the

plane of the loop. Its magnitude is,

F  = I b B

Similarly, it exerts a force F  on the arm CD and F

is directed out of the plane of the paper.

Thus, the net force on the loop is zero. There is a
torque on the loop due to the pair of forces F  and F .

The forces on the arms BC and DA are equal, opposite, and act along

the axis of the coil, which connects the centres of mass of BC and DA.
Being collinear along the axis they cancel each other, resulting in no net
force or torque. The forces on arms AB and CD are F  and F . They too

1 2
are equal and opposite, with magnitude,

F  = F  = I b B

But they are not collinear!  This results in a couple as before. The
torque is, however, less than the earlier case when plane of loop was
along the magnetic field. This is because the perpendicular distance
between the forces of the couple has decreased. Figure 4.19(b) is a view
of the arrangement from the AD end and it illustrates these two forces

Physics
As θ à 0, the perpendicular distance between

the forces of the couple also approaches zero. This
makes the forces collinear and the net force and
torque zero. The torques in Eqs. (4.20) and (4.21)
can be expressed as vector product of the magnetic
moment of the coil and the magnetic field.
We define the magnetic moment of the current
loop as,

m = I A (4.22)
where the direction of the area vector A is given
by the right-hand thumb rule and is directed into
the plane of the paper in Fig. 4.18. Then as the
angle between m and B is θ ,  Eqs. (4.20) and (4.21)
can be expressed by one expression

a torque which increases with the amount of rotation. The presence of
this torque is also the reason why a small magnet or any magnetic dipole
aligns itself with the external magnetic field.

If the loop has N closely wound turns, the expression for torque, Eq.
(4.23), still holds, with

m = N I A (4.24)

coil? (b) What is the magnetic moment of this coil?

The coil is placed in a vertical plane and is free to rotate about a
horizontal axis which coincides with its diameter. A uniform magnetic
field of 2T in the horizontal direction exists such that initially the axis
of the coil is in the direction of the field. The coil rotates through an
angle of 90° under the influence of the magnetic field. (c) What are the
magnitudes of the torques on the coil in the initial and final position?

the total field (external field + field produced by the loop) is
maximum.

 (c) A loop of irregular shape carrying current is located in an external
magnetic field. If the wire is flexible, why does it change to a
circular shape?

Solution
(a) No, because that would require τ to be in the vertical direction.

But τ = I A × B, and since A of the horizontal loop is in the vertical
direction, τ would be in the plane of the loop for any B.

(b) Orientation of stable equilibrium is one where the area vector A
of the loop is in the direction of external magnetic field. In this
orientation, the magnetic field produced by the loop is in the same
direction as external field, both normal to the  plane of the loop,
thus giving rise to maximum flux of the total field.

(c) It assumes circular shape with its plane normal to the field to
maximise flux, since for a given perimeter, a circle encloses greater
area than any other shape.

4.9.2  Circular current loop as a magnetic dipole

In this section, we shall consider the elementary magnetic element: the
current loop. We shall show that the magnetic field (at large distances)
due to current in a circular current loop is very similar in behaviour to
the electric field of an electric dipole. In Section 4.5, we have evaluated
the magnetic field on the axis of a circular loop, of a radius R, carrying a
steady current I. The magnitude of this field is [(Eq. (4.11)],

and its direction is along the axis and given by the right-hand thumb

The results given by Eqs. [4.25(a)] and [4.25(b)] become exact for a

The results obtained above can be shown to apply to any planar loop:

a planar current loop is equivalent to a magnetic dipole of dipole moment
m = I A, which is the analogue of electric dipole moment p. Note, however,
a fundamental difference: an electric dipole is built up of two elementary
units — the charges (or electric monopoles). In magnetism, a magnetic
dipole (or a current loop) is the most elementary element. The equivalent
of electric charges, i.e., magnetic monopoles, are not known to exist.

We have shown that a current loop (i) produces a magnetic field (see
Fig. 4.10) and behaves like a magnetic dipole at large distances, and
(ii) is subject to torque like a magnetic needle. This led Ampere to suggest
that all magnetism is due to circulating currents. This seems to be partly
true and no magnetic monopoles have been seen so far. However,
elementary particles such as an electron or a proton also carry an intrinsic
magnetic moment, not accounted by circulating currents.

4.10  THE MOVING COIL GALVANOMETER

Currents and voltages in circuits have been discussed extensively in
Chapters 3. But how do we measure them? How do we claim that
current in a circuit is 1.5 A or the voltage drop across a resistor is 1.2 V?
Figure 4.20 exhibits a very useful instrument for this purpose: the moving
coil galvanometer (MCG). It is a device whose principle can be understood
on the basis of our discussion in Section 4.9.

The galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns, free to rotate
about a fixed axis (Fig. 4.20), in a uniform radial magnetic field. There is
a cylindrical soft iron core which not only makes the field radial but also
increases the strength of the magnetic field.  When a current flows through
the coil, a torque acts on it. This torque is given by Eq. (4.20) to be

where the symbols have their usual meaning. Since
the field is radial by design, we have taken sin θ = 1 in
the above expression for the torque. The magnetic
torque NIAB tends to rotate the coil. A spring S

provides a counter torque kφ that balances the
magnetic torque NIAB; resulting in a steady angular
deflection φ. In equilibrium

kφ = NI AB

where k is the torsional constant of the spring; i.e. the
restoring torque per unit twist. The deflection φ is
indicated on the scale by a pointer attached to the
spring. We have

The galvanometer cannot as such be used as an

ammeter to measure the value of the current in a given circuit. This is for
two reasons: (i) Galvanometer is a very sensitive device, it gives a full-
scale deflection for a current of the order of µA. (ii) For measuring currents,
the galvanometer has to be connected in series, and as it has a large
resistance, this will change the value of the current in the circuit. To
overcome these difficulties, one attaches a small resistance r , called shunt

s
resistance, in parallel with the galvanometer coil; so that most of the
current passes through the shunt. The resistance of this arrangement is,

R  r / (R   + r )   ≃  r          if    R  >>  r

The galvanometer can also be used as a voltmeter to measure the
voltage across a given section of the circuit. For this it must be connected
in parallel with that section of the circuit. Further, it must draw a very
small current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the original
set up by an amount which is very large. Usually we like to keep the
disturbance due to the measuring device below one per cent.  To ensure
this, a large resistance R is connected in series with the galvanometer.
This arrangement is schematically depicted in Fig.4.22. Note that the
resistance of the voltmeter is now,

An interesting point to note is that increasing the current sensitivity
may not necessarily increase the voltage sensitivity. Let us take Eq. (4.27)
which provides a measure of current sensitivity. If N → 2N, i.e., we double
the number of turns, then

φ → φ

I I
Thus, the current sensitivity doubles. However, the resistance of the

galvanometer is also likely to double, since it is proportional to the length
of the wire. In Eq. (4.28), N →2N, and R →2R, thus the voltage sensitivity,

φ → φ
V V

remains unchanged. So in general, the modification needed for conversion
of a galvanometer to an ammeter  will be different from what is needed for
converting it into a voltmeter.

measured. What is the value of the current if the ammeter shown

 I =  3/3 = 1.00 A

SUMMARY

1. The total force on a charge q moving with velocity v in the presence of
magnetic and electric fields B and E, respectively is called the Lorentz
force. It is given by the expression:
F = q (v × B + E)
The magnetic force q (v × B) is normal to v and work done by it is zero.

2. A straight conductor of length l and carrying a steady current I
experiences a force F in a uniform external magnetic field B,
F = I l × B

where|l| = l and the direction of l is given by the direction of the
current.

3. In a uniform magnetic field B, a charge q executes a circular orbit in
a plane normal to B. Its frequency of uniform circular motion is called
the cyclotron frequency and is given by:

ν q B
=

c
2 πm

This frequency is independent of the particle’s speed and radius. This
fact is exploited in a machine, the cyclotron, which is used to
accelerate charged particles.

4. The Biot-Savart law asserts that the magnetic field dB due to an
element dl carrying a steady current I at a point P at a distance r from
the current element is:

µ d ×
d = 0 l r

To obtain the total field at P, we must integrate this vector expression
over the entire length of the conductor.

an area A possesses a magnetic moment m where,

m = N I A

and the direction of m is given by the right-hand thumb rule : curl
the palm of your right hand along the loop with the fingers pointing
in the direction of the current. The thumb sticking out gives the
direction of m (and A)

When this loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field B, the force F on
it is:  F = 0

And the torque on it is,

τ = m × B

In a moving coil galvanometer, this torque is balanced by a counter-
torque due to a spring, yielding

kφ = NI AB

where φ  is the equilibrium deflection and k the torsion constant of
the spring.

11. A moving coil galvanometer can be converted into a ammeter by
introducing a shunt resistance r , of small value in parallel. It can be

POINTS TO PONDER

1. Electrostatic field lines originate at a positive charge and terminate at a
negative charge or fade at infinity. Magnetic field lines always form
closed loops.

2. The discussion in this Chapter holds only for steady currents which do
not vary with time.
When currents vary with time Newton’s third law is valid only if momentum
carried by the electromagnetic field is taken into account.

3. Recall the expression for the Lorentz force,

F = q (v × B + E)

This velocity dependent force has occupied the attention of some of the
greatest scientific thinkers. If one switches to a frame with instantaneous
velocity v, the magnetic part of the force vanishes. The motion of the
charged particle is then explained by arguing that there exists an
appropriate electric field in the new frame. We shall not discuss the
details of this mechanism. However, we stress that the resolution of this
paradox implies that electricity and magnetism are linked phenomena
(electromagnetism) and that the Lorentz force expression does not imply
a universal preferred frame of reference in nature.

4. Ampere’s Circuital law is not independent of the Biot-Savart law. It
can be derived from the Biot-Savart law. Its relationship to the
Biot-Savart law is similar to the relationship between Gauss’s law and
Coulomb’s law.

MAGNETISM AND
MATTER

5.1  INTRODUCTION

Magnetic phenomena are universal in nature. Vast, distant galaxies, the
tiny invisible atoms, humans and beasts all are permeated through and
through with a host of magnetic fields from a variety of sources. The earth’s
magnetism predates human evolution. The word magnet is derived from
the name of an island in Greece called magnesia where magnetic ore
deposits were found, as early as 600 BC.

In the previous chapter we have learned that moving charges or electric
currents produce magnetic fields. This discovery, which was made in the
early part of the nineteenth century is credited to Oersted, Ampere, Biot
and Savart, among others.

In the present chapter, we take a look at magnetism as a subject in its
own right.

Some of the commonly known ideas regarding magnetism are:
(i) The earth behaves as a magnet with the magnetic field pointing

approximately from the geographic south to the north.
(ii) When a bar magnet is freely suspended, it points in  the north-south

direction. The tip which points to the geographic north is called the
north pole and the tip which points to the geographic south is called

136 the south pole of the magnet.

Reprint 2025-26



Magnetism and
Matter

(iii) There is a repulsive force when north poles ( or south poles ) of two
magnets are brought close together. Conversely, there is an attractive
force between the north pole of one magnet and the south pole of
the other.

(iv) We cannot isolate the north, or south pole of a magnet. If a bar magnet
is broken into two halves, we get two similar bar magnets with
somewhat weaker properties. Unlike electric charges, isolated magnetic
north and south poles known as magnetic monopoles do not exist.

(v) It is possible to make magnets out of iron and its alloys.
We begin with a description of a bar magnet and its behaviour in an

external magnetic field. We describe Gauss’s law of magnetism. We next
describe how materials can be classified on the basis of their magnetic
properties. We describe para-, dia-, and ferromagnetism.

5.2  THE BAR MAGNET

We begin our study by examining iron
filings sprinkled on a sheet of glass placed
over a short bar magnet. The arrangement
of iron filings is shown in Fig. 5.1.

 The pattern of iron filings suggests
that the magnet has two poles similar to
the positive and negative charge of an
electric dipole. As mentioned in the
introductory section, one pole is
designated the North pole and the other,
the South pole. When suspended freely,
these poles point approximately towards
the geographic north and south poles,
respectively. A similar pattern of iron
filings is observed around a current
carrying solenoid.

carrying solenoid in  Fig. 5.2. For
comparison refer to the Chapter 1, Figure 1.14(d). Electric field lines of an
electric dipole are also displayed in Fig. 5.2(c). The magnetic field lines are a
visual and intuitive realisation of the magnetic field. Their properties are:
(i) The magnetic field lines of a magnet (or a solenoid) form continuous

closed loops. This is unlike the electric dipole where these field lines
begin from a positive charge and end on the negative charge or escape
to infinity.

* In some textbooks the magnetic field lines are called magnetic lines of force.
This nomenclature is avoided since it can be confusing. Unlike electrostatics
the field lines in magnetism do not indicate the direction of the force on a 137
(moving) charge.

Magnetism and
Matter

The resemblance of magnetic field lines for a bar magnet and a solenoid
suggest that a bar magnet may be thought of as a large number of
circulating currents in analogy with a solenoid. Cutting a bar magnet in
half is like cutting a solenoid. We get two smaller solenoids with weaker
magnetic properties. The field lines remain continuous, emerging from
one face of the solenoid and entering into the other face. One can test this
analogy by moving a small compass needle in the neighbourhood of a
bar magnet and a current-carrying finite solenoid and noting that the
deflections of the needle are similar in both cases.

To make this analogy more firm we may calculate the axial field of a
finite solenoid depicted in Fig. 5.3 (a). We can demonstrate that at large
distances this axial field resembles that of a bar magnet.

This is also the far axial magnetic field of a bar magnet which one may
obtain experimentally. Thus, a bar magnet and a solenoid produce similar
magnetic fields. The magnetic moment of a bar magnet is thus equal to
the magnetic moment of an equivalent solenoid that produces the same
magnetic field.

5.2.3  The dipole in a uniform magnetic field
Let’s place a small compass needle of known magnetic moment m allowing
it to oscillate in the magnetic field. This arrangement is shown in
Fig. 5.3(b).

The torque on the needle is [see Eq. (4.23)],

τ = m × B (5.2)
In magnitude τ = mB sinθ
Here τ  is restoring torque and θ is the angle between m and B.

An expression for magnetic potential energy can be obtained on lines
similar to  electrostatic potential energy.
The magnetic potential energy U  is given by

m

U = ∫ τ(θ)dθ
m

      = ∫mB sinθ dθ = −mB cosθ

      = –m.B (5.3)
We have emphasised in Chapter 2 that the zero of potential energy

can be fixed at one’s convenience. Taking the constant of integration to be
zero means fixing the zero of potential energy at θ = 90°, i.e., when the
needle is perpendicular to the field. Equation (5.3) shows that potential
energy is minimum (= –mB) at θ = 0° (most stable position) and maximum
(= +mB) at θ = 180° (most unstable position).

(a) What happens if a bar magnet is cut into two pieces: (i) transverse

to its length, (ii) along its length?
(b) A magnetised needle in a uniform magnetic field experiences a

torque but no net force. An iron nail near a bar magnet, however,
experiences a force of attraction in addition to a torque. Why? 139

(c) Must every magnetic configuration have a north pole and a south
pole? What about the field due to a toroid?

(d) Two identical looking iron bars A and B are given, one of which
is definitely known to be magnetised. (We do not know which
one.) How would one ascertain whether or not both are
magnetised? If only one is magnetised, how does one ascertain
which one?  [Use nothing else but the bars A and B.]

Solution
(a) In either case, one gets two magnets, each with a north and

south pole.
(b) No force if the field is uniform. The iron nail experiences a non-

uniform field due to the bar magnet. There is induced magnetic
moment in the nail, therefore, it experiences both force and
torque. The net force is attractive because the induced south
pole (say) in the nail is closer to the north pole of magnet than
induced north pole.

(c) Not necessarily. True only if the source of the field has a net
non-zero magnetic moment. This is not so for a toroid or even for
a straight infinite conductor.

(d) Try to bring different ends of the bars closer. A repulsive force in
some situation establishes that both are magnetised. If it is
always attractive, then one of them is not magnetised. In a bar
magnet the intensity of the magnetic field is the strongest at the
two ends (poles) and weakest at the central region. This fact
may be used to  determine whether A or B is the magnet. In this
case, to see which one of the two bars is a magnet, pick up one,
(say, A) and lower one of its ends; first on one of the ends of the
other (say, B), and then on the middle of B. If you notice that in
the middle of B, A experiences no force, then B is magnetised. If
you do not notice any change from the end to the middle of B,
then A is magnetised.

5.2.4  The electrostatic analog
Comparison of Eqs. (5.1), (5.2) and (5.3) with the corresponding equations
for electric dipole (Chapter 1), suggests that magnetic field at large
distances due to a bar magnet of magnetic moment m can be obtained
from the equation for electric field due to an electric dipole of dipole moment
p, by making the following replacements:

5.3  MAGNETISM AND GAUSS’S LAW

In Chapter 1, we studied Gauss’s law for electrostatics.
In Fig 5.2(c), we see that for a closed surface represented
by  i , the number of lines leaving the surface is equal to
the number of lines entering it. This is consistent with the
fact that no net charge is enclosed by the surface. However,
in the same figure, for the closed surface ii , there is a net
outward flux, since it does include a net (positive) charge.

The situation is radically different for magnetic fields
which are continuous and form closed loops. Examine the
Gaussian surfaces represented by  i  or  ii  in Fig 5.2(a) or

Karl Friedrich Gauss Fig. 5.2(b). Both cases visually demonstrate that the
(1777 – 1855) He was a number of magnetic field lines leaving the surface is
child prodigy and was gifted balanced by the number of lines entering it. The net
in mathematics, physics, magnetic flux is zero for both the surfaces. This is true

and even land surveying.
The properties of numbers
fascinated him, and in his
work he anticipated major
mathematical development
of later times. Along with
Wilhelm Welser, he built the
first electric telegraph in
1833. His mathematical
theory of curved surface
laid the foundation for the
later work of Riemann.

Consider a small vector area element ∆S of a closed surface S as in
Fig. 5.5. The magnetic flux through ÄS is defined as ∆φ  = B.∆S, where B

is the field  at ∆S. We divide S into many small area elements and calculate
the individual flux through each. Then, the net flux φ  is,

where ‘all’ stands for ‘all area elements ∆S′. Compare this with the Gauss’s

where q is the electric charge enclosed by the surface.
The difference between the Gauss’s law of magnetism and that for

electrostatics is a reflection of the fact that isolated magnetic poles (also
called monopoles) are not known to exist. There are no sources or sinks
of B; the simplest magnetic element is a dipole or a current loop. All
magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of an arrangement of
dipoles and/or current loops.
Thus, Gauss’s law for magnetism is:

The net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero.

field lines (thick lines in the figure) wrongly. Point out what is wrong
with them. Some of them may describe electrostatic field lines correctly.
Point out which ones.

FIGURE 5.6 143

Reprint 2025-26

 EXAMPLE 5.3



Physics

Solution
(a) Wrong. Magnetic field lines can never emanate from a point, as

shown in figure. Over any closed surface, the net flux of B must
always be zero, i.e., pictorially as many field lines should seem to
enter the surface as the number of lines leaving it. The field lines
shown, in fact, represent electric field of a long positively charged
wire. The correct magnetic field lines are circling the straight
conductor, as described in Chapter 4.

(b) Wrong. Magnetic field lines (like electric field lines) can never cross
each other, because otherwise the direction of field at the point of
intersection is ambiguous. There is further error in the figure.
Magnetostatic field lines can never form closed loops around empty
space. A closed loop of static magnetic field line must enclose a
region across which a current is passing. By contrast, electrostatic
field lines can never form closed loops, neither in empty space,
nor when the loop encloses charges.

(c) Right. Magnetic lines are completely confined within a toroid.
Nothing wrong here in field lines forming closed loops, since each
loop encloses a region across which a current passes. Note, for
clarity of figure, only a few field lines within the toroid have been
shown. Actually, the entire region enclosed by the windings
contains magnetic field.

(d) Wrong. Field lines due to a solenoid at its ends and outside cannot
be so completely straight and confined; such a thing violates
Ampere’s law. The lines should curve out at both ends, and meet
eventually to form closed loops.

(e) Right. These are field lines outside and inside a bar magnet. Note
carefully the direction of field lines inside. Not all field lines emanate
out of a north pole (or converge into a south pole). Around both
the N-pole, and the S-pole, the net flux of the field is zero.

(f ) Wrong. These field lines cannot possibly represent a magnetic field.
Look at the upper region. All the field lines seem to emanate out of
the shaded plate. The net flux through a surface surrounding the
shaded plate is not zero. This is impossible for a magnetic field.
The given field lines, in fact, show the electrostatic field lines
around a positively charged upper plate and a negatively charged
lower plate. The difference between Fig. [5.6(e) and (f )]  should be
carefully grasped.

(g) Wrong. Magnetic field lines between two pole pieces cannot be
precisely straight at the ends. Some fringing of lines is inevitable.
Otherwise, Ampere’s law is violated. This is also true for electric
field lines.

Example 5.4
(a) Magnetic field lines show the direction (at every point) along which

a small magnetised needle aligns (at the point). Do the magnetic
field lines also represent the lines of force on a moving charged
particle at every point?

(b) If magnetic monopoles existed, how would the Gauss’s law of
magnetism be modified?

(c) Does a bar magnet exert a torque on itself due to its own field?
Does one element of a current-carrying wire exert a force on another
element of the same wire?

(d) Magnetic field arises due to charges in motion. Can a system
have magnetic moments even though its net charge is zero?

Solution
(a) No. The magnetic force is always normal to B (remember magnetic

force = qv × B). It is misleading to call magnetic field lines as lines
of force.

(b) Gauss’s law of magnetism states that the flux of B through any

closed surface is always zero ∫ B.∆s = 0 .

If monopoles existed, the right hand side would be equal to the
monopole (magnetic charge) q  enclosed by S. [Analogous to

m

Gauss’s law of electrostatics, ∫ B.∆s = µ0qm  where q  is the
S m

(monopole) magnetic charge enclosed by S .]
(c) No. There is no force or torque on an element due to the field

produced by that element itself. But there is a force (or torque)
on an element of the same wire. (For the special case of a straight
wire, this force is zero.)

(d) Yes. The average of the charge in the system may be zero. Yet,
the mean of the magnetic moments due to various current loops
may not be zero. We will come across such examples in connection
with paramagnetic material where atoms have net dipole moment
through their net charge is zero.

5.4  MAGNETISATION AND MAGNETIC INTENSITY

The earth abounds with a bewildering variety of elements and compounds.
In addition, we have been synthesising new alloys, compounds and even
elements. One would like to classify the magnetic properties of these
substances. In the present section, we define and explain certain terms
which will help us to carry out this exercise.

We have seen that a circulating electron in an atom has a magnetic
moment. In a bulk material, these moments add up vectorially and they
can give a net magnetic moment which is non-zero. We define
magnetisation M of a sample to be equal to its net magnetic moment per
unit volume:

m
M = net

V

M is a vector with dimensions L–1 A and is measured in a units of A m–1.
Consider a long solenoid of n turns per unit length and carrying a

current I. The magnetic field in the interior of the solenoid was shown to
be given by

B  = µ  nI (5.8)
0 0

If the interior of the solenoid is filled with a material with non-zero
magnetisation, the field inside the solenoid will be greater than B . The

0

B = B  + B (5.9)

where B  is the field contributed by the material core. It turns out that

m
this additional field B  is proportional to the magnetisation M of the

m

material and is expressed as

B  = µ M (5.10)
m 0

where µ  is the same constant (permittivity of vacuum) that appears in
0

Biot-Savart’s law.
It is convenient to introduce another vector field H, called the magnetic

intensity, which is defined by

B
H = – M

µ (5.11)
0

where H has the same dimensions as M and is measured in units of A m–1.
Thus, the total magnetic field B is written as

B = µ  (H + M) (5.12)
0

We repeat our defining procedure. We have partitioned the contribution
to the total magnetic field inside the sample into two parts: one, due to
external factors such as the current in the solenoid. This is represented
by H. The other is due to the specific nature of the magnetic material,
namely M. The latter quantity can be influenced by external factors. This
influence is mathematically expressed as

M = χ H (5.13)

where χ , a dimensionless quantity, is appropriately called the magnetic
susceptibility. It is a measure of how a magnetic material responds to an
external field. χ is small and positive for materials, which are called
paramagnetic. It is small and negative for materials, which are termed
diamagnetic. In the latter case M and H are opposite in direction. From
Eqs. (5.12) and (5.13) we obtain,

B = µ0(1 + χ)H (5.14)

= µ µ H
0 r 

=  µ H (5.15)

where µ = 1 + χ, is a dimensionless quantity called the relative magnetic

electrostatics. The magnetic permeability of the substance is µ and it has
the same dimensions and units as µ ;

0

µ = µ µ  = µ  (1+χ).

The three quantities χ, µ  and µ are interrelated and only one of
r

them is independent. Given one, the other two may be easily determined.

permeability 400. The windings of the solenoid are insulated from the
core and carry a current of 2A. If the number of turns is 1000 per

core. Thus B = µ  n (I + I ). Using I = 2A, B = 1 T, we get I  = 794 A.

5.5 MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS

The discussion in the previous section helps us to classify materials as
diamagnetic, paramagnetic or ferromagnetic. In terms of the susceptibility
χ, a material is diamagnetic if χ is negative, para- if χ is positive and small,
and ferro- if χ is large and positive.

A glance at Table 5.2 gives one a better feeling for these materials.
Here ε is a small positive number introduced to quantify paramagnetic
materials. Next, we describe these materials in some detail.

part in 105. When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend
to move from high to low field. 147

Reprint 2025-26

 EXAMPLE 5.5



Physics
The simplest explanation for diamagnetism is as follows. Electrons in

an atom orbiting around nucleus possess orbital angular momentum.
These orbiting electrons are equivalent to current-carrying loop and thus
possess orbital magnetic moment. Diamagnetic substances are the ones
in which resultant magnetic moment in an atom is zero. When magnetic
field is applied, those electrons having orbital magnetic moment in the
same direction slow down and those in the opposite direction speed up.
This happens due to induced current in accordance with Lenz’s law which
you will study in Chapter 6. Thus, the substance develops a net magnetic
moment in direction opposite to that of the applied field and hence repulsion.

Some diamagnetic materials are bismuth, copper, lead, silicon,
nitrogen (at STP), water and sodium chloride. Diamagnetism is present
in all the substances. However, the effect is so weak in most cases that it
gets shifted by other effects like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, etc.

The most exotic diamagnetic materials are superconductors. These
are metals, cooled to very low temperatures which exhibits both perfect
conductivity and perfect diamagnetism. Here the field lines are completely
expelled!  χ = –1 and µ  = 0. A superconductor repels a magnet and (by

r
Newton’s third law) is repelled by the magnet. The phenomenon of perfect
diamagnetism in superconductors is called the Meissner effect, after the
name of its discoverer. Superconducting magnets can be gainfully
exploited in variety of situations, for example, for running magnetically
levitated superfast trains.

5.5.2  Paramagnetism
Paramagnetic substances are those which get weakly magnetised when
placed in an external magnetic field. They have tendency to move from a
region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get weakly
attracted to a magnet.

The individual atoms (or ions or molecules) of a paramagnetic material
possess a permanent magnetic dipole moment of their own. On account
of the ceaseless random thermal motion of the atoms, no net magnetisation
is seen. In the presence of an external field B , which is strong enough,

0
and at low temperatures, the individual atomic dipole moment can be
made to align and point in the same direction as B . Figure 5.7(b) shows

0
a bar of paramagnetic material placed in an external field. The field lines
gets concentrated inside the material, and the field inside is enhanced. In
most cases, this enhancement is slight, being one part in 105. When placed
in a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from weak field
to strong.

Some paramagnetic materials are aluminium, sodium, calcium,
oxygen (at STP) and copper chloride. For a paramagnetic material both χ
and µ  depend not only on the material, but also (in a simple fashion) on

r
the sample temperature. As the field is increased or the temperature is
lowered, the magnetisation increases until it reaches the saturation value
at which point all the dipoles are perfectly aligned with the field.

5.5.3  Ferromagnetism
Ferromagnetic substances are those which gets strongly magnetised when
placed in an external magnetic field. They have strong tendency to move
from a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get
strongly attracted to a magnet.

The individual atoms (or ions or molecules) in a ferromagnetic material
possess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material. However, they
interact with one another in such a way that they spontaneously align
themselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume called
domain. The explanation of this cooperative effect requires quantum
mechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook. Each domain has a
net magnetisation. Typical domain size is 1mm and the domain contains
about 1011 atoms. In the first instant, the magnetisation varies randomly
from domain to domain and there is no bulk magnetisation. This is shown
in Fig. 5.8(a). When we apply an external magnetic field B , the domains

0 FIGURE 5.8
orient themselves in the direction of B  and simultaneously the domain

oriented in the direction of B  grow in size. This existence of domains and

microscope after sprinkling a liquid suspension of powdered
ferromagnetic substance of samples. This motion of suspension can be
observed. Fig. 5.8(b) shows the situation when the domains have aligned
and amalgamated to form a single ‘giant’ domain.

 Thus, in a ferromagnetic material the field lines are highly
concentrated. In non-uniform magnetic field, the sample tends to move
towards the region of high field. We may wonder as to what happens
when the external field is removed. In some ferromagnetic materials the
magnetisation persists. Such materials are called hard magnetic materials
or hard ferromagnets. Alnico, an alloy of iron, aluminium, nickel, cobalt
and copper, is one such material. The naturally occurring lodestone is
another. Such materials form permanent magnets to be used among other
things as a compass needle. On the other hand, there is a class of
ferromagnetic materials in which the magnetisation disappears on removal
of the external field. Soft iron is one such material. Appropriately enough,
such materials are called soft ferromagnetic materials. There are a number
of elements, which are ferromagnetic: iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium,
etc. The relative magnetic permeability is >1000!

The ferromagnetic property depends on temperature. At high enough
temperature, a ferromagnet becomes a paramagnet. The domain structure
disintegrates with temperature. This disappearance of magnetisation with
temperature is gradual.

POINTS TO PONDER

1. A satisfactory understanding of magnetic phenomenon in terms of moving
charges/currents was arrived at after 1800 AD. But technological
exploitation of the directional properties of magnets predates this scientific
understanding by two thousand years. Thus, scientific understanding is
not a necessary condition for engineering applications. Ideally, science
and engineering go hand-in-hand, one leading and assisting the other in
tandem.

2. Magnetic monopoles do not exist. If you slice a magnet in half, you get
two smaller magnets. On the other hand, isolated positive and negative
charges exist. There exists a smallest unit of charge, for example, the
electronic charge with value |e| = –19

1.6 ×10  C. All other charges are
integral multiples of this smallest unit charge. In other words, charge is
quantised. We do not know why magnetic monopoles do not exist or why
electric charge is quantised.

3. A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is that
the magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast,

ELECTROMAGNETIC
INDUCTION

6.1  INTRODUCTION

Electricity and magnetism were considered separate and unrelated
phenomena for a long time. In the early decades of the nineteenth century,
experiments on electric current by Oersted, Ampere and a few others
established the fact that electricity and magnetism are inter-related. They
found that moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. For example,
an electric current deflects a magnetic compass needle placed in its vicinity.
This naturally raises the questions like: Is the converse effect possible?
Can moving magnets produce electric currents? Does the nature permit
such a relation between electricity and magnetism? The answer is
resounding yes! The experiments of Michael Faraday in England and
Joseph Henry in USA, conducted around 1830, demonstrated
conclusively that electric currents were induced in closed coils when
subjected to changing magnetic fields. In this chapter, we will study the
phenomena associated with changing magnetic fields and understand
the underlying principles. The phenomenon in which electric current is
generated by varying magnetic fields is appropriately called
electromagnetic induction.

When Faraday first made public his discovery that relative motion
between a bar magnet and a wire loop produced a small current in the
latter, he was asked, “What is the use of it?” His reply was: “What is the

is not merely of theoretical or academic interest but also
of practical utility. Imagine a world where there is no
electricity – no electric lights, no trains, no telephones and
no personal computers. The pioneering experiments of
Faraday and Henry have led directly to the development
of modern day generators and transformers. Today’s
civilisation owes its progress to a great extent to the
discovery of electromagnetic induction.

current’s direction. Moreover, when the South-pole of
the bar magnet is moved towards or away from the
coil, the deflections in the galvanometer are opposite
to that observed with the North-pole for similar
movements. Further, the deflection (and hence current)
is found to be larger when the magnet is pushed
towards or pulled away from the coil faster. Instead,
when the bar magnet is held fixed and the coil C  is

effects are observed. It shows that it is the relative
motion between the magnet and the coil that is
responsible for generation (induction) of electric
current in the coil.

It is observed that the galvanometer shows a momentary deflection
when the tapping key K is pressed. The pointer in the galvanometer returns
to zero immediately. If the key is held pressed continuously, there is no
deflection in the galvanometer. When the key is released, a momentory
deflection is observed again, but in the opposite direction. It is also observed
that the deflection increases dramatically when an iron rod is inserted
into the coils along their axis.

6.3  MAGNETIC FLUX

Faraday’s great insight lay in discovering a simple mathematical relation
to explain the series of experiments he carried out on electromagnetic
induction. However, before we state and appreciate his laws, we must get
familiar with the notion of magnetic flux, F . Magnetic flux is defined in

where q   is angle between B and A. The notion of the area as a vector
has been discussed earlier in Chapter 1. Equation (6.1) can be
extended to curved surfaces and nonuniform fields.

If the magnetic field has different magnitudes and directions at
various parts of a surface as shown in Fig. 6.5, then the magnetic
flux through the surface is given by

6.4  FARADAY’S LAW OF INDUCTION

From the experimental observations, Faraday arrived at a
conclusion that an emf is induced in a coil when magnetic flux
through the coil changes with time. Experimental observations
discussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept.

The motion of a magnet towards or away from coil C  in

coil C  (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a
2

maximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic
flux through the neighbouring coil C  also increases. It is the change in

1
magnetic flux through coil C  that produces an induced emf in coil C .

1 1
When the key is held pressed, current in coil C  is constant. Therefore,

2
there is no change in the magnetic flux through coil C  and the current in

coil C  drops to zero. When the key is released, the current in C  and the

1 2
resulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in a
short time. This results in a decrease in magnetic flux through coil C

and hence again induces an electric current in coil C *. The common

1
point in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magnetic
flux through a circuit induces emf in it. Faraday stated experimental
observations in the form of a law called Faraday’s law of electromagnetic
induction. The law is stated below.

* Note that sensitive electrical instruments in the vicinity of an electromagnet
can be damaged due to the induced emfs (and the resulting currents)  when the
electromagnet is turned on or off. 157

Note that the earth’s magnetic field also produces a flux through the

magnetic field. It is rotated about its vertical diameter through 180°

6.5  LENZ’S LAW AND CONSERVATION OF ENERGY

In 1834, German physicist Heinrich Friedrich Lenz (1804-1865) deduced
a rule, known as Lenz’s law which gives the polarity of the induced emf
in a clear and concise fashion. The statement of the law is:

The polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current
which opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.

The negative sign shown in Eq. (6.3) represents this effect. We can
understand Lenz’s law by examining Experiment 6.1 in Section 6.2.1. In
Fig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed
towards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards
the coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases. Hence current is
induced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux.
This is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter-clockwise
direction with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet.
Note that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity
towards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the North-
pole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux
through the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux,
the induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-
pole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in
an attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the
corresponding decrease in flux.

What will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loop
in the above example? In this case too, an emf is induced across the open

ends of the circuit. The direction of the induced emf can be found
using Lenz’s law. Consider Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b). They provide an easier
way to understand the direction of induced currents. Note that the

direction shown by  and  indicate the directions of the induced

currents.
A little reflection on this matter should convince us on the

correctness of Lenz’s law. Suppose that the induced current was in
the direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig. 6.6(a). In that case,
the South-pole due to the induced current will face the approaching
North-pole of the magnet. The bar magnet will then be attracted
towards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration. A gentle push on
the magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energy
will continuously increase without expending any energy. If this can
happen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by a
suitable arrangement. This violates the law of conservation of energy
and hence can not happen.

Solution
(i) The magnetic flux through the rectangular loop abcd increases,

due to the motion of the loop into the region of magnetic field, The
induced current must flow along the path bcdab so that it opposes
the increasing flux.

(ii) Due to the outward motion, magnetic flux through the triangular
loop abc decreases due to which the induced current flows along
bacb, so as to oppose the change in flux.

(iii) As the magnetic flux decreases due to motion of the irregular
shaped loop abcd out of the region of magnetic field, the induced
current flows along cdabc, so as to oppose change in flux.
Note that there are no induced current as long as the loops are
completely inside or outside the region of the magnetic field.

6.6  MOTIONAL ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE

Let us consider a straight conductor moving in a uniform and time-
independent magnetic field.  Figure 6.10 shows a rectangular conductor
PQRS in which the conductor PQ is free to move. The rod PQ is moved

towards the left with a constant velocity v as
shown in the figure. Assume that there is no
loss of energy due to friction. PQRS forms a
closed circuit enclosing an area that changes
as PQ moves. It is placed in a uniform magnetic
field B which is perpendicular to the plane of
this system. If the length RQ = x and RS = l, the
magnetic flux F enclosed  by the loop PQRS

F  = Blx

Since x is changing with time, the rate of change
of flux F will induce an emf given by:

Electromagnetic
Induction

where we have used dx/dt = –v  which is the speed of the conductor PQ.
The induced emf Blv is called motional emf. Thus, we are able to produce
induced emf by moving a conductor instead of varying the magnetic field,
that is, by changing the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit.

It is also possible to explain the motional emf expression in Eq. (6.5)
by invoking the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of conductor
PQ. Consider any arbitrary charge q in the conductor PQ. When the rod
moves with speed v, the charge will also be moving with speed v in the
magnetic field B. The Lorentz force on this charge is qvB in magnitude,
and its direction is towards Q. All charges experience the same force, in
magnitude and direction, irrespective of their position in the rod PQ.
The work done in moving the charge from P to Q is,

W = qvBl

Since emf is the work done per unit charge,

ε = W
q

    = Blv

This equation gives emf induced across the rod PQ and is identical
to Eq. (6.5). We stress that our presentation is not wholly rigorous. But
it does help us to understand the basis of Faraday’s law when
the conductor is moving in a uniform and time-independent
magnetic field.

On the other hand, it is not obvious how an emf is induced when a
conductor is stationary and the magnetic field is changing – a fact which
Faraday verified by numerous experiments. In the case of a stationary
conductor, the force on its charges is given by

F = q (E + v ´ B) = qE (6.6)

since v = 0. Thus, any force on the charge must arise from the electric
field term E alone. Therefore, to explain the existence of induced emf or
induced current, we must assume that a time-varying magnetic field
generates an electric field. However, we hasten to add that electric fields
produced by static electric charges have properties different from those
produced by time-varying magnetic fields. In Chapter 4, we learnt that
charges in motion (current) can exert force/torque on a stationary magnet.
Conversely, a bar magnet in motion (or more generally, a changing
magnetic field) can exert a force on the stationary charge. This is the
fundamental significance of the Faraday’s discovery. Electricity and
magnetism are related.

of 50 rev/s, with one end hinged at the centre and the other end at the
circumference of a circular metallic ring of radius 1 m, about an axis
passing through the centre and perpendicular to the plane of the ring

 EXAMPLE 6.6



Physics

FIGURE 6.11
Solution
Method I
As the rod is rotated, free electrons in the rod move towards the outer
end due to Lorentz force and get distributed over the ring. Thus, the
resulting separation of charges produces an emf across the ends of
the rod. At a certain value of emf, there is no more flow of electrons
and a steady state is reached. Using Eq. (6.5), the magnitude of the
emf generated across a length dr of the rod as it moves at right angles
to the magnetic field is given by

dε = Bv dr . Hence,

Method II
To calculate the emf, we can imagine a closed loop OPQ in which
point O and P are connected with a resistor R and OQ is the rotating
rod. The potential difference across the resistor is then equal to the
induced emf and equals B × (rate of change of area of loop). If q is the
angle between the rod and the radius of the circle at P at time t, the
area of the sector OPQ is given by

π 2 × θ 1
R = R2θ

with all the turns. When the flux Φ  through the coil changes, each turn

B
contributes to the induced emf. Therefore, a term called flux linkage is
used which is equal to NΦ  for a closely wound coil and in such a case

B

B ∝  I

The constant of proportionality, in this relation, is called inductance.
We shall see that inductance depends only on the geometry of the coil
and intrinsic material properties. This aspect is akin to capacitance which
for a parallel plate capacitor depends on the plate area and plate separation
(geometry) and the dielectric constant K of the intervening medium
(intrinsic material property).

Inductance is a scalar quantity. It has the dimensions of [M L2 T–2 A–2]
given by the dimensions of flux divided by the dimensions of current. The
SI unit of inductance is henry and is denoted by H. It is named in honour
of Joseph Henry who discovered electromagnetic induction in USA,
independently of Faraday in England.

We have demonstrated this equality for long co-axial solenoids.
However, the relation is far more general. Note that if the inner solenoid
was much shorter than (and placed well inside) the outer solenoid, then
we could still have calculated the flux linkage N Φ  because the inner

1 1
solenoid is effectively immersed in a uniform magnetic field due to the
outer solenoid. In this case, the calculation of M  would be easy. However,

12
it would be extremely difficult to calculate the flux linkage with the outer
solenoid as the magnetic field due to the inner solenoid would vary across
the length as well as cross section of the outer solenoid. Therefore, the
calculation of M  would also be extremely difficult in this case. The

solenoids. Instead, if a medium of relative permeability µ  had been present,

It is also important to know that the mutual inductance of a pair of

It shows that varying current in a coil can induce emf in a neighbouring

coil. The magnitude of the induced emf depends upon the rate of change
of current and mutual inductance of the two coils.

6.7.2  Self-inductance

In the previous sub-section, we considered the flux in one solenoid due
to the current in the other.  It is also possible that emf is induced in a
single isolated coil due to change of flux through the coil by means of
varying the current through the same coil. This phenomenon is called
self-induction. In this case, flux linkage through a coil of N turns is
proportional to the current through the coil and is expressed as

NΦ ∝ I
B

NΦ = L I (6.13)
B

where constant of proportionality L is called self-inductance of the coil. It
is also called the coefficient of self-induction of the coil. When the current
is varied, the flux linked with the coil also changes and an emf is induced
in the coil. Using Eq. (6.13), the induced emf is given by

d (NΦ
ε = B )

–
dt

ε = dI
–L (6.14)

Thus, the self-induced emf always opposes any change  (increase or
decrease) of current in the coil.

It is possible to calculate the self-inductance for circuits with simple
geometries. Let us calculate the self-inductance of a long solenoid of cross-
sectional area A and length l, having n turns per unit length. The magnetic
field due to a current I flowing in the solenoid is B = µ  n I  (neglecting edge

effects, as before). The total flux linked with the solenoid is

NΦ = (nl )(µ n I )(AB 0 )

where nl is the total number of turns. Thus, the self-inductance is,

permeability of the medium.

the role of inertia. It is the electromagnetic analogue of mass in mechanics.
So, work needs to be done against the back emf (ε ) in establishing the
current. This work done is stored as magnetic potential energy. For the
current I at an instant in a circuit, the rate of work done is

dW = ε I

If we ignore the resistive losses and consider only inductive effect,
then using Eq. (6.14),

which exist independently. Equation (6.7) would be modified into

6.8  AC GENERATOR

The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction
has been technologically exploited in many ways.
An exceptionally important application is the
generation of alternating currents (ac). The
modern ac generator with a typical output
capacity of 100 MW is a highly evolved machine.
In this section, we shall describe the basic
principles behind this machine. The Yugoslav
inventor Nicola Tesla is credited with the
development of the machine. As was pointed out
in Section 6.3, one method to induce an emf or
current in a loop is through a change in the
loop’s orientation or a change in its effective area.
As the coil rotates in a magnetic field B, the
effective area of the loop (the face perpendicular
to the field) is A cos q, where q is the angle
between A and B. This method of producing a

simple ac generator. An ac generator converts mechanical energy into
electrical energy.

The basic elements of an ac generator are shown in Fig. 6.13. It consists
of a coil mounted on a rotor shaft. The axis of rotation of the coil is
perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The coil (called
armature) is mechanically rotated in the  uniform magnetic field by some
external means. The rotation of the coil causes the magnetic flux through
it to change, so an emf is induced in the coil. The ends of the
coil are connected to an external circuit by means of slip rings
and brushes.

When the coil is rotated with a constant angular speed w, the angle q
between the magnetic field vector B and the area vector A of the coil at any
instant t is q  = wt (assuming q = 0° at t = 0). As a result, the effective area
of the coil exposed to the magnetic field lines changes with time, and from
Eq. (6.1), the flux at any time t is

F  = BA cos q = BA cos wt
B

From Faraday’s law, the induced emf for the rotating coil of N turns
is then,

ε = dΦ d
– N B = – NBA (cosω t )

dt dt
Thus, the instantaneous value of the emf is
ε = NBA ω sin ωt (6.19)

where NBAw is the maximum value of the emf, which occurs when
sin wt = ±1. If we denote NBAw as e , then

0

e = e  sin wt (6.20)
0

Since the value of the sine fuction varies between +1 and –1, the sign, or
polarity of the emf changes with time. Note from Fig. 6.14 that the emf
has its extremum value when q = 90° or q = 270°, as the change of flux is
greatest at these points.

The direction of the current changes periodically and therefore the current
is called alternating current (ac). Since w = 2pn, Eq (6.20) can be written as

e = e sin 2p n t (6.21)
0

where n is the frequency of revolution of the generator’s coil.
Note that Eq. (6.20) and (6.21) give the instantaneous value of the emf

and e varies between +e  and –e  periodically. We shall learn how to
0 0

determine the time-averaged value for the alternating voltage and current
in the next chapter.

In commercial generators, the mechanical energy required for
rotation of the armature is provided by water falling from a height, for
example, from dams. These are called hydro-electric generators.
Alternatively, water is heated to produce steam using coal or other
sources. The steam at high pressure produces the rotation of the
armature. These are called thermal generators. Instead of coal, if a
nuclear fuel is used, we get nuclear power generators. Modern day
generators produce electric power as high as 500 MW, i.e., one can light

stationary and it is the electromagnets which are rotated. The frequency
of rotation is 50 Hz in India. In certain countries such as USA, it is
60 Hz.

Example 6.10 Kamla peddles a stationary bicycle. The pedals of the
bicycle are attached to a 100 turn coil of area 0.10 m2. The coil rotates
at half a revolution per second and it is placed in a uniform magnetic
field of 0.01 T perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the coil. What is
the maximum voltage generated in the coil?

Solution  Here n = 0.5 Hz; N =100, A = 0.1 m2 and B = 0.01 T. Employing
Eq. (6.19)

e  = NBA (2 p n)
0

   = 100 × 0.01 × 0.1 × 2 × 3.14 × 0.5

   = 0.314 V

The maximum voltage is 0.314 V.

We urge you to explore such alternative possibilities for power
generation.

SUMMARY

1. The magnetic flux through a surface of area A placed in a uniform magnetic
field B is defined as,

F  = B.A = BA cos q
B

where q is the angle between B and A.
2. Faraday’s laws of induction imply that the emf induced in a coil of N

turns is directly related to the rate of change of flux through it,

ε dΦ
= −N B

dt
Here F  is the flux linked with one turn of the coil. If the circuit is

B
closed, a current I = e/R is set up in it, where R is the resistance of the
circuit.

3. Lenz’s law states that the polarity of the induced emf is such that it
tends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux
that produces it. The negative sign in the expression for Faraday’s law
indicates this fact.

4. When a metal rod of length l is placed normal to a uniform magnetic
field B and moved with a velocity v perpendicular to the field, the
induced emf (called motional emf) across its ends is

e = Bl v

5. Inductance is the ratio of the flux-linkage to current. It is equal to NF/I.
6. A changing current in a coil (coil 2) can induce an emf in a nearby coil

(coil 1). This relation is given by,

ε dI
= −M 2

1 12
dt

The quantity M is called mutual inductance of coil 1 with respect to
12 

coil 2. One can similarly define M . There exists a general equality,
21

M  = M
12 21

7. When a current in a coil changes, it induces a back emf in the same
coil. The self-induced emf is given by,

ε dI
= −L

dt
L is the self-inductance of the coil. It is a measure of the inertia of the
coil against the change of current through it.

8. The self-inductance of a long solenoid, the core of which consists of a
magnetic material of relative permeability m , is given by

r

L = m m n2 Al
r  0 

where A is the area of cross-section of the solenoid, l its length and n
the number of turns per unit length.

9. In an ac generator, mechanical energy is converted to electrical energy
by virtue of electromagnetic induction. If coil of N turn and area A is
rotated at n revolutions per second in a uniform magnetic field B, then
the motional emf produced is

e = NBA (2pn) sin (2pnt)

where we have assumed that at time t = 0 s, the coil is perpendicular to
the field.

POINTS TO PONDER

1. Electricity and magnetism are intimately related. In the early part of the
nineteenth century, the experiments of Oersted, Ampere and others
established that moving charges (currents) produce a magnetic field.
Somewhat later, around 1830, the experiments of Faraday and Henry
demonstrated that a moving magnet can induce electric current.

2. In a closed circuit, electric currents are induced so as to oppose the
changing magnetic flux. It is as per the law of conservation of energy.
However, in case of an open circuit, an emf is induced across its ends.
How is it related to the flux change?

3. The motional emf discussed in Section 6.5 can be argued independently
from Faraday’s law using the Lorentz force on moving charges. However,
even if the charges are stationary [and the q (v × B) term of the Lorentz
force is not operative], an emf is nevertheless induced in the presence of a
time-varying magnetic field. Thus, moving charges in static field and static
charges in a time-varying field seem to be symmetric situation for Faraday’s
law. This gives a tantalising hint on the relevance of the principle of
relativity for Faraday’s law.

ALTERNATING
CURRENT

7.1  INTRODUCTION

We have so far considered direct current (dc) sources and circuits with dc
sources. These currents do not change direction with time. But voltages
and currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mains
supply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function
with time. Such a voltage is called alternating voltage (ac voltage) and
the current driven by it in a circuit is called the alternating current (ac
current)*. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage.
This is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power
companies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current. The main
reason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages
can be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by
means of transformers. Further, electrical energy can also be transmitted
economically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics which
are exploited in many devices of daily use. For example, whenever we
tune our radio to a favourite station, we are taking advantage of a special
property of ac circuits – one of many that you will study in this chapter.

* The phrases ac voltage and ac current are contradictory and redundant,
respectively, since they mean, literally, alternating current voltage and alternating
current current. Still, the abbreviation ac to designate an electrical quantity
displaying simple harmonic time dependance has become so universally accepted
that we follow others in its use. Further, voltage – another phrase commonly
used means potential difference between two points.

7.3 REPRESENTATION OF AC CURRENT AND VOLTAGE

BY ROTATING VECTORS — PHASORS

In the previous section, we learnt that the current through  a resistor is
in phase with the ac voltage. But this is not so in the case  of an inductor,
a capacitor or a combination  of these circuit elements. In order to show
phase relationship between voltage and current
in an ac circuit, we use the notion of phasors.
The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the
use of a phasor diagram. A phasor* is a vector
which rotates about the origin with angular
speed w, as shown in Fig. 7.4. The vertical
components of phasors V and I represent the
sinusoidally varying quantities v and i. The
magnitudes of phasors V and I represent  the
amplitudes or the peak values v  and i  of these

m m
oscillating quantities. Figure 7.4(a) shows the FIGURE 7.4 (a) A phasor diagram for the
voltage and current phasors and their circuit in Fig 7.1. (b) Graph of v and

connected to a resistor i.e., corresponding to the
circuit shown in Fig. 7.1. The projection of
voltage and current phasors on vertical axis, i.e., v  sinw t and i  sinw t,

m m
respectively represent the value of voltage and current at that instant. As
they rotate with frequency w, curves in Fig. 7.4(b) are generated.
From Fig. 7.4(a) we see that phasors V and I for the case of a resistor are
in the same direction. This is so for all times. This means that the phase
angle between the voltage and the current is zero.

7.4  AC VOLTAGE APPLIED TO AN INDUCTOR

Figure 7.5 shows an ac source connected to an inductor. Usually,
inductors have appreciable resistance in their windings, but we shall
assume that this inductor has negligible resistance.
Thus, the circuit is a purely inductive ac circuit. Let
the voltage across the source be v = v  sinw t. Using

is no resistor in the circuit,

* Though voltage and current in ac circuit are represented by phasors – rotating
vectors, they are not vectors themselves. They are scalar quantities. It so happens
that the amplitudes and phases of harmonically varying scalars combine
mathematically in the same way as do the projections of rotating vectors of
corresponding magnitudes and directions. The rotating vectors that represent
harmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide us with a
simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that we already know. 181

Equation (7.11) implies that the equation for i(t), the current as a

function of time, must be such that its slope di/dt is a sinusoidally varying
quantity, with the same phase as the source voltage and an amplitude
given by v /L. To obtain the current, we integrate di/dt with respect to

The integration constant has the dimension of current and is time-

independent. Since the source has an emf which oscillates symmetrically
about zero, the current it sustains also oscillates symmetrically about
zero, so that no constant or time-independent component of the current
exists. Therefore, the integration constant is zero.

The dimension of inductive reactance is the same as that of resistance

proportional to the inductance and to the frequency of the current.

A comparison of Eqs. (7.1) and (7.12) for the source voltage and the
current in an inductor shows that the current lags the voltage by p/2 or
one-quarter (1/4) cycle. Figure 7.6 (a) shows the voltage and the current

When a capacitor is connected to a voltage source

in a dc circuit, current will flow for the short time
required to charge the capacitor. As charge
accumulates on the capacitor plates, the voltage
across them increases, opposing the current. That is,
a capacitor in a dc circuit will limit or oppose the
current as it charges. When the capacitor is fully
charged, the current in the circuit falls to zero.

When the capacitor is connected to an ac source,
as in Fig. 7.7, it limits or regulates the current, but

The dimension of capacitive reactance is the
same as that of resistance and its SI unit is
ohm (Ω). The capacitive reactance limits the
amplitude of the current in a purely capacitive
circuit in the same way as the resistance limits
the current in a purely resistive circuit. But it
is inversely proportional to the frequency and
the capacitance.

A comparison of Eq. (7.16) with the

Example 7.3 A lamp is connected in series with a capacitor. Predict
your observations for dc and ac connections. What happens in each
case if the capacitance of the capacitor is reduced?
Solution When a dc source is connected to a capacitor, the capacitor
gets charged and after charging no current flows in the circuit and
the lamp will not glow. There will be no change even if C is reduced.
With ac source, the capacitor offers capacitative reactance (1/ωC )
and the current flows in the circuit. Consequently, the lamp will shine.
Reducing C will increase reactance and the lamp will shine less brightly
than before.

This current oscillates between +1.47A and –1.47 A, and is ahead of

If the frequency is doubled, the capacitive reactance is halved and
consequently, the current is doubled.

The switch is closed and after sometime, an iron rod is inserted into
the interior of the inductor. The glow of the light bulb (a) increases; (b)
decreases; (c) is unchanged, as the iron rod is inserted. Give your
answer with reasons.

Solution  As the iron rod is inserted, the magnetic field inside the coil
magnetizes the iron increasing the magnetic field inside it. Hence,
the inductance of the coil increases. Consequently, the inductive
reactance of the coil increases. As a result, a larger fraction of the
applied ac voltage appears across the inductor, leaving less voltage
across the bulb. Therefore, the glow of the light bulb decreases.

7.6.1  Phasor-diagram solution
From the circuit shown in Fig. 7.10, we see that the resistor, inductor

the same at any time, having the same amplitude and phase. Let it be

i = i  sin(wt+f ) (7.21)
m

where f is the phase difference between the voltage across the source and
the current in the circuit. On the basis of what we have learnt in the previous
sections, we shall construct a phasor diagram for the present case.

Let I be the phasor representing the current in the circuit as given by
Eq. (7.21). Further, let V , V , V , and V represent the voltage across the

7.6.2  Resonance

An interesting characteristic of the series RLC circuit is the phenomenon
of resonance. The phenomenon of resonance is common among systems
that have a tendency to oscillate at a particular frequency. This frequency
is called the system’s natural frequency. If such a system is driven by an
energy source at a frequency that is near the natural frequency, the
amplitude of oscillation is found to be large. A familiar example of this
phenomenon is a child on a swing. The swing has a natural frequency

188
for swinging back and forth like a pendulum. If the child pulls on the

rope at regular intervals and the frequency of the pulls is almost the
same as the frequency of swinging, the amplitude of the swinging will
be large.

For an RLC circuit driven with voltage of amplitude v  and frequency

v

v / R at resonance, the current amplitude for
m 

case (i) is twice to that for case (ii).
Resonant circuits have a variety of applications, for example, in the

tuning  mechanism of a radio or a TV set. The antenna of a radio accepts
signals from many broadcasting stations. The signals picked up in the
antenna acts as a source in the tuning circuit of the radio, so the circuit
can be driven at many frequencies. But to hear one particular radio
station, we tune the radio. In tuning, we vary the capacitance of a
capacitor in the tuning circuit such that the resonant frequency of the
circuit becomes nearly equal to the frequency of the radio signal received.
When this happens, the amplitude of the current with the frequency of
the signal of the particular radio station in the circuit is maximum.

It is important to note that resonance phenomenon is exhibited by a
circuit only if both L and C are present in the circuit. Only then do the
voltages across L and C cancel each other (both being out of phase)
and the current amplitude is v /R, the total source voltage appearing

across R. This means that we cannot have resonance in a RL or
RC circuit. 189

Example 7.6 A resistor of 200 W and a capacitor of 15.0 mF are
connected in series to a 220 V, 50 Hz ac source. (a) Calculate the
current in the circuit; (b) Calculate the voltage (rms) across the
resistor and the capacitor. Is the algebraic sum of these voltages
more than the source voltage? If yes, resolve the paradox.

Solution

Given

R = 200Ω, C = 15.0µF = 15.0 ×10−6 F

V = 220 V, ν = 50Hz

(a) In order to calculate the current, we need the impedance of
the circuit. It is

Z = R2 + X 2 2
C = R + (2π νC)−2

   = (200Ω)2 + (2 × 3.14 × 50 ×15.0 ×10−6 )−2
F

   = (200Ω)2 + (212.3Ω)2

   = 291.67 Ω
Therefore, the current in the circuit is

V
I = = 220V = 0.755 A

Z 291.5 Ω
(b) Since the current is the same throughout the circuit, we have

VR = I R = (0.755 A)(200 Ω) = 151V

VC = I XC = (0.755 A)(212.3 Ω) = 160.3 V

The algebraic sum of the two voltages, V  and V  is 311.3 V which
R C

is more than the source voltage of 220 V. How to resolve this
paradox? As you have learnt in the text, the two voltages are not
in the same phase. Therefore, they cannot be added like ordinary
numbers. The two voltages are out of phase by ninety degrees.
Therefore, the total of these voltages must be obtained using the
Pythagorean theorem:

V 2 2
R+C = VR + VC

= 220 V
Thus, if the phase difference between two voltages is properly taken
into account, the total voltage across the resistor and the capacitor
is equal to the voltage of the source.

The average power over a cycle is given by the average of the two terms in

Its average is zero (the positive half of the cosine cancels the negative
half). Therefore,

This can also be written as,

P = I 2 Z cosφ [7.30(b)]

So, the average power dissipated depends not only on the voltage and
current but also on the cosine of the phase angle φ between them. The
quantity cosφ is called the power factor. Let us discuss the following
cases:

Case (i) Resistive circuit: If the circuit contains only pure R, it is called
resistive. In that case φ = 0, cos φ = 1. There is maximum power dissipation.

Case (ii) Purely inductive or capacitive circuit: If the circuit contains
only an inductor or capacitor, we know that the phase difference between
voltage and current is π/2. Therefore, cos φ = 0, and no power is dissipated
even though a current is flowing in the circuit. This current is sometimes
referred to as wattless current.

Case (iii) LCR series circuit: In an LCR series circuit, power dissipated is
given by Eq. (7.30) where φ = tan–1 (Xc – X

 L )/ R. So,  φ may be non-zero  in
 

a RL or RC or RCL circuit. Even in such cases, power is dissipated only in
the resistor.

Case (iv) Power dissipated at resonance in LCR circuit: At resonance
Xc – XL= 0, and φ = 0. Therefore, cosφ = 1 and P = I 2Z = I2 R. That is,
maximum power is dissipated in a circuit (through R) at resonance.

Example 7.7 (a) For circuits used for transporting electric power, a
low power factor implies large power loss in transmission. Explain.

(b) Power factor can often be improved by the use of a capacitor of
appropriate capacitance in the circuit. Explain.

Solution (a) We know that P = I V cosφ where cosφ is the power factor.
To supply a given power at a given voltage, if cosφ is small, we have to
increase current accordingly. But this will lead to large power loss
(I2R) in transmission.

(b)Suppose in a circuit, current I lags the voltage by an angle φ. Then
power factor cosφ =R/Z.

We can improve the power factor (tending to 1) by making Z tend to
R. Let us understand, with the help of a phasor diagram (Fig. 7.15) 191

Example 7.10 At an airport, a person is made to walk through the
doorway of a metal detector, for security reasons. If she/he is carrying
anything made of metal, the metal detector emits a sound. On what
principle does this detector work?

Solution  The metal detector works on the principle of resonance in
ac circuits. When you walk through a metal detector, you are,
in fact, walking through a coil of many turns. The coil is connected to
a capacitor tuned so that the circuit is in resonance. When
you walk through with metal in your pocket, the impedance of the
circuit changes – resulting in significant change in current in the
circuit. This change in current is detected and the electronic circuitry
causes a sound to be emitted as an alarm. 193

7.8  TRANSFORMERS

For many purposes, it is necessary to change (or transform) an alternating
voltage from one to another of greater or smaller value. This is done with
a device called transformer using the principle of mutual induction.

A transformer consists of two sets of coils, insulated from each other.
They are wound on a soft-iron core, either one on top of the other as in
Fig. 7.16(a) or on separate limbs of the core as in Fig. 7.16(b). One of the
coils called the primary coil has N  turns. The other coil is called the

p

secondary coil; it has N  turns. Often the primary coil is the input coil
s

and the secondary coil is the output coil of the transformer.

FIGURE 7.16 Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer:
(a) two coils on top of each other, (b) two coils on separate limbs of the core.

When an alternating voltage is applied to the  primary, the resulting
current produces an alternating magnetic flux which links the secondary
and induces an emf in it. The value of this emf depends on the number of
turns in the secondary. We consider an ideal transformer in which the
primary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links both
primary and secondary windings. Let f be the flux in each turn in the core
at time t due to current in the primary when a voltage v  is applied to it.

p
Then the induced emf or voltage e , in the secondary with N  turns is

The alternating flux f also induces an emf, called back emf in the

primary. This is

But e  = v . If this were not so, the primary current would be infinite

since the  primary has zero resistance (as assumed). If the secondary is
an open circuit or the current taken from it is small, then to a good
approximation

where  v  is the voltage across the secondary. Therefore, Eqs. (7.31) and

(7.32) can be written as

vp = −N p [7.32(a)]

From Eqs. [7.31 (a)] and [7.32 (a)], we have

Note that the above relation has been obtained using three
assumptions: (i) the primary resistance and current are small; (ii) the
same flux links both the primary and the secondary as very little flux
escapes from the core, and (iii) the secondary current is small.

If the transformer is assumed to be 100% efficient (no energy losses),
the power input is equal to the power output, and since p = i v,

i v  = i v (7.34)
p p s s

Although some energy is always lost, this is a good approximation,
since a well designed transformer may have an efficiency of more than
95%. Combining Eqs. (7.33) and (7.34), we have

ip vs N
= = s

is vp N (7.35)
p

Since i and v both oscillate with the same frequency as the ac source,
Eq. (7.35) also gives the ratio of the amplitudes or rms values of
corresponding quantities.

Now, we can see how a transformer affects the voltage and current.
We have:

 N   N
= s p 

Vs   Vp    and  Is = I
 N p    p (7.36)

N s

That is, if the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the
primary (N  > N ), the voltage is stepped up (V  > V ). This type of

s p s p
arrangement is called a step-up transformer. However, in this arrangement,
there is less current in the secondary than in the primary (N /N  < 1 and I

p s s
< I ). For example, if the primary coil of a transformer has 100 turns and

p
the secondary has 200 turns,  N /N  = 2 and N /N =1/2. Thus, a 220V

s p p s
input at 10A will step-up to 440 V output at 5.0 A.

If the secondary coil has less turns than the primary (N  < N ),
s p

we have a step-down transformer. In this case, V  < V  and I  > I . That
s p s p

is, the voltage is stepped down, or reduced, and the current
is increased.

The equations obtained above apply to ideal transformers (without
any energy losses). But in actual transformers, small energy losses do
occur due to the following reasons:
(i) Flux Leakage: There is always some flux leakage; that is, not all of

the flux due to primary passes through the secondary due to poor 195

Physics
design of the core or the air gaps in the core. It can be reduced by
winding the primary and secondary coils one over the other.

(ii) Resistance of the windings: The wire used for the windings has some
resistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire
(I 2R). In high current, low voltage windings, these are minimised by
using thick wire.

(iii) Eddy currents: The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents
in the iron core and causes heating. The effect is reduced by using a
laminated core.

(iv) Hysteresis: The magnetisation of the core is repeatedly reversed by
the alternating magnetic field. The resulting expenditure of energy in
the core appears as heat and is kept to a minimum by using a magnetic
material which has a low hysteresis loss.
The large scale transmission and distribution of electrical energy over

long distances is done with the use of transformers. The voltage output
of the generator is stepped-up (so that current is reduced and
consequently, the I 2R loss is cut down). It is then transmitted over long
distances to an area sub-station near the consumers. There the voltage
is stepped down. It is further stepped down at distributing sub-stations
and utility poles before a power supply of 240 V reaches our homes.

SUMMARY

1. An alternating voltage v = v sin ω t  applied to a resistor R drives a
m

v
current i = i  sinwt in the resistor, i = m

m . The current is in phase with
m R

the applied voltage.

2. For an alternating current i = i  sin wt passing through a resistor R, the
m

average power loss P (averaged over a cycle) due to joule heating is
( 1/2 )i2 R. To express it in the same form as the dc power (P = I 2R), a

m
special value of current is used. It is called root mean square (rms)
current and is donoted by I:

i
I = m = 0.707 im

2
Similarly, the rms voltage is defined by

v
V = m = 0.707vm

We have P = IV = I2R

3. An ac voltage v = v  sin wt applied to a pure inductor L, drives a current
m

in the inductor i = i  sin (wt – p/2), where i  = v /X . X  = wL is called
m m m L L

inductive reactance. The current in the inductor lags the voltage by
p/2. The average power supplied to an inductor over one complete cycle
is zero.

The term cosf is called the power factor.

6. In a purely inductive or capacitive circuit, cosf = 0 and no power is
dissipated even though a current is flowing in the circuit. In such cases,
current is referred to as a wattless current.

7. The phase relationship between current and voltage in an ac circuit
can be shown conveniently by representing voltage and current by
rotating vectors called phasors. A phasor is a vector which rotates
about the origin with angular speed w. The magnitude of a phasor
represents the amplitude or peak value of the quantity (voltage or
current) represented by the phasor.

The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasor
diagram.

8. A transformer consists of an iron core on which are bound a primary
coil of N  turns and a secondary coil of N  turns. If the primary coil is

p s
connected to an ac source, the primary and secondary voltages are
related by

 N 
V = s

s   Vp
 N p 

and the currents are related by

 Np 

s

If the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the primary, the
voltage is stepped-up (V  > V ). This type of arrangement is called a step-

s p
up transformer. If the secondary coil has turns less than the primary, we
have a step-down transformer.

POINTS TO PONDER

1. When a value is given for ac voltage or current, it is ordinarily the rms
value. The voltage across the terminals of an outlet in your room is
normally 240 V. This refers to the rms value of the voltage. The amplitude
of this voltage is

vm = 2V = 2(240) = 340V

2. The power rating of an element used in ac circuits refers to its average
power rating.

3. The power consumed in an ac circuit is never negative.

4. Both alternating current and direct current are measured in amperes.
But how is the ampere defined for an alternating current? It cannot be
derived from the mutual attraction of two parallel wires carrying ac

198 currents, as the dc ampere is derived. An ac current changes direction

Reprint 2025-26



Alternating Current

with the source frequency and the attractive force would average to
zero. Thus, the ac ampere must be defined in terms of some property
that is independent of the direction of the current. Joule heating
is such a property, and there is one ampere of rms value of
alternating current in a circuit if the current produces the same
average heating effect as one ampere of dc current would produce
under the same conditions.

5. In an ac circuit, while adding voltages across different elements, one
should take care of their phases properly. For example, if V  and V

R C

are voltages across R and C, respectively in an RC circuit, then the

total voltage across RC combination is V = V 2 + V 2  and not
RC R C

V  + V  since V  is p/2 out of phase of V .
R C C R

6. Though in a phasor diagram, voltage and current are represented by
vectors, these quantities are not really vectors themselves. They are
scalar quantities. It so happens that the amplitudes and phases of
harmonically varying scalars combine mathematically in the same
way as do the projections of rotating vectors of corresponding
magnitudes and directions. The ‘rotating vectors’ that represent
harmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide
us with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that
we already know as the law of vector addition.

7. There are no power losses associated with pure capacitances and pure
inductances in an ac circuit. The only element that dissipates energy
in an ac circuit is the resistive element.

8. In a RLC circuit, resonance phenomenon occur when X  = X  or
L C

ω 1
0 = . For resonance to occur, the presence of both L and C

LC
elements in the circuit is a must. With only one of these (L or C )
elements, there is no possibility of voltage cancellation and hence,
no resonance is possible.

9. The power factor in a RLC circuit is a measure of how close the
circuit is to expending the maximum power.

10. In generators and motors, the roles of input and output are
reversed. In a motor, electric energy is the input and mechanical
energy is the output. In a generator, mechanical energy is the
input and electric energy is the output. Both devices simply
transform energy from one form to another.

11. A transformer (step-up) changes a low-voltage into a high-voltage.
This does not violate the law of conservation of energy. The
current is reduced by the same proportion.

8.1  INTRODUCTION

In Chapter 4, we learnt that an electric current produces magnetic field
and that two current-carrying wires exert a magnetic force on each other.
Further, in Chapter 6, we have seen that a magnetic field changing with
time gives rise to an electric field. Is the converse also true? Does an
electric field changing with time give rise to a magnetic field? James Clerk
Maxwell (1831-1879), argued that this was indeed the case – not only
an electric current but also a time-varying electric field generates magnetic
field. While applying the Ampere’s circuital law to find magnetic field at a
point outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell
noticed an inconsistency in the Ampere’s circuital law. He suggested the
existence of an additional current, called by him, the displacement
current to remove this inconsistency.

Maxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magnetic
fields, and their sources, the charge and current densities. These
equations are known as Maxwell’s equations. Together with the Lorentz
force formula (Chapter 4), they mathematically express all the basic laws
of electromagnetism.

The most important prediction to emerge from Maxwell’s equations
is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are (coupled) time-
varying electric and magnetic fields that propagate in space. The speed
of the waves,  according to these equations, turned out to be very close to

the speed of light( 3 ×108 m/s), obtained from optical
measurements. This led to the remarkable conclusion
that light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell’s work
thus unified the domain of electricity, magnetism and
light. Hertz, in 1885, experimentally demonstrated the
existence of electromagnetic waves. Its technological use
by Marconi and others led in due course to the
revolution in communication that we are witnessing
today.

In this chapter, we first discuss the need for
displacement current and its consequences. Then we
present a descriptive account of electromagnetic waves.

Now, consider a different surface, which has the same boundary. This
is a pot like surface [Fig. 8.1(b)] which nowhere touches the current, but
has its bottom between the capacitor plates; its mouth is the circular
loop mentioned above. Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box
(without the lid) [Fig. 8.1(c)]. On applying Ampere’s circuital law to such
surfaces with the same perimeter, we find that the left hand side of
Eq. (8.1) has not changed but the right hand side is zero and not m i,

0
since no current passes through the surface of Fig. 8.1(b) and (c). So we
have a contradiction; calculated one way, there is a magnetic field at a
point P; calculated another way, the magnetic field at P is zero.
Since the contradiction arises from our use of Ampere’s circuital law,
this law must be missing something. The missing term must be such
that one gets the same magnetic field at point P,  no matter what surface
is used.

We can actually guess the missing term by looking carefully at
Fig. 8.1(c). Is there anything passing through the surface S between the
plates of the capacitor? Yes, of course, the electric field! If the plates of the
capacitor have an area A, and a total charge Q, the magnitude of the
electric field E between the plates is (Q/A)/e0 (see Eq. 2.41). The field is
perpendicular to the surface S of Fig. 8.1(c). It has the same magnitude
over the area A of the capacitor plates, and vanishes outside it. So what
is the electric flux F  through the surface S ? Using Gauss’s law, it is

of space where there is no conduction current, but there is only a
displacement current due to time-varying electric fields. In such a
region, we expect a magnetic field, though there is no (conduction)

current source nearby! The prediction of such a displacement current
can be verified experimentally. For example, a magnetic field (say at point
M) between the plates of the capacitor in Fig. 8.2(a) can be measured and
is seen to be the same as that just outside (at P).

The displacement current has (literally) far reaching consequences.
One thing we immediately notice is that the laws of electricity and
magnetism are now more symmetrical*. Faraday’s law of induction states
that there is an induced emf equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux.
Now, since the emf between two points 1 and 2 is the work done per unit
charge in taking it from 1 to 2, the existence of an emf implies the existence
of an electric field. So, we can rephrase Faraday’s law of electromagnetic
induction by saying that a magnetic field, changing with time, gives rise
to an electric field. Then, the fact that an electric field changing with
time gives rise to a magnetic field, is the symmetrical counterpart, and is

a consequence of the displacement current being a source of a magnetic
field. Thus, time- dependent electric and magnetic fields give rise to each
other! Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction and Ampere-Maxwell
law give a quantitative expression of this statement, with the current
being the total current, as in Eq. (8.5). One very important consequence
of this symmetry is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which we
discuss qualitatively in the next section.

8.3  ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

8.3.1  Sources of electromagnetic waves
How are electromagnetic waves produced? Neither stationary charges
nor charges in uniform motion (steady currents) can be sources of
electromagnetic waves. The former produces only electrostatic fields, while
the latter produces magnetic fields that, however, do not vary with time.
It is an important result of Maxwell’s theory that accelerated charges
radiate electromagnetic waves. The proof of this basic result is beyond
the scope of this book, but we can accept it on the basis of rough,
qualitative reasoning. Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency.
(An oscillating charge is an example of accelerating charge.)   This
produces an oscillating electric field in space, which produces an
oscillating magnetic field, which in turn, is a source of oscillating electric
field, and so on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields thus
regenerate each other, so to speak, as the wave propagates through the
space. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave naturally equals the
frequency of oscillation of the charge. The energy associated with the
propagating wave comes at the expense of the energy of the source – the
accelerated charge.

From the preceding discussion, it might appear easy to test the
prediction that light is an electromagnetic wave. We might think that all
we needed to do was to set up an ac circuit in which the current oscillate
at the frequency of visible light, say, yellow light. But, alas, that is not
possible. The frequency of yellow light is about 6 × 1014 Hz, while the
frequency that we get even with modern electronic circuits is hardly about
1011 Hz. This is why the experimental demonstration of electromagnetic 205

wave region), as in the Hertz’s experiment (1887).

Hertz’s successful experimental test of Maxwell’s
theory created a sensation and sparked off other
important works in this field. Two important
achievements in this connection deserve mention. Seven
years after Hertz, Jagdish Chandra Bose, working at
Calcutta (now Kolkata), succeeded in producing and
observing electromagnetic waves of much shorter
wavelength (25 mm to 5 mm). His experiment, like that
of Hertz’s, was confined to the laboratory.

At around the same time, Guglielmo Marconi in Italy
followed Hertz’s work and succeeded in transmitting
electromagnetic waves over distances of many kilometres.

We here make remarks on some features of electromagnetic waves.
They are self-sustaining oscillations of electric and magnetic fields in
free space, or vacuum. They differ from all the other waves we have
studied so far, in respect that no material medium is involved in the
vibrations of the electric and magnetic fields.

But what if a material medium is actually there? We know that light,
an electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. We
have seen earlier that the total electric and magnetic fields inside a
medium are described in terms of a permittivity ε and a magnetic
permeability µ (these describe the factors  by which the total fields differ
from the external fields). These replace ε  and µ  in the description to

0 0
electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations with the result that in
a material medium of permittivity ε and magnetic permeability µ, the
velocity of light becomes,

1
v =

µε (8.11)

Thus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties of
the medium. We shall see in the next chapter that the refractive index of
one medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities of
light in the two media.

The velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is an
important fundamental constant. It has been shown by experiments on
electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths that this velocity is the
same (independent of wavelength) to within a few metres per second, out
of a value of 3×108 m/s. The constancy of the velocity of em waves in
vacuum is so strongly supported by experiments and the actual value is
so well known now that this is used to define a standard of length.

The great technological importance of electromagnetic waves stems
from their capability to carry energy from one place to another. The
radio and TV signals from broadcasting stations carry energy. Light
carries energy from the sun to the earth, thus making life possible on
the earth. 207

8.4  ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM

At the time Maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, the
only familiar electromagnetic waves were the visible light waves. The existence
of ultraviolet and infrared waves was barely established. By the end of the
nineteenth century, X-rays and gamma rays had also been discovered.  We
now know that, electromagnetic waves include visible light waves, X-rays,
gamma rays, radio waves, microwaves, ultraviolet and infrared waves. The
classification of em waves according to frequency is the electromagnetic
spectrum (Fig. 8.4). There is no sharp division between one kind of wave
and the next. The classification is based roughly on how the waves are
produced and/or detected.

We briefly describe these different types of electromagnetic waves, in
208 order of decreasing wavelengths.

Waves

FIGURE 8.4 The electromagnetic spectrum, with common names for various
part of it. The various regions do not have sharply defined boundaries.

8.4.1  Radio waves
Radio waves are produced by the accelerated motion of charges in conducting
wires. They are used in radio and television communication systems. They
are generally in the frequency range from 500 kHz to about 1000 MHz.
The AM (amplitude modulated) band is from 530 kHz to 1710 kHz. Higher
frequencies upto 54 MHz are used for short wave bands. TV waves range
from 54 MHz to 890 MHz. The FM (frequency modulated) radio band
extends from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. Cellular phones use radio waves to
transmit voice communication in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) band. How
these waves are transmitted and received is described in Chapter 15.

8.4.2  Microwaves
Microwaves (short-wavelength radio waves), with frequencies in the
gigahertz (GHz) range, are produced by special vacuum tubes (called
klystrons, magnetrons and Gunn diodes). Due to their short wavelengths,
they are suitable for the radar systems used in aircraft navigation. Radar
also provides the basis for the speed guns used to time fast balls, tennis-
serves, and automobiles. Microwave ovens are an interesting domestic
application of these waves. In such ovens, the frequency of the microwaves
is selected to match the resonant frequency of water molecules so that
energy from the waves is transferred efficiently to the kinetic energy of
the molecules. This raises the temperature of any food containing water. 209

Physics
8.4.3 Infrared waves
Infrared waves are produced by hot bodies and molecules. This band
lies adjacent to the low-frequency or long-wave length end of the visible
spectrum. Infrared waves are sometimes referred to as heat waves. This
is because water molecules present in most materials readily absorb
infrared waves (many other molecules, for example, CO2, NH3, also absorb
infrared waves). After absorption, their thermal motion increases, that is,
they heat up and heat their surroundings. Infrared lamps are used in
physical therapy. Infrared radiation also plays an important role in
maintaining the earth’s warmth or average temperature through the
greenhouse effect. Incoming visible light (which passes relatively easily
through the atmosphere) is absorbed by the earth’s surface and re-
radiated as infrared (longer wavelength) radiations. This radiation is
trapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour.
Infrared detectors are used in Earth satellites, both for military purposes
and to observe growth of crops. Electronic devices (for example
semiconductor light emitting diodes) also   emit infrared and are widely
used in the remote switches of household electronic systems such as TV
sets, video recorders and hi-fi systems.

8.4.4 Visible rays
It is the most familiar form of electromagnetic waves. It is the part of the
spectrum that is detected by the human eye. It runs from about
4 × 1014 Hz to about 7 × 1014

 Hz or a wavelength range of about 700 –
400 nm. Visible light emitted or reflected from objects around us provides
us information about the world. Our eyes are sensitive to this range of
wavelengths. Different animals are sensitive to different range of
wavelengths. For example, snakes can detect infrared waves, and the
‘visible’ range of many insects extends well into the utraviolet.

8.4.5 Ultraviolet rays
It covers wavelengths ranging from about 4 × 10–7 m (400 nm) down to
6 × 10–10m (0.6 nm). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is produced by special
lamps and very hot bodies. The sun is an important source of ultraviolet
light. But fortunately, most of it is absorbed in the ozone layer in the
atmosphere at an altitude of about 40 – 50 km. UV light in large quantities
has harmful effects on humans. Exposure to UV radiation induces the
production of more melanin, causing tanning of the skin. UV radiation is
absorbed by ordinary glass. Hence, one cannot get tanned or sunburn
through glass windows.

Welders wear special glass goggles or face masks with glass windows
to protect their eyes from large amount of UV produced by welding arcs.
Due to its  shorter wavelengths, UV radiations  can be focussed into very
narrow beams for high precision applications such as  LASIK (Laser-
assisted in situ keratomileusis) eye surgery. UV lamps are used to kill
germs  in water purifiers.

Ozone layer in the atmosphere plays a protective role, and hence its
depletion by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) gas (such as freon) is a matter

210 of international concern.

8.4.6 X-rays
Beyond the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum lies the X-ray
region. We are familiar with X-rays because of its medical applications. It
covers wavelengths from about 10–8 m (10 nm) down to 10–13 m
(10–4 nm). One common way to generate X-rays is to bombard a metal
target by high energy electrons. X-rays are used as a diagnostic tool in
medicine and as a treatment for certain forms of cancer. Because X-rays
damage or destroy living tissues and organisms, care must be taken to
avoid unnecessary or over exposure.

8.4.7 Gamma rays
They lie in the upper frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum
and have wavelengths of from about 10–10m to less than 10–14m. This
high frequency radiation is produced in nuclear reactions and
also emitted by radioactive nuclei. They are used in medicine to destroy
cancer cells.

Table 8.1 summarises different types of electromagnetic waves, their
production and detections. As mentioned earlier, the demarcation between
different regions is not sharp and there are overlaps.

SUMMARY

1. Maxwell found an inconsistency in the Ampere’s law and suggested the
existence of an additional current, called displacement current, to remove
this inconsistency. This displacement current is due to time-varying electric
field and is given by

dΦ
i Ε
d = ε0 dt

and acts as a source of magnetic field in exactly the same way as conduction
current.

2. An accelerating charge produces electromagnetic waves. An electric charge
oscillating harmonically with frequency n, produces electromagnetic waves
of the same frequency n. An electric dipole is a basic source of
electromagnetic waves.

3. Electromagnetic waves with wavelength of the order of a few metres were
first produced and detected in the laboratory by Hertz in 1887. He thus
verified a basic prediction of Maxwell’s equations.

4. Electric and magnetic fields oscillate sinusoidally in space and time in an
electromagnetic wave. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields, E and
B are perpendicular to each other, and to the direction of propagation of
the electromagnetic wave. For a wave of frequency n, wavelength l,
propagating along z-direction, we have

They are related by E0/B0 = c.
5. The speed c of electromagnetic wave in vacuum is related to m0 and e0 (the

free space permeability and permittivity constants) as follows:

c = 1/ µ0 ε0 . The value of c equals the speed of light obtained from

optical measurements.
Light is an electromagnetic wave; c is, therefore, also the speed of light.
Electromagnetic waves other than light also have the same velocity c in
free space.
The speed of light, or of electromagnetic waves in a material medium is

given by v = 1/ µ ε
where m is the permeability of the medium and e its permittivity.

6. The spectrum of electromagnetic waves stretches, in principle, over an
infinite range of wavelengths. Different regions are known by different
names; g-rays, X-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible rays, infrared rays,
microwaves and radio waves in order of increasing wavelength  from 10–2 Å
or 10–12

 m to 106
 m.

They interact with matter via their electric and magnetic fields which set
in oscillation charges present in all matter. The detailed interaction and
so the mechanism of absorption, scattering, etc., depend on the wavelength
of the electromagnetic wave, and the nature of the atoms and molecules

212 in the medium.

POINTS TO PONDER

1. The basic difference between various types of electromagnetic waves
lies in their wavelengths or frequencies since all of them travel through
vacuum with the same speed. Consequently, the waves differ
considerably in their mode of interaction with matter.

2. Accelerated charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves. The
wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is often correlated with the
characteristic size of the system that radiates. Thus, gamma radiation,
having wavelength of 10–14 m to 10–15 m, typically originate from an
atomic nucleus. X-rays are emitted from heavy atoms. Radio waves
are produced by accelerating electrons in a circuit. A transmitting
antenna can most efficiently radiate waves having a wavelength of
about the same size as the antenna. Visible radiation emitted by atoms
is, however, much longer in wavelength than atomic size.

3. Infrared waves, with frequencies lower than those of visible light,
vibrate not only the electrons, but entire atoms or molecules of a
substance. This vibration increases the internal energy and
consequently, the temperature of the substance. This is why infrared
waves are often called heat waves.

4. The centre of sensitivity of our eyes coincides with the centre of the
wavelength distribution of the sun. It is because humans have evolved
with visions most sensitive to the strongest wavelengths from
the sun.
