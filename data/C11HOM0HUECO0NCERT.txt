Introduction 1
Human Ecology and Family Sciences 
Evolution of the discipline and its relevance to quality of life

Let us begin by trying to understand the title of this subject — ‘Human 
Ecology and Family Sciences’ (HEFS). The dictionary explains the 
term ‘ecology’ in two ways. Firstly, it is referred to as a branch of 
Biology that deals with relations between living organisms and their 
environment. Secondly, it is stated to be a complex of relationships 
between an organism and its environment. Borrowing from biology, 1
in our context, the ‘living organism’ is the human being, and hence 
the term ‘Human’ precedes ‘Ecology’.

Through this subject you will be studying about human beings 
in relation to their environment. Additionally, there will be a study 
of dynamic relationships that children, adolescents and adults 
have with the various physical, economic, social and psychological 
elements in their ecology.

The expression ‘Family Sciences’ is an equally significant 
segment in the title. As you would agree, the family is central in 
most individuals’ lives. It is within the family that children are 
nurtured, so that they develop and acquire independent identities 
as adults. While studying this subject, the students will be guided 
in understanding the individual in the context of the family, which 
in turn is a critical social unit of society. ‘Human Ecology and 
Family Sciences’ follows an integrated approach in the teaching-
learning process. More importantly it deals with the interaction of 
human beings as members of their families and the society with 
the environment. This forms a synergistic relationship with their 
ecology, which amalgamates within it physical, psychological, socio-
cultural and economic resources.

In the Class XI curriculum, you would notice that particular 
attention has been paid to the stage of adolescence, as this period is 
known to be a turning point in one’s life. Thus, you will study how

adolescents develop an understanding of themselves, and what role food 
and other resources, fabric and clothing, as well as communications play 
in their lives.

A subject close to HEFS, though not exactly like it, is Home Science. 
It has been taught under this title at both the higher secondary and 
university levels in different parts of the country. With changing times, 
many disciplines of study have taken new forms and assumed a more 
contemporary nomenclature; for example, Life Sciences is being used to 
refer to  biological sciences. There was a need to modernise the content of 
Home Science at the school level, and give it a title that would release it 
from being associated mainly with the home and with the tasks traditionally 
done by girls and women. At the university level the University Grants 
Commission undertook this exercise many years ago. 

Here, a brief history of the evolution of Human Ecology and Family 
Sciences from the field of Home Science in India would be in order. In the 
early 20th century there were many institutions in different parts of the 
country that had introduced courses in Foods and Nutrition, Clothing and 
Textiles, as well as Extension Education. These different disciplines were 
brought under the rubric of Home Science in 1932, when an institution 
by the name of Lady Irwin College was set up in Delhi to promote women’s 

2 education. This was the time before India’s independence from the British 
rule, when very few girls attended school, and hardly any institutions for 
women’s higher education existed. 

A few eminent women were in the vanguard of the movement to liberate 
India. Among them were Sarojini Naidu, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur and 
Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, stalwarts of the All India Women’s Conference, 
who conceived of and established the Lady Irwin College. The British 
Viceroy in India at that time was Lord Irwin, and his wife, Lady Dorothy 
Irwin too supported the setting up the college. Hence, the College was set 
up in her name. The goal was to serve the home and society with equal 
resolve, so as to remove social and educational inequalities that prevented 
women from reaching their potential.

Thus, Home Science was not intended to be a subject only about 
the ‘home’, but to be an interdisciplinary field that would empower its 
students to enhance their own quality of life and that of other individuals 
and families. However, over time, the label Home Science (in the mind-
set of lay people and non-Home Science professionals) became associated 
primarily with learning culinary skills, laundry and child-care. While at the 
higher education level an upgrading of the curricula as well as resetting 
of the professional standards took place several years ago, at the high 
school level, its gender-typing and association with ‘cooking and laundry’ 
remained. In fact, those were some of the reasons why boys were either 
not admitted to this area by the schools, or they themselves shied away

from studying it as it was seen as a subject only for girls. It was wrongly 
perceived as lacking in rigour. 

The present curriculum that has guided the preparation of the textbook 
is contemporary in its content and approach. It is so designed and presented 
that you will identify with the issues discussed. The title ‘Human Ecology 
and Family Sciences’ was considered to be most appropriate to reflect the 
spirit of the course. As you read the chapters, you will realise that the 
subject is multi-disciplinary. It contains within it fields such as Human 
Development, Food and Nutrition, Fabric and Apparel, Communication 
and Extension, and Resource Management. Knowledge in these areas is 
essential to sustain and augment one’s quality of life, whether one lives 
in a village or a town, and whether the person is female or male. The 
textbook, it is hoped, will answer some of the questions young people have 
about their lives, and not be perceived merely as a means to clear exams.

UNIT I 
Understanding Oneself: 
Adolescence

Unit I focusses on the stage of adolescence —  
the stage of life to which you belong at  5

present. This unit deals with understanding  
your own self in terms of your personal and  
social identity, your nutritional  and health 
requirements, management of basic resources 
of time and space, fabrics around you, and your 
communication skills. The last chapter of the  
unit situates the adolescent in the context of the family 
and larger society, thereby linking it to the next unit 
that deals with the individual in relation to her/his 
family, school, community and society.

Understanding 	
the Self 2
A. What makes me ‘I’

Learning Objectives
 
After completing sections A, B and C the learner is able to —
•	 discuss the importance of knowing oneself and the significance 

of developing a positive sense of self.
•	 list the factors that influence the development of selfhood and 

6 identity.
•	 analyse why the period of adolescence is critical for the 

development of self and identity.
•	 describe the characteristics of self during infancy, childhood 

and adolescence.

2A.1 Introduction 
While we all have many things in common with our parents, siblings, other 
relatives and friends, each one of us is also a unique person, different from 
all others. This sense of being unique gives us our sense of self — the sense 
of ‘I’ which is different from ‘you’, ‘them’ and ‘others’. How do we develop 
this sense of self ? What we think about ourselves and how we describe 
ourselves — does it change over the years? What are the elements of the 
self? Why should we study about the self? Does our self influence the way 
we interact with people? In this unit we will study about these and other 
interesting aspects of the self. 

Related to the concept of the self are two other concepts — identity and 
personality. While psychologists distinguish between these three concepts 
in terms of their definitions, the concepts are intricately related and we 
often interchange these terms in common usage.

Understanding the Self

2A.2 What is Self? 
The Webster’s Third New International Dictionary contains 500 entries 
that begin with ‘self ’. The sense of self refers to the sense of who we are 
and what makes us different from everyone else. During adolescence — 
the period you are going through presently — we start thinking more than 
ever about who am I? What makes ‘me’ different from ‘others’? At this 
stage, more than at any other stage before this, we try to define our ‘self ’. 
Some of you may have given this question a lot of thought, while some 
others may not be aware that they have been thinking of these aspects.

 Re-examine the statements you wrote to describe yourself, some of 
these described the physical aspects of yourself, you described your bodily 
self; in some you referred to your feelings and emotions; in some you 
described yourself in terms of your mental abilities; in some others you 
may have described yourself in relation to others, in terms of the roles  
you perform and the relationships you are involved in every day such 
as son/daughter, wife/sister, student, i.e., you defined yourself in terms 
of your social relationships in the family and community. Some of you 
may have described yourself in terms of your potential or capabilities 
and some others in terms of your beliefs. In some you described yourself 
as a doer, as a person performing actions, as an agent, while in others 
you described yourself as a thinker. Thus, you can see that the self has 
several dimensions. Very broadly speaking we can think of these various 
dimensions of the self as the personal and the social. The personal self

has those aspects which relate only to you while the social self refers to 
those aspects where you are involved with others, and includes aspects 
like sharing, cooperation, support and unity. 

We can say that the term self refers to the totality of a person’s 
experiences, ideas, thoughts and feelings with regard to herself/himself. It 
is the characteristic way in which we define ourselves. The idea that we 
hold of ourselves is the notion of the self.  

You must have heard and used the terms self-concept and self-esteem 
with reference to yourself and with others. What do you mean when you 
use them? Write your thoughts in the box below and discuss these after 
reading the definitions given after the box.

Self-concept and self-esteem are elements of identity. Self-concept 
is a description of oneself. It answers the question of ‘Who am I?’ Our 
self-concept includes our qualities, feelings and thoughts and what we are 
capable of doing.

An important aspect of the self-concept is self-esteem. Self-esteem 
refers to our judgment of ourselves according to the standards we have set 
for ourselves which are largely influenced by society.  It is one’s evaluation 
of oneself.

or was your answer both ‘Yes’ and ‘No’! for some time, and write your views 
Which is quite likely. Over the years your and the reasons for these views in the

know many more people now as compared 
to earlier times, and you have developed a 
certain relationship with them. Your way of 
responding to and understanding events may 
have changed, you may have changed some 
of your beliefs and values, and your likes and 
dislikes may have also changed. So you are 
not really the same person as you were even 
a year ago! Yet, you have an unmistakable 
sense of having been the same person from 
as far back as you can remember. Most of us 
are able to maintain a sense of continuity and 
sameness throughout our lives despite the 9
many changes and discontinuities that mark 
our life over the decades. In other words, 
we all have a sense of identity, a sense of 
who we are which we carry throughout our 
lives. Just as in the case of self, we can 
talk of personal identity and social identity.  
Personal identity refers to those attributes 
of a person that make her different from 
others. Social identity refers to those 
aspects of the person that link her to a group 
– professional, social or cultural. Thus, when 
you think of yourself as an Indian you have 
linked yourself with a group of people living 
in a country. When you describe yourself 
as a Gujarati or a Mizo, you are saying that 
you share some characteristics with the 
people living in that state, and that these 
characteristics seem to you to be different 
from people living in other states of India. 
Thus, being a Gujarati is one dimension of 
your social identity in the same way as being 
a Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or a Christian or 
being a teacher, farmer or lawyer.

B. Development and 
Characteristics 2
of the Self

The self is not something that you are born with, but which you create and 
develop as you grow.  In this section we will read about the development 
and characteristics of the self in infancy, early childhood, middle childhood 
and adolescence. 

2B.1 Self during Infancy 	
At birth we are not aware of our unique existence. Does that surprise 11
you?  This means that the infant does not realise that she/he is separate 
and distinct from the world outside – she/he has no self-awareness or 
self-understanding or self-recognition. By each of these terms we mean 
the mental representation (a mental picture) of the self. The infant brings 
her/his hand in front of her/his face and looks at it but does not ‘realise’ 
that the hand belongs to her/him and that she/he is separate from other 
people and things she/he sees around her. The sense of self emerges 
gradually during infancy and self-image recognition happens around  
18 months of age. One interesting experiment which has been carried out 
with infants in the age range 14-24 months is described below. You can 
try it out too.

Activity 1

Put a dot of red lipstick/colour on the cheek of the infant and then place the infant in 
front of the mirror. If the infant has an awareness of the self, she/he will touch her own 
cheek after looking at the red spot on the face in the mirror. If the infant does not have 
self-awareness, she/he will touch the reflection in the mirror, or just play with the reflection 
in the mirror as if it is another infant.

Towards the latter half of the 
second year, infants begin to use 
the personal pronouns – I, me and 
mine. They use these pronouns 
to indicate possession of persons 
or objects – “my toy” or “my 
mother”; to describe themselves 
or actions they are doing or their 
experiences – “me eating”. Infants 
also begin to recognise themselves 
in photographs at this time. 

2B.2 Self during Early 
Childhood 

Since children are able to talk quite fluently by the time they are 3 years 
old, we need not rely only on self-recognition to know young children’s self-
understanding. We can use verbal means by involving them in conversations 
about themselves. Researchers have found that the following are the five 
main characteristics of young children’s understanding of themselves. 

12
1.  They use physical descriptions of their self or material possessions 

to differentiate themselves from others – they may use descriptive 
words like ‘tall’, or ‘big’ or refer to the clothes they wear or the toys or 
objects they have. Their self-descriptions are in absolute terms – this 
means they do not see themselves in comparison with others. To give 
an example, instead of saying, “I am taller than Kiran”, the child will 
say, “I am tall.”

2.	 They describe themselves in terms of things they can do. For example, 
in terms of their play activities – “I can ride a cycle”; “I can make a 
house”; “I can count”.  Thus, their self understanding contains active 
descriptions of themselves. 

3.	 Their self descriptions are in concrete terms – i.e., they define 
themselves in terms of things they can do or what is visible to them – “I 
have a television.” 

4.	 They often overestimate themselves. Thus, a child may say, “I am 
never scared” or “I know all the poems”, but may not remember them 
completely. 

5.	 Young children are also unable to recognise that they can possess 
different attributes – that they can be ‘good’ and ‘bad’, ‘mean’ and ‘nice’ 
at different points in time.  
The following is a brief interaction between an adult and Radha, a girl 

aged 3 years 8 months, which reveals the child’s perception of herself. The

2B.3 Self during Middle Childhood 
During this period, children’s self-evaluations become more complex. 
There are five key changes that characterise this increasing complexity:
1.	 The child shifts towards describing herself in terms of her internal 

characteristics. The child is more likely to name her/his psychological 
characteristics (such as preferences or personality traits) in her self-
definition and less likely to name physical characteristics. Thus, the 
child may say, “I am good at making friends”, “I can work hard and 
finish my homework on time.” 

2.	 The child’s descriptions include social descriptions and identity – 
they may define themselves in terms of groups they belong to, “I am in 
the music choir in school”.

3.	 Children begin to make social comparisons and differentiate 
themselves from others in comparative rather than absolute terms. 
Thus, they begin to think about what they can do in comparison with 
others, for example, “I can run faster than Kiran.”

4.	 They begin to distinguish between their real self and ideal self. Thus 
they can differentiate between their actual competencies and those 
that they want to have or those which they think are most important. 

14 5.	 The self-descriptions become more realistic as compared to those of 
the pre-school child. This may be because of the ability to see things 
and situations from the point of view of others. 

2B.4 Self during Adolescence	
Self understanding becomes increas-
ingly complex during adolescence.   Activity 2
Adolescence is also seen as a critical 
time for identity development. What Make friends with a 5-year-old, a 9-

are the characteristics of this more year-old, and a 13-year-old. Ask them

discuss the first two aspects and then they say. Do you find that their self-

we shall discuss the features of the descriptions correspond with what you 

adolescent’s self. have read in this section?

Why is adolescence a critical time for identity 
development? 

According to a well-known psychologist Erik H. Erikson, at each stage of 
our development, from infancy to old age, we have to accomplish certain 
tasks which enable us to move on to the next stage of development. For 
example, a task during late infancy and early childhood (between 2-4 years 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 1.indd   14 8/4/2022   2:50:38 PM



Understanding the Self

of age) is to achieve bowel and bladder control. Without this, participation 
in most social and community activities would become impossible for the 
child.  The task during the period of adolescence, according to Erikson is 
to develop a sense of identity, a satisfactory self-definition. 

The reason why the stage of adolescence is critical for identity 
development is because there is an enhanced focus on the development of 
the self. It is believed that the adolescent faces an identity crisis. This is 
because of three reasons—
1.	 This is the time when the person, more than at any other point of 

her/his life before this, is preoccupied with trying to know oneself. 
This means that the person is intensely concerned with understanding 
herself/himself.  

2.	 Towards the end of adolescence the individual creates a relatively 
lasting sense of selfhood and identity and can say – “This is who I 
am”. 

3.	 This is also the time when the individual’s identity is influenced by 
rapid biological changes and changing social demands.

Let us understand this in more detail
The adolescent is now expected to behave in an adult-like manner and 
begin to take on responsibilities related to family, work or marriage. This 15
social transformation from dependent child to independent person occurs 
differently in different cultures. Western cultures generally emphasise 
independence in terms of ‘separation’ from parents (both physical and 
psychological). On the other hand, non-western cultures, such as the 
Indian, focus on interdependence within the family. In all cultures, 
however, adolescence is reported to be accompanied by dilemmas and 
disagreements. For instance, it is common to see that an adolescent 
may rebel against being treated “like a child” but at the same time may 
herself/himself seek comfort as a child would. The parents too may often 
tell the adolescent to “behave like a grown up”, but their other actions 
may indicate to the adolescent that they do not think that she/he is quite 
grown up. This may be somewhat different for girls and boys depending on 
the expectations of the family, in a particular culture. Thus, the adolescent 
herself experiences conflicting feelings and also receives conflicting 
messages and social expectations from the people around her/him.  You 
may have experienced this for yourself. For example, the family members 
may expect you to behave in an adult-like manner in social situations as 
far as talking or dressing is concerned, but may still think you are too 
young to discuss the family budget.  

Since individuals are different they may respond differently to situations. 
The conflicting expectations from familial and societal sources, one’s own 
changing needs and conflicting emotions may interfere with integrating 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 1.indd   15 8/4/2022   2:50:38 PM



Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part I

the newly emerging selves during adolescence. Thus, the adolescents may 
experience what is known as role confusion or identity confusion. They 
may show behaviours like the inability to concentrate on the work at hand, 
difficulty in starting or finishing work on time, and a general difficulty in 
coping with schedules. It is important to stress that the difficulties that 
the adolescent experiences in the process of developing an identity are a 
normal part of development – there is nothing inappropriate with the 
contradictory feelings and emotions the adolescent experiences during 
this period. The feeling of identity crisis or role confusion arises when 
the adolescent feels that there is a significant gap in terms of what she/
he is expected to do and how she/he is expected to behave as compared 
to earlier times. However, for many adolescents, especially those who are 
involved in family occupations, this sense of break may not be distinct 
and may not cause much emotional upheaval. For example, if a child in a 
village is assisting the family in agriculture, her/his role does not change 
much from when she/he was 12 to when she/he is 16, except may be in 
terms of being given more responsibility. 

16

The following are the characteristics of an adolescent’s sense of self. 
1. 	Self-descriptions during the period of adolescence are abstract. 

Adolescents are likely to lay less emphasis on describing themselves in 
physical terms as “tall”, or “big”; they emphasise the abstract or inner 
aspects of their personality. Thus, they may describe themselves as 
quiet, sensitive, cool headed, brave, emotional or truthful.

Understanding the Self

2. 	The self during adolescence carries several contradictions. Thus, 
adolescents may describe themselves as “I am calm but get easily 
disturbed” or “I am quiet and also talkative.” 

3.	 The adolescent experiences a fluctuating sense of self. As adolescents 
experience diverse situations and respond to different experiences, 
their understanding about their own self fluctuates over situations and 
over time. 

4.	 The self of the adolescent contains ‘the ideal self’ and ‘the real self’.  The 
ideal self becomes more prominent now. Each one of us has an idea 
of what and how one would ideally like to be. This could be called the 
ideal self, towards which we would like to develop. For example, a girl 
may want to be tall but is actually quite short.

5.	 Adolescents, more than children, are self-conscious and preoccupied 
with themselves. This gives them a feeling of always “being on stage” 
– a feeling that they are always being noticed. This is the reason why 
most adolescents are over-concerned about their physical appearance. 
We now know about the different 

characteristics of self during certain Activity 3
life stages. But how do we develop a 
sense of self in the first place? What Do you feel that you are experiencing 
influences the development of a any of the feelings and thoughts we 17

C.	Influences on 
Identity  
How do we Develop 2
a Sense of Self?

You have read that we are not born with a sense of selfhood or identity. 
How does it develop then? How does it evolve and change over time? The 
self develops as a result of what you learn about yourself through the 
experiences you have and through what others tell you about yourself. 
Each person lives in a web of relationships – these relationships are in 
the family, school, workplace and community. The sense of self develops 
as a result of interaction with the people around you and through your 

18 actions. Thus multiple people shape the development of your self and 
the construction of the self is a continuous dynamic process. The word 
‘construction’ implies that the self is not something that you are born with 
but which you create and develop as you grow. 

Activity 1

Recall any significant experience you have had. Did it influence the way you think about 
yourself? Note your observations in the space below.

Let us trace how the sense of self develops from the early years. From 
the earliest days, parents address the children by a particular name or 
names in a variety of situations. The children begin to associate the name 
with themselves. Along with this they also point to the child in the mirror 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 1.indd   18 8/4/2022   2:50:40 PM



Understanding the Self

and in photographs with that name. They use the pronouns ‘you’ and 
‘your’ and when they are able to speak, the use of the pronouns ‘me’ and 
‘mine’ appears. The child understands that ‘you’ and ‘your’ refer to another 
person. Parents play various ‘body games’ pointing and labeling various 
parts of the child’s body and ask the child to point out body parts in turn. 
All this helps the child to gradually learn to see herself/himself as distinct 
and separate from others. 

Second, as the child grows during infancy she begins to realise that her 
actions have an effect on the environment. For example, when she touches 
a toy it moves. All such experiences help her/him have a sense of being 
separate from other people and objects around her. If you recall the earlier 
discussion, this is also the time (around 18 months) when the child is able 
to identify that the spot of red is on her/his face and she/he does not treat 
the reflection in the mirror as another child.

Third, as the child grows older and can talk, the parents encourage the 
child to provide self–statements and ask her/him to give reasons. They ask 
the child, “Why did you do this?” or “How do you feel?” These questions 
help the child understand what she or he is experiencing or the reasons 
for certain actions; in this way they help the child in defining the self. 

Fourth, during the course of the day the child has several encounters 
with people and objects around her/him which help to develop an idea about 19
abilities. People also give the child a feedback about her or his behaviour 
and abilities. To a 6-year-old who helps in cleaning up the food area after 
the meal, the father may say, “That was a good thing to do. You are a good 
boy.” All this feeds into the child’s beliefs about herself/himself. The child 
thus constructs and re-constructs selfhood and sense of identity through 
the verbal-social interactions she/he has with caregivers and others. 

Developing a sense of self and identity
The reasons why each one of us has a unique identity is because
•	 each one of us (except identical twins) has a unique combination of 

genes.  
•	 each one of us has different experiences. 
•	 even if we have similar experiences, we respond to these in different 

ways. 

In this section we will study the influences on the formation of identity. 
These can be classified as—

•	 Biological and physical changes
•	 Socio-cultural contexts including family and peer relationships  
•	 Emotional changes
•	 Cognitive changes

2C.1	 Biological and Physical Changes  
The period of adolescence is marked by certain universal physical and 
biological changes in the body which take place in particular sequences. 
These changes lead to the attainment of sexual maturity. The time when 
sexual maturity is reached is called puberty. Menarche (first menstruation) 
is usually considered the point of sexual maturity for girls. There is 
no corresponding definite event marking puberty for boys, although a 
criterion sometimes used is the production of spermatozoa. Puberty 
occurs at different average ages in different cultures. A criterion of puberty 
that has been found useful for both boys and girls is that of maximum 
yearly increase in height. The age of most rapid growth comes just before 
menarche for girls and before certain adult characteristics in boys. This 
period during which physical and biological changes occur, leading to 
puberty is called pubescence. For most girls this period ranges from 11 
years to 13 years, and for boys it is 13 years to 15 years. Following is the 
list of changes in girls and boys showing normal sequence for development 
during pubescence.
Girls						      Boys

Growth of axillary hair	 	 	 Age of maximum growth
						      Growth of axillary hair
	 	 	 	 	 	 Marked voice changes
	 	 	 	 	 	 Development of the beard

 While the physical changes that take place in the body with the onset 
of puberty are universal, the psychological and social impact of these 
changes on the person vary from culture to culture and within a culture 
from person to person. We will discuss these aspects under the next two 
headings – socio-cultural contexts and emotional changes.  

2C.2	 Socio-cultural Contexts 
It has been stated that physical changes in the body and the changing 
social expectations are the two main aspects that influence the process 
of identity formation during the period of adolescence. But to what extent 
these physical and social changes impact the process of identity formation 
varies with cultural, social and familial contexts. In this section, let us first 
see how cultural and social contexts influence adolescent development 
and then we will read about the influence of the family.

Understanding the Self

Different sections of the society may respond differently to the physical 
changes during adolescence. In traditional Indian society, the onset of 
puberty places many restrictions on the girls while the boys retain their 
freedom of movement. Certain avenues of entertainment or work are not 
seen as appropriate for girls. The elements of the self and the identity of 
a girl from a traditional community would be very different from that of a 
girl living in urban areas.

Let us now compare our culture with Western cultures. In most Western 
cultures (such as the U.S. and U.K.) adolescents are expected to be fairly 
independent — in many cases they are expected to move away from the 
family to set up their own home. In the Indian context, a large majority of 
adolescents continue to be fairly dependent on parents as they are expected 
to be, and the family continues to exercise control over them. While many 
adolescents in India, especially in rural and tribal settings, begin to 
contribute towards the family income, and in this sense begin to assume 
adult roles, yet they do not break away from the family. Instead their efforts at 
earning are often aimed at the welfare of family members. The development 
of the self of an adolescent in these two cultural settings would be quite 
different. Even within India, the experiences of adolescents would be quite 
different in different communities. In traditional communities and regions 
where technology is not yet advanced and where occupational opportunity 21
and choices for alternative lifestyles are limited, children are trained in 
the traditional family occupations, such as weaving, up to the time they 
reach adolescence. Such adolescents are, therefore, ready to assume adult  
roles – this means they are seen as persons with responsibilities of 
beginning work, getting married and bearing children, like adults. Thus, 
in these communities the identity of the adolescent would be drawn more 
from familial sources. The adolescent may not enter into much conflict with 
elders since they are largely doing what adults expect of them. As a result, 
there are likely to be fewer confusions and doubts while developing a sense 
of self. On the other hand, in communities and families where a variety of 
occupational choices are open for the adolescent, where technology makes 
available many experiences and options to the individual, the adolescent 
may need to enter into an extended period of training to prepare herself/
himself for the chosen occupation. During this period the adolescent still 
remains dependent on the parents. While the period of adolescence is thus 
extended, that of adulthood is delayed. Also, the increase in choices and 
exposure to alternate lifestyles may bring the adolescent in conflict with 
parents and other authority figures in society. 

There is another reason why the development of identity is likely to 
vary in traditional cultures and cultures of the West. In traditional Indian 
communities, open reflection on oneself and the idea of talking about oneself 
is not a common activity among adolescents. In fact, such an attitude is 
often neither encouraged nor tolerated. Many Indians define themselves

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part I

primarily in one or the other roles that they play – son/ daughter, mother/
father, sister/brother. To put it differently, they often speak of themselves 
in terms of the family and the community – as “we” – rather than as “I”.   
For example, while talking about her views on marriage, an adolescent 
girl would say, “In our family marriages are arranged by parents”, rather 
than saying, “I would prefer my parents to arrange my marriage”. Thus we 
can see how important the socio-cultural context is in the construction of 
a sense of self. Of course the impact of these cultural influences will vary 
from family to family and person to person.

Having discussed how the culture and society impact adolescent identity 
development, let us read how the family can impact the development of 
the sense of identity. During adolescence identity formation is enhanced 
by family relationships where adolescents are encouraged to have their 
own point of view and where there is a secure relationship between 
family members which provides the adolescent with a secure base from 
which to explore her widening social world.  It has also been found that 
firm and affectionate parenting fosters healthy development of identity. 
‘Affectionate’ parenting means that the parents are warm, loving and 
supportive of the child’s effort and accomplishment.  They often praise the 
child, show enthusiasm in her/his activities, respond sensitively to her/

22 his feelings, and understand the child’s personality and points of view.  
However, such parents are also firm in disciplining. Such parenting style 
fosters independence and self-reliance in children.  

Adolescence is the period in which the growing individual develops a 
strong need for support and acceptance from the peers. At times, parental 
and peer values can be in conflict with each other and the adolescent may 
tend to lean more towards friends. This can cause disharmony in parent-
child relationships. Conforming to peer pressure can be both positive and 
negative.  The negative effects become evident when adolescents indulge 
in harmful behaviours such as smoking or consuming, drugs or alcohol or 
bullying. However, often peers and parents serve complementary functions 
and fulfil different needs of the adolescents. It has been seen that a family 
atmosphere that promotes both individuality and connectedness is 
important for the identity development of the adolescent.  By ‘Individuality’ 
implies greater opportunity and the ability to have one’s own point of view.  
‘Connectedness’ suggests greater sensitivity to and respect for others’ 
views and openness to others’ views.    

2C.3	  Emotional Changes 
The adolescent experiences many emotional changes in the process of 
growing up. Many of these changes are a consequence of the biological 
and physical changes that the adolescent is undergoing. It is true that 
adolescents are preoccupied with their physical body. They imagine that 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 1.indd   22 8/4/2022   2:50:40 PM



Understanding the Self

others are noticing each and every aspect of their body and behaviour. 
A young person with pimples on the face may feel that everyone is first 
and foremost noticing that.  However, there are individual differences 
in the way adolescents react to the bodily changes. A boy who does 
not have adequate growth of facial hair as compared to all the other 
boys of his age may feel peculiar about it. However, this same lack of 
facial hair may not disturb another boy. A sense of pride or comfort 
with the way one is developing physically will contribute positively to 
the adolescents’ sense of self. On the other hand, if the adolescent 
is dissatisfied with one’s appearance beyond a point, it can prevent 
from concentrating on other aspects of her/his personality, work or 
studies. This can cause a dip in performance at school and a lowering 
of self-image or self-esteem. A negative self-image can cause a person 
to feel insecure and also generate negative feelings about the body. 
An adolescent with a physical disability may not experience herself/
himself as any less than others, whereas a well-built adolescent boy 
may feel conscious and inadequate because he feels that his body is 
not “good enough”. 

The adolescent also experiences mood swings – for example, desiring 
the company of family members and friends at one time and wanting to be 
alone at other times. There may also be sharp bursts of anger. A lot of this 
happens as the adolescent is trying to make sense of and understand the 23
variety of changes she/he is experiencing at different levels. 

2C.4	  Cognitive Changes 
You will read in detail about the changes in thinking (cognition) that takes 
place from infancy to adolescence in Unit III titled ‘Childhood’. At this 
point we are briefly describing the cognitive changes that have an impact 
on the development of the sense of identity.

The child develops from a person who has no sense of a separate identity  
or sense of the individual self to one who describes the self in concrete and 
absolute terms during early childhood years. While the self-descriptions 
during middle childhood are also concrete, the difference is that these 
descriptions are now in comparative terms. By the time the child is 11, 
the self descriptions are fairly realistic enabling the child to differentiate 
between the ‘real’ and the ‘ideal’ self.  

During adolescence, the leap that takes place is that adolescents can 
think in abstract terms, i.e., they can think beyond what is present and 
what they see and experience. Further, as thought becomes flexible, they 
can think of hypothetical situations — in other words, they can imagine 
the various possibilities and their outcomes without necessarily having 
to go through them or act out the steps of any outcome. The implication 
for identity formation is that adolescents can imaginatively link up their 
present with a future they imagine for themselves. For example, the 

Reprint 2025-26

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part I

adolescent can think of the possible careers that she/he can take up as 
an adult which are suited to her/his situation and temperament, and plan 
the current direction of her/his studies accordingly. 

Thus, adolescence is a crucial stage for the development of identity. 
In fact, adolescence is a significant period of development involving many 
changes and opportunities. If the adolescent is healthy, she/he is able to 
deal with the changes in the best possible manner and realise one’s full 
potential. Appropriate food and nutrition are the key elements of good 
health. The next chapter discusses food, nutrition, health and fitness 
concerns during adolescence.

3.1 Introduction 
The onset of adolescence brings with it many profound changes. The growth 
rate speeds up dramatically. This growth spurt occurs due to the activity 
of hormones that affect every organ of the body and this makes healthy 
eating very important. The nutrient needs rise throughout childhood, peak 
in adolescence and then level off or even diminish as the teenager becomes 
an adult. The saying ‘‘You are what you eat” seems to be proven true. We 
eat different kinds of food such as dal, chapatti, bread, rice, vegetables, 
milk, lassi, etc. All these different kinds of food provide us with nutrients 
to keep us healthy and active. It is important to know what food to eat in 
order to stay healthy. The science of food and nutrients and their action 
on our health is called Nutrition.

##3##
Food, Nutrition, Health and Fitness

Nutrition and health, in fact, are two sides of the same coin. They 
are, therefore, inseparable. Health depends to a large extent on nutrition, 
and nutrition depends on the food intake. So food, is the most important 
single factor for health and fitness.

Let us define and describe food, nutrition, health and fitness
•	 Food   can be defined as anything solid or liquid which when swallowed,  

digested and assimilated in the body provides it with essential substances 
called nutrients and keeps it well. It is the basic necessity of life. Food 
supplies energy, enables growth and repair of tissues and organs. It 
also protects the body from disease and regulates body functions.

•	 Nutrition is defined as the science of foods, nutrients and other 
substances they contain; and of their actions within the body including 
ingestion, digestion, absorption, metabolism and excretion. While 
this summarises the physiological dimensions, nutrition has social, 
psychological and economic dimensions too. 

•	 Nutrients are the constituents in food that must be supplied to the 
body in suitable amounts. These include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, 
minerals, vitamins, water and fibre. We need a wide range of nutrients 
to keep ourselves healthy. Most foods contain more than one nutrient 
such as milk has proteins, fats, etc. Nutrients can be classified as 29
macronutrients and micronutrients on the basis of the required 
quantity to be consumed by us everyday. The figure on the next page 
shows us the distinction between macronutrients and micronutrients.

3.2	 Balanced Diet
A balanced diet is one which includes a variety of foods in adequate amounts 
and correct proportions to meet the day’s requirements of all essential 
nutrients such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, water, 
and fibre. Such a diet helps to promote and preserve good health and 
also provides a safety margin or reserve of nutrients to withstand short 
durations of deprivation when they are not supplied by the diet.

The safety margin takes care of the days we fast, or the short-term 
deficiency of certain nutrients in the daily diet. If the balanced diet meets 
the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for an individual, then the 
safety margin is already included since RDAs are formulated keeping extra 
allowances in mind. 

Recommended Dietary Allowances = Requirements + Margin of safety

A balanced diet takes care of the following aspects.
1.	 Includes a variety of food items
2.	 Meets the RDA for all nutrients
3.	 Includes nutrients in correct proportions

3.3	 Health and Fitness
According to World Health Organisation (WHO) ‘‘Health is the state 
of complete physical, emotional, and social well-being, not merely the 
absence of diseases or infirmity.’’ This definition has remained unchanged 
since 1948.

All of us want to maintain positive health, i.e., a perfect blend of physical, 
social and mental. Taking adequate amounts of essential nutrients in our 
diet is necessary to maintain positive health. 

Physical health is probably the most easily understood aspect. Mental 
health can be defined as a state of emotional and psychological 
well-being in which an individual is able to use her or his cognitive 
and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary 
demands of everyday life. In other words, the absence of a recognised 
mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health. One way 
to assess mental health is to see how effectively and successfully a person 
functions. Feeling capable and competent, being able to handle normal 31
levels of stress, maintaining satisfying relationships, and leading an 
independent life; and being able to ‘bounce back’ or recover from difficult 
situations are all signs of good mental health.

Physical fitness is good bodily health; it is the result of regular exercise, 
proper diet and nutrition, and proper rest for physical recovery. The term 
physical fitness is used in two ways: general fitness (a state of health 
and well-being) and specific fitness (a task-oriented definition based on 
the ability to perform specific aspects of sports or occupations). Physical 
fitness is the capacity of the heart, blood vessels, lungs, and muscles to 
function at optimal efficiency. Earlier, fitness was defined as the capacity to 
carry out the day’s activities without undue fatigue. Automation, increased 
leisure time, and changes in lifestyles following the Industrial Revolution 
meant that this criterion was no longer sufficient. In the present context, 
optimum efficiency is the key. 

Physical fitness is now defined as the body’s ability to function 
efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to 
resist diseases and to meet emergency situations. Fitness can also be 
divided into five categories: aerobic fitness, muscular strength, muscular 
endurance, flexibility, and body composition. Being fit prepares one to 
meet mental and emotional challenges. One feels strong and energetic if 
one is fit. Fitness provides one with the ability to meet routine physical 
demands with enough reserve energy to rise to a sudden challenge, such 
as running to catch a bus.

Thus, health is a state of complete mental, physical and social well-
being whereas fitness is the ability to meet the demands of a physical task. 
A well-nourished and fit person is better able to learn and has more energy, 
stamina, and self-esteem. A healthy eating pattern along with regular 
exercise will certainly help to remain fit. Teenagers between the ages of 12 
and 18 who have unhealthy eating behaviours and are undernourished 
develop eating disorders.

3.4	 Using Basic Food Groups for 
Planning Balanced Diets

One of the simplest ways to plan a balanced diet is to divide foods into 
groups and then make sure that each group is included in the meals. A 
food group consists of different foods which have common characteristics. 
These common features may be the source of food, the physiological 
function performed, or the nutrients present.

Foods can be grouped on the basis of the predominant nutrients 
present in them. This classification varies from one country to another 
depending on many factors. The five food group classification is used in 
India as a guide to meal planning. Many factors have been considered while 

32 compiling these groups such as availability of food, cost, meal pattern, and 
deficiency diseases prevalent. Not all foods in each group are equal in their 
nutrient content. That is why a variety of foods from each group should be 
included in the diet.

A classification based on nutrients present will ensure that all nutrients 
are made available to the body and offer greater variety within the group. 

There are five basic food groups suggested by the Indian Council of 
Medical Research (ICMR). These include:

•	 Cereals, grains and products
•	 Pulses and legumes
•	 Milk and meat products
•	 Fruits and vegetables
•	 Fats and sugars

Guidelines for using the basic food groups
The five food group system can be used both for planning and 
assessing balanced diets. It is a simple daily food guide which can 
be used for nutrition education as well. Guidelines could be adopted 
depending on the food groups.
•	 Include at least one or a minimum number of servings from each 

food group in each meal.
•	 Make choices within each group as foods within each group are 

similar but not identical in nutritive value.
•	 If the meal is vegetarian, use suitable combinations to improve 35

the overall protein quality of the diet. For example, serving cereal-
pulse combinations or including small quantities of milk or curds 
in the meal.

•	 Include uncooked vegetables and fruits in the meals.
•	 Include at least one serving of milk to ensure a supply of calcium 

and other nutrients as milk contains all nutrients except iron, 
vitamin C, and fibre.

•	 Cereals should not supply more than 75 per cent of total Kcal/
Calories.  

In planning balanced diets, food should be chosen from each group in 
sufficient quantity. Cereals and pulses should be taken adequately, fruits and 
vegetables liberally, animal foods moderately and oils and sugars sparingly.

Now let us look at the concept of the food guide pyramid.

Figure 2: Food Guide Pyramid

The food guide pyramid is a graphic depiction of the daily food guide. 
The illustration was designed to depict variety, moderation, and also 
proportions. The size of each section represents the number of daily 
servings recommended.  The broad base at the bottom conveys the message 
that grains should be abundant and form the foundation of a healthy 
diet.  Fruits and vegetables appear at the next level, showing that they 
have a less prominent, but still important place in the diet.  Meats and 
milks appear in a smaller band near the top.  A few servings of each can 
contribute valuable nutrients such as proteins, vitamins and minerals, 
without too much fat and cholesterol.  Fats, oils and sweets occupy the 
tiny apex, indicating that they should be used sparingly.            

Alcoholic beverages do not appear in the pyramid, but they too,  
if consumed, should be limited.  Items such as spices, coffee, tea and diet 
soft drinks provide few, if any, nutrients, but can add flavour and pleasure 
to meals when used judiciously.

The daily food guide plan and food guide pyramid emphasise grains, 
vegetables, and fruits. These are all plant foods.  Some 75 per cent of a

day’s servings should come from these three groups.  This strategy helps 
all people obtain complex carbohydrates, fibre, vitamins, and minerals 
with little fat.  It also makes diet planning for vegetarians easier.

3.5	 Vegetarian Food Guide
Vegetarian diets rely mainly on plant foods: grain, vegetables, legumes, 
fruits, seeds, and nuts.  Some vegetarian diets include eggs, milk products, 
or both.  People who do not eat meats or milk products can still use the 
daily food guide to create an adequate diet.  The food groups are similar 
and the number of servings remains the same. Vegetarians can select 
alternatives to meat such as legumes, seeds, nuts, tofu and for those who 
eat them, eggs. Legumes, and at least one cup of dark leafy greens, help 
to supply the iron that meats usually provide. Vegetarians who do not 
drink cow’s milk can use soy ‘milk’ – a product made from soyabeans that 
provides similar nutrients if it has been fortified with calcium, vitamin D, 
and Vitamin B12 (i.e., these nutrients are added).   

The food guide pyramid emphasises foods from the five food groups 
shown in the three lower sections of the pyramid.   Each of these food 
groups provides some, but not all of the nutrients you need.  Foods in 
one group cannot replace those in another.  No one food group is more 37
important than another – for good health you need all of them.

The pyramid is an outline of what to eat each day.   It is not a right 
prescription, but a general guide that lets you choose a healthful diet that 
is right for you.  The pyramid calls for eating a variety of foods to get the 
nutrients you need, and at the same time, the right amount of Calories to 
maintain a healthy weight.

3.6	 Dietary Patterns in Adolescence
Healthy eating is vital for the teenager’s health and well-being. The 
nutritional needs of adolescents vary tremendously, but generally increase 
due to rapid growth and changes in body composition that occur during 
puberty. Adequate nutrition is vital for ensuring overall emotional and 
physical health. Good eating habits help prevent chronic illness in the 
future, including obesity, heart disease, cancer and diabetes.

Studies of nutrient intakes have shown that adolescents are likely to 
obtain less vitamin A, thiamine, iron, and calcium than recommended. 
They also ingest (consume) more fat, sugar, protein, and sodium than is 
currently thought to be optimal.

While concern is often expressed over the habit of eating between 
meals, it has been shown that teenagers obtain substantial nourishment 
from foods eaten outside of the traditional meals. The choice of foods they 
make is of greater importance than the time or place of eating. Emphasis 

Reprint 2025-26

should be placed on fresh vegetables and fruits as well as whole-grain 
products to complement the foods high in energy value and protein that 
they commonly choose.

What are the commonly adopted eating habits of adolescents and why 
are they important to recognise? Understanding diet patterns will help 
us to be better prepared to evaluate the nutritional adequacy of diets and 
ensure that they are meeting the minimum requirements to maintain health 
and well-being. Among the more common eating idiosyncracies include 
skipping meals, consuming fast foods in a routine way, avoiding fruits and 
vegetables, snacking frequently and dieting. By addressing each of these 
issues individually you can ensure that you are meeting the minimum 
nutritional requirements.

Irregular meals and skipping meals: The numbers of meals teenagers 
miss and eat away from home increases from early adolescence to late 
adolescence, reflecting the growing need for independence and time away 
from home. The evening meal appears to be the most regularly eaten meal 
of the day. Girls are found to skip the evening meal, as well as breakfast and 
lunch, more often than boys. In some homes with limited resources, the 
adolescents may not even receive adequate number of meals or amounts, 
leading to nutrient deficiency.

38 Breakfast is frequently neglected and is omitted more often by teenagers 
and young adults under 25 years of age than by any other age groups in 
the population. A likely explanation as to why girls are more apt to miss 
breakfast than are boys is the pursuit of thinness and frequent attempts 
at dieting. Many teenage girls believe that they can control their weight by 
omitting breakfast or lunch. In fact, this approach is likely to accomplish 
just the opposite. By mid-morning or lunchtime they may be so hungry 
that they overcompensate for the “saved kilocalories.” As a matter of fact, 
skipping breakfast can slow your metabolism contributing to weight gain 
and poor performance. 

Snacking: Snacking is probably a survival technique for teens. 
Snacking does not have to be a bad habit. It can help maintain energy levels, 
particularly in active and growing adolescents. Many adolescents fail to 
eat three regular meals per day because of the ‘skipping meal’ factor. Thus 
snacking can actually be beneficial to ensure adequate intake of essential 
nutrients. However, surviving only on snacks is harmful to health.

Fast foods: Adolescents, particularly in urban areas, are more apt to 
eat fast food because it is convenient and typically a social affair, and they 
may believe it is the fashion of the day. Fast food is often packed with 
fat and “empty calories”. We should make smart food choices even when 
visiting fast food restaurants. Table 2 provides important information 
about fast foods.

Dieting: Obesity is becoming a crucial problem among adolescents. 
Intervention is needed to maintain ideal body weight among the entire

population. If this is not maintained, 80 per cent of them will stay 
overweight as adults. This can put them at risk for many medical problems, 
including diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and sleep apnea 
(a sleep disorder).

Table 2: Nutritional Limitations of Fast Foods

The following factors appear to be the major nutritional limitations of fast-food meals.
Calcium, riboflavin, vitamin A: These essential nutrients are low unless milk or a 
milkshake is ordered.
Folic acid, fibre: There are few fast food sources of these key factors.
Fat: The percentage of energy from fat is high in many meal combinations.
Sodium: The sodium content of fast food meals is high, which is not desirable.
Energy: Common meal combinations contain excessive energy when compared with 
the amounts of other nutrients provided.

Although fast foods can contribute nutrients to the diet, they cannot completely meet 
the nutritional needs of teenagers. Both adolescents and health professionals should be 
aware that fast foods are acceptable nutritionally when they are consumed judiciously 
and as a part of a well-balanced diet. But when they become the mainstay of the diet 
there is cause for concern. A nutrient imbalance may not appear to be a problem until a 
number of years have gone by, unless some specific problem such as a chronic disease 39
exists. However, evidence is accumulating to show that food intake patterns of teenagers 
affect their health in later life.

However, adolescents with normal weight often diet because of the 
perception that “thin is in”. Girls are bombarded with messages from the 
media about thinness, images of what is considered a beautiful body, and ways 
to achieve a lower body-weight. The images, in the context of a society that 
places a high value on physical beauty, sends mixed messages to teenagers 
and may result in unhealthy, unnecessary attempts to lose weight.

Dieting unsupervised by experts can lead to dangerous outcomes 
including eating disorders in teens. Some symptoms of dieting include: 
skipping meals, ‘binge’ eating, fasting or use of laxatives or diet pills. 
Consequences of such dieting include its possible association with 
cycles of weight loss and regain that increase the likelihood of developing 
eating disorders and obesity, lowered self-esteem and other psychological 
problems. This can lead to increased cardiovascular risk (heart problems) 
and possible mortality.

One approach to overcome the problems related to dieting is to attempt to 
eliminate the term ‘diet’ and replace it with ‘healthy eating’. If you regularly 
incorporate healthy lifestyle and dietary practices into your life, you are less 
likely to diet on a consistent basis. Recognising good eating habits is the 
first step towards encouraging healthy diets. It is best to adopt a healthy 
lifestyle that incorporates sound eating habits and regular exercise.

3.7	 Modifying diet related behaviour 
As you have read in the chapter on ‘Self ’, adolescence is a time when an 
individual begins to question authority and tries to establish her/his status. 
Eating behaviour is one of the mediums through which individuality may 
be expressed by adolescents. Thus, rejection of routine home food (which 
may be healthy) and eating outside (not so healthy), sometimes in order to 
conform to peer preferences, is not uncommon in adolescence.

It is easier for us to change lifestyle and diet patterns if we are convinced 
that we want to do so. What are the ways in which adolescents can modify 
their own behaviour? The next section tells us more about how to adopt 
healthy dietary practices.

Limiting television viewing: Television viewing should be limited to 
about one or two hours each day (this includes playing video games or using 
the computer). Watching television does not use up many Calories and it 
encourages eating erratically, since it is common to eat while watching TV. 
Overeating and under-eating is common among those who do it.

Healthy eating habits: Eat three balanced meals of average size each 
day, plus two nutritious snacks. One must try not to skip meals.

Snacks: Snacks should be limited to two each day and they can include 
40 low calorie foods, such as raw fruits or vegetables. Avoid using high calorie 

or high fat foods for snacks, especially potato chips, biscuits and fried 
foods. Of course, favourite snacks can be consumed once in a while, but 
this should not be made a habit.

Drinking water: Drinking four to six glasses of water each day, 
especially before meals is a good habit. Water has no calories and it will 
create a feeling of fullness. Avoid drinking soft drinks and fruit juices too 
frequently, as they are high in energy (150-170 calories per serving).

Diet journal: It helps to keep a weekly journal of food and beverage 
intake and also of the amount of time that is spent in watching television, 
playing video games and exercising. Recording body weight each week is 
a good practice.

Exercise: This is essential for healthy life. Participating in extra-
curricular activities such as sports helps to keep activity levels high.

Some tips to increase physical activities include:
•	 Walk or ride a bicycle for short distances.
•	 Use stairs instead of elevators in a building.
•	 Do regular exercise for 20-30 minutes, 3-4 times each week. This can 

include walking, jogging, swimming or bike riding. Playing games and 
sports, such as skipping rope, hockey, basketball, volleyball, or football, 
and doing yoga are also advisable at all ages. 
Substance use and abuse: Substance use and abuse in adolescence is 

a public health problem of major significance and concern. The substances 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 1.indd   40 8/4/2022   2:50:45 PM



Food, Nutrition, Health and Fitness

most widely abused by adolescents are tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana and 
other addictive drugs. The abuse of drugs and alcohol has a harmful effect 
on the nutrition and health status of adolescents. Nutrition intervention, 
support, and counselling would play a major role in the physical and 
psychosocial rehabilitation process. 

Much of what we have discussed may be more relevant for adolescents 
in urban and semi-urban areas. Rural environments would be different. 
Rural girls and boys are often engaged in agricultural tasks. They may also 
be helping their parents in enterprises such as poultry-keeping, cattle-
rearing and bee-keeping. Boys may be helping in farming. Girls also help 
in looking after their younger siblings as well as cooking and cleaning 
while their parents earn livelihood. Then there are the tasks of collecting 
fodder for the cattle, firewood and water. In tribal areas many people are 
dependent on forest products like berries, flowers, leaves, roots. They 
spend time gathering and processing these products.

Girls and boys doing these tasks will have high activity levels and 
therefore, their energy needs will be higher. Protein needs are also higher 
due to the high growth rate at adolescence. The chances of adolescents 
being malnourished are, therefore, very high in rural areas among the 
poorer communities. Girls in particular are known to be anaemic (low iron 
in blood) and require iron rich foods to be healthy. Adolescents from rich 41
families in rural areas would face many of the same problems as those in 
urban areas in the higher income groups. They would tend to be sedentary 
and enjoy rich food having plenty of fat and carbohydrate.

Adolescence and Anaemia

Anemia afflicts an estimated two billion people worldwide, mostly due to iron deficiency. 
It primarily affects women and girls. The latest National Family Health Survey-3 
(NFHS-3) conducted in 2005-06 has revealed that 56 per cent of adolescent girls are 
anaemic as compared to 30 per cent of adolescent boys. Compare this with the figure 
of 70 per cent for young children in the age range 6-59 months. It has also been found 
that the incidence of anaemia is actually increasing when compared to the last survey 
conducted in 1991-92.
        The prevalence of anemia is disproportionately high in developing countries like India, 
due to poverty, inadequate diet, certain diseases, repetitive pregnancy and lactation, and 
poor access to health services.
       Adolescence is an opportune time for interventions to address anaemia. In addition 
to growth needs, girls need to improve iron status before pregnancy. Both boys and girls 
have access to information about anaemia through schools, recreational activities and 
via the mass media. This can be used effectively to transmit messages about iron-rich 
foods and iron supplements where necessary.

3.8	 Factors influencing eating behaviour
By the time a person reaches adolescence the influences on eating habits 
are numerous and the formation of those habits is extremely complex, as 
shown in Figure 3. The growing independence of adolescents, increased 
participation in social life, and a generally busy schedule of activities have 
a definite impact on what they eat. They are beginning to buy and prepare 
more food for themselves and they often eat rapidly and away from home.

In order to encourage adolescents to form reasonably healthy eating 
habits parents should give their children the opportunity to choose from 
a range of nourishing foods as they are growing up. By the time they are 
teenagers they will need some freedom to use the kitchen; this is true for 
boys as well as for girls. 

While the basic foundation for eating habits is found in the family, many 
influences on eating behaviour originate outside the home. The influence 
of peers can be a useful source of support, as well as a source of stress for 
the adolescent. Peer influence and support can be helpful for overweight 
teenagers, although the same peers can also target such adolescents for 
teasing. 

Teenagers are very vulnerable to advertising messages. Television 
food commercials and eating habits portrayed in programme content have 43
influenced people for more than a decade. The majority of advertisements 
are for products with a high concentration of sweetness and fat. Hence, 
adolescents have to be discerning while consuming such food products.

The ease of obtaining food that is ready to eat also influences the 
eating habits of teenagers. Through home delivery/vending machines, at 
movies, melas and sporting events, at fast-food outlets and convenience 
groceries, food is available at numerous times throughout the day. Hence, 
adolescents may eat more often as well as more of not-so-healthy food 
stuffs. Watching this tendency is advisable.  

3.9	 Eating disorders at adolescence	
Adolescence is associated with rapid physical growth and body-image 
development eating disorders are of special concern at this time. These 
changes intensify associated self-esteem problems. Anorexia nervosa, for 
example, is a disorder so tied to body image distortion that it is most 
commonly seen in adolescence, the period when a person is struggling 
with self-identity and most vulnerable to body image problems. Progress 
in adopting a normal adult body image will be interrupted for the teenager 
with an eating disorder.

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 1.indd   43 8/4/2022   2:50:46 PM



Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part I

To understand anorexia nervosa let us take the example of Sonam. 
She aspires to have a perfect body. She has been ignoring the advice of 
her parents and teachers and almost stopped eating. She has become 
obsessed with having a very thin body. Although her current weight is 
normal, she feels pressured to be “ideally” thin like some actresses in 
movies or models in magazines. She has a low self-esteem and remains 
depressed, and this has resulted in her withdrawing from her family and 
friends. She is unaware that she is undernourished and insists that she is 
fat. She is a clear case of the eating disorder called anorexia nervosa. She 
is unaware that drastic loss of weight can even lead to death.

Bulimia is another type of eating disorder. Bulimia often begins in late 
adolescence or early adulthood after a series of various unsuccessful weight 
reduction diets. Those with bulimia indulge in bingeing (overeating) and 
inducing purging by vomiting or using laxatives. Although more common in 
females, about five to ten per cent of all eating disorders occur in males too.

Anorexia and bulimia can have serious consequences such as 
convulsions, renal failure, irregular heartbeats and dental erosion. In 
adolescent girls, anorexia can delay the onset of menstruation, permanently 
minimise stature and result in osteoporosis (weakening of bones). 

Perhaps a person’s best defense against these disorders is to learn to 

44 appreciate one’s uniqueness. Respecting and valuing oneself will certainly 
be life saving. Important dietary interventions include ensuring balanced 
diets, enhancing dietary fibre intake and using nutrient/food supplements 
to make up losses.

To sum up, physical, social and emotional changes experienced during 
adolescence can profoundly impact the adolescent’s nutritional status 
and eating patterns. Although young people are rarely motivated to learn 
about nutrition for the sake of longevity, learning how to apply sound 
dietary principles to reach our health goals can help build the foundation 
to a healthier life, now and in the future.

Health is a key resource of young people; it influences the availability 
and use of other resources that are important in everyday life. What are 
the other resources that an individual has? The following chapter on 
Management of Resources addresses this question and also discusses how 
best one can utilise and manage key resources such as time, energy and 
money.

Management of Resources

Human and Non-human Resources

Human Resources 
Human resources are central to carrying out any activity. These resources 
can be developed through training and self-development. For example, 
knowledge regarding any field/task can be acquired, skill may developed 
which will help you to develop aptitude. Let us read about human resources 
in detail. 
(a) 	Knowledge – It is a resource one uses throughout one’s life and is a 

pre-requisite for carrying out any activity successfully. A cook must 
have knowledge of how to operate cooking gas or chullah before she/he 
starts preparing food. A teacher who does not have thorough knowledge 
of her/his subject, cannot become an effective teacher. One needs to be 
open to acquiring knowledge throughout one’s life. 

(b) 	Motivation/Interest: There is a common saying, ‘Where there is a will 
there is a way’. This indicates that to accomplish any task, the worker 
must be motivated and interested in doing it. For example, if a student 
is not interested in learning a task, even when other resources are 
available, she/he still may give excuses and not finish the task. We 
may pursue dance, painting, reading fiction, art and craft and other 
hobbies as per our motivation. 49

(c) 	Skills/Strength/Aptitude: All individuals may not be skilled in 
performing all activities. Each one of us has an aptitude in certain 
areas. We can therefore carry out activities in these areas better as 
compared to others.  For example, pickles and chutney prepared by 
different individuals will taste different depending upon their skill. 
However, we can acquire skills we do not have through learning and 
training. 

(d) 	Time: It is a resource available to everyone equally. There are 24 hours 
in a day and every one spends it in her/his own way. Time once lost 
cannot be regained. Hence, it is the most valuable resource. Managing 
time in a specific period and attaining the goal is very important. We 
need to continuously plan and be able to utilise the available time to 
finish the desired task.

	 	 Time can be thought of in terms of three dimensions — work time, 
non-work time, rest and leisure time. We need to learn and balance time 
across these three dimensions in order to be able to accomplish one’s 
goals. When one learns to balance all the three dimensions, it helps the 
individual to be physically fit, emotionally strong and intellectually alert. 
You should be aware of the peak periods when you are best able to work 
and use this precious resource effectively to accomplish your goals.

(e) 	Energy: For sustaining individual growth and physical output, energy 
is essential. Energy levels vary from person to person, according to their 
physical fitness, mental condition, personality, age, family background

and their standard of living. To conserve energy and to use it most 
effectively, one must carefully think and plan through the activity so 
that one can complete the task efficiently. 

Non-human Resources
(a) 	Money: We all require this resource but it is not equally distributed 

among us – some have less of this resource as compared to others. We 
need to remember that money is a limited resource and must be spent 
judiciously to fulfil our requirements.  

(b) 	Material Resources: Space, furniture, clothes, stationery, food items, 
etc., are some of the material resources. We require these resources to 
carry out activities.  

Individual and Shared Resources 

(a)	 Individual Resources: These are resources which are available to an 
individual for personal use only. These can be human or non-human 
resources. Your own skills, knowledge, time, your school bag, your 
clothes are some of the examples of individual resources.

(b)	Shared resources: These are resources which are available to many 
50 members of the community/society. Shared resources can be natural 

or community based.

Natural and Community Resources 

(a) 	Natural Resources: Resources available in nature, like water, 
mountains, air, etc., are natural resources. These are available to all 
of us. In order to protect our environment, each one of us has the 
responsibility of judiciously using these resources.

(b) 	Community Resources:  These resources are available to an individual 
as a member of community/society. These are generally provided 
by government. These may be human or non-human. Consultancy 
provided by government hospitals, doctors, roads, parks and post 
offices are some examples of community resources. Every individual 
must strive to optimally use these resources and feel responsible in 
maintaining them.

Characteristics of Resources

Though we can categorise resources in various ways, they also have certain 
similarities. The following are some characteristics of resources.
(i)	 Utility : ‘Utility’ means the importance or usefulness of a resource in 

helping one to achieve a goal. Whether or not a resource has utility

Management of Resources

Activity 1

Think of your own self and make a list of the human resources you have. Use the 
following guidelines to reflect on this. 
•	 Knowledge – which areas are you knowledgeable about 
•	 Motivation/interest – what activities do you enjoy doing most
•	 Skills/strengths/aptitude – what are you particularly good at doing
•	 Time – which periods of the day are you most active 
•	 Energy – Do you largely feel energetic or tasteless/tired?  

depends on the goal and the situation. For example, cow dung is 
considered waste. However, it can be used as a fuel and can also be 
used to prepare humus (manure). Proper use of important resources 
available to a family or community leads to greater satisfaction. 

 (ii)	Accessibility : First, certain resources are more easily available as 
compared to others. Second, resources may be more easily available to 
some people as compared to others. Third, the availability of resources 
changes over time. Thus, we can say that accessibility of resources 
varies from person to person and from time to time.  For example, every 
family has money as a resource. While some have sufficient money to 
meet their needs, others have limited budgets. The amount of available 51

money is also different during the beginning of a month as compared 
to towards the end of the month.

(iii)	Interchangeability : Almost all the resources have substitutes. If one 
resource is not available, it can be substituted by another. For example, 
if your school bus does not arrive on time to pick you up, you can go 
to school in your car, tractor, bullock cart or scooter. Thus, the same 
function can be performed by a number of resources. 

(iv)	Manageable : Resources can be managed. Since resources are limited, 
they should be managed properly and effectively for their optimum 
utilisation. Resources should be used in such a way that we attain 
maximum output with minimum input of resources. For example, we 
should avoid using two-three buckets of water to wash clothes if we 
can wash them using one bucket.

Managing Resources 

It is important to note that none of the resources are unlimited. All 
resources are finite. We need to utilise resources effectively to achieve our 
goals faster and efficiently. Resources, therefore, should not be misused 
and wasted. Thus, to achieve our goals, effective management of resources 
is extremely essential.

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part I

Managing resources is about getting the most from the resources which 
are available to us. For example, everybody has 24 hours in a day. While 
some plan their schedule everyday and utilise every hour to achieve their 
goals, others waste their time and are not able to do anything productive 
the entire day. 

Management of resources involves implementing resource management 
procedures which include planning, organising, implementing, controlling 
and evaluation. We will read about these in detail in the following section.

The Management Process

As stated above, the management process involves five aspects – planning, 
organising, implementing, controlling and evaluation. 

(a)	Planning: It is the first step in any management process. It helps us 
to visualise the path to reach our goals. In other words, to plan is to 
produce a scheme for action to achieve specified goals by using the 
available resources. 

	 	 Planning involves selecting the course of action. To plan effectively 
to achieve a goal, you must ask the following four basic questions. The 

52 answers to these questions will help you to develop a plan.
1.	 What is our present situation?  This involves assessing the present 

situation, analysing what one has at present and what one would 
like to have in future. 

2.	 Where do we want to reach?  This involves setting specific goals or 
targets which we desire to achieve keeping in mind the present and 
future needs.

3.	 Gap. This is the difference between our present situation and the 
desired situation. We need to cover this gap in order to achieve our 
goal.   

4.	 How can we reach our desired goals? Answering this question will 
help you to decide how to cover this gap. This involves making a 
plan to achieve goals.

Management of Resources

•	 Steps in planning : The basic steps in planning are–
1.	 Identifying the problem
2.	 Identifying different alternatives
3.	 Choosing between alternatives
4.	 Acting to carry out the plan/Putting the plan into action  
5.	 Accepting the consequences

	 	 For example, there is only one month left for your annual examination 
and you have not completed your revision (present situation); your aim 
is to score good marks (goal). To achieve this goal you need to study five 
subjects in the specified time period (gap). You would think of a way 
of achieving this goal (prepare a plan of action), which will include the 
number of hours you will devote to each subject, prioritising subjects, 
curtailing other activities and so on. 

Activity 2

List the resources you would need in order to secure good marks and study well. 
Compare your list with others.

(b)	Organising: It is collecting and arranging appropriate resources in 
order to implement plans in an effective and efficient manner. If we take 
the above example, you would organise and arrange all the resources 
which you may require to study and secure good marks. 

Some resources could include books, notes, space to study, light, 
stationery, energy and time. 
(c)	 Implementing: This stage involves carrying out the prepared plan. In 

the above example, you would put the plan into action by starting to 
study from the available resources (e.g., books, stationary, notes, etc.).

(d)	Controlling: It refers to the task of ensuring that your activities are 
producing the desired results. In other words, the plan you have put 
into action is getting the desired results. Controlling helps monitor 
the outcome of activities and makes sure that the plans are being 
implemented correctly. It is important as it provides feedback and helps 
to check errors. Feedback helps you to revise your plan of action so 
you can achieve your goal. Therefore, while you are putting your study

plan into action, yet you are unable to complete your allotted chapter 
because you watch television, this gives you the feedback that you 
need to minimise your distractions.  You will not watch T.V., play or 
chat with friends during the study hours, as it can affect the outcome 
of your formulated plan (i.e., study as per the decided number of study 
hours). 

(e)	Evaluation: In the final stage, the outcomes that you have arrived at 
after putting your plan into action are evaluated. The end result of 
the task is compared with the desired result. All the limitations and 
the strengths of the task are noted so that they can be used in future 
to achieve one’s goals effectively. With reference to the example of 
studying, evaluation is what you do when you get back the checked 
answer sheets of the examination. You evaluate your marked answer 
sheets as per the preparation you had done for the examination and 
the results you had wanted to achieve. If the scores for any subject 
fall short of your expectations, you try to identify the reasons for the 
same. At the same time, you also try to find out your strengths which 
helped you to secure good marks in other subjects. Then you use these 
strengths to overcome your limitations to secure better marks in your 
next examination.  

54
In addition to the different resources discussed in this chapter, there 

are some other non-human resources that form an integral part of our daily 
living. One such resource is fabrics. The following chapter tells us about 
the various fabrics that we come into contact with and their properties.

Learning Objectives
 
After completing this chapter the learner will be able to —
•	 discuss the diversity in fabrics.
•	 name and classify the fabrics commonly seen around.
•	 explain the concept of yarn and fabric making.
•	 describe the properties of each group of fabrics. 57
•	 make informed selection of textile products for 	 	

specific end use.

5.1 Introduction 
Fabrics are all around us. They are an important part in our lives. Fabrics 
give comfort and warmth, bring colour and decorative style, and add 
texture. Just think of a day’s activity and recall how fabrics touch you. 
When you wake up from your bed, the bedsheets and pillow covers are 
fabrics. As you get ready for school the towel you use after bath is a soft 
and absorbent fabric, and the school dress you wear is again a fabric of a 
special type. The school bag in which you carry your books and other items 
is also a fabric, but again different in texture. It may be slightly stiff and 
coarse but strong enough to bear the load. If you observe your home you 
will find fabrics in almost all places, from curtains to kitchen dusters, floor 
mops and durries. Fabrics are of different kinds, weights and thickness 
and their choice is related to their end use. 

 If you take a typical fabric in hand, and unravel it, you may be able to 
pull out the thread like structures from it. These may be interlaced with 
each other at right angles or interlooped as in your woollen cardigan or        
T shirts, or knotted as in nets and laces. These are called yarns. If you 
try to untwist the yarn you will see very tiny and fine hair like structures.

Figure1: Fabric to Fibre

These are called fibres. Thus fibres are the basic building blocks of fabrics. 
All these materials — fibres, yarns and fabrics are called textile products 
or simply textiles. After the fabric is ready it may be subjected to further 
processing which may improve its appearance (cleaning, whitening, 
colouring) or make it more lustrous or improve its touch and feel qualities 
or improve its service ability. This is called finishing. A large variety of 
fabrics are available in the market these days and each one behaves 

58 differently when in use. The behaviour of the fabric in use and in care and 
maintenance depends on various factors such as type of fibre, yarn, fabric 
and finishing.

Activity 1

Collect different kinds of fabric samples from home, a tailor’s shop, a cloth shop or 
friends. Name each fabric.

5.2	 Fibre properties 
The properties of fibre contribute to the properties of the final fabric. For a 
fibre to be really important and useful, it must be available in large quantities 
and be economical. The most essential property is its spinnability, i.e., a 
characteristic which is essential for ease of conversion into yarn and later 
into fabric. It is the sum together of properties such as length, strength, 
flexibility and surface structure of the fibre. From the point of view of 
consumer satisfaction, properties such as colour, luster, weight, moisture 
and dye absorption and elasticity are desired. Factors that affect care and 
maintenance of the fabric such as abrasion resistance, effect of chemicals, 
soaps and detergents, effect of heat, and resistance to biological organism 
are also important to the user.

Fabrics Around Us

5.3	 Classification of textile fibres
Textile fibres can be classified on the basis of their origin (natural or 
man-made or manufactured), general chemical type (cellulosic, protein or 
synthetic), generic types (animal hair or animal secretion) and common 
trade name (polyester, as terene or dacron). Further, fibres can be  
staple, i.e., short length like cotton, or filament, i.e., long length like silk, 
polyester, etc. 

Natural Fibres

Natural fibres are those which are available to us in nature. There are 
four types of natural fibres.
(a)	Cellulosic fibres—
	 1.	 Seed hair-cotton, kapok
	 2.	 Bast fibres-flax(linen), hemp, jute
	 3.	 Leaf fibres-pineapple, agave(sisal)
	 4.	 Nut husk fibres-coir(coconut)
(b)	 Protein fibres 
	 1.	 Animal hair–wool, specially hair (goat, camel), fur
	 2.	 Animal secretion–silk 59

(c)	 Mineral fibre:  Asbestos 
(d)	Natural rubber

Manufactured Fibres (also called man-made fibres)

Most of you must have seen a cotton flower with fibres sticking to the 
seeds, or sheep with long overgrown hair. You can also imagine how these 
may be used for yarn and fabric production. However, you may find it 
difficult to understand how the manufactured or synthetic fibres came to 
exist. 

The first manufactured fibre–Rayon–was commercially produced in  
AD 1895, while most others are products of the 20th century.

The concept of creating fibres perhaps originated from human desire to produce a 
fibre like silk. Possibly, the thought process could have been like this: the silk worm, 
which basically feeds on mulberry leaves, digests them and spews a liquid through its 
spinnerettes (two holes), which on solidifying becomes the silk filament (cocoon). Thus 
if a cellulose substance is digested it should be possible to produce something like silk. 
Therefore for a long time the rayons were referred to as Artificial Silk or simply Art Silk.

The earliest manufactured fibres were made by modifying a non-fibrous 
material into a fibrous form. These were mainly from cellulosic substances

like cotton waste or wood pulp. The second group of fibres were synthesised 
completely from use of chemicals. Whatever may be the raw material the 
basic steps for converting it into a fibrous form are the same.
•	 The solid raw materials are 

converted into a liquid form of 
a specific viscosity. This may 
be due to a chemical action, 
dissolution, heat application or 
a combination action. This is 
called the spinning solution.

•	 This solution is passed through 
a spinnerette – a small thimble 
shaped nozzle with a series 
of very small holes, into an 
atmosphere which hardens 
it or coagulates it into fine 
filaments. 

•	 As the filaments harden they 
are collected and stretched 
for further fineness and 

60 orientation or subjected  
to further processing like Figure 2: Spinnerettes

stretch and/or bulk characteristics.

Fabrics Around Us

5.4	 Yarns
The textiles in the form of fibres cannot always be used for consumer 
products except in products like surgical cotton, stuffing for pillows, quilts, 
mattresses and cushions. To convert fibres into fabric form as we see 
around us, they have to be converted into a continuous strand. Although 
there are some fabrics like felts or non-wovens which are made directly 
from fibres, in most cases the fibres are processed to an intermediate stage 
called yarn. 

Yarn can be defined as a continuous strand of textile fibres, filaments or 
material in a form suitable for knitting, weaving or otherwise intertwining 
to form a textile fabric. 

Yarn Processing

Yarn processing from natural staple fibres is called spinning, although 
spinning is the last stage in the processing. 
Earlier young unmarried girls were commonly involved in spinning the finest yarn 
because of their nimble fingers. The term ‘spinster’ for unmarried women originated in 
that context.
Yarn processing, i.e., conversion of fibre into a yarn involves a number of 61
stages.

Let us take them one by one.
  (i)	Cleaning: Natural fibres generally contain extraneous impurities 

depending upon their source, like seeds or leafy matter in cotton, twigs 
and suint in wool. These are removed, fibres sorted out and converted 
into laps (rolled sheets of loose fibres).

 (ii)	Making into a sliver: Laps are unrolled and subjected to straightening 
processes which are carding and combing. The process is similar to 
combing and brushing your hair. Carding disentangles the fibres and 
lays them straight and parallel to one another. For finer fabrics the 
laps are subjected to combing after carding. This process removes 
finer impurities and short fibres as well. The lap then passes through 
a funnel shaped device which helps to convert it into a sliver. Sliver is 
a rope like mass of loose fibres, 2-4 cms in diameter. 

(iii)	Attenuating, drawing out and twisting: Now that the fibres have 
been converted into a continuous strand, it needs to be made to the 
size required. This is called attenuation. Several slivers are combined 
for uniformity. The slivers are gradually drawn out so that they become 
longer and finer. If a blended yarn is required (e.g., cotswol-cotton 
and wool) slivers from different fibres are combined at this stage. The 
resultant sliver is still of the same size as the original sliver.

 		  The sliver after drawing is taken to the roving machine where it is 
further attenuated till it becomes 1   1

         of its original diameter. It is given

a slight twist to keep the fibres together. The next stage is spinning. 
Here the strand is given the final shape as the yarn. It is stretched to 
the required fineness and the desired amount of twist given to it and 
wound on cones.

 
Figure 3: Cotton spinning

	 	 All manufactured fibres are first made as filaments. The yarn can be 
composed of a single filament or a multifilament yarn when a number 
of individual filaments are taken together and twisted as one. It is also 
possible to cut the filament into staple length fibres. These are then 
subjected to spinning process as for natural fibres and are called spun 
yarns. Staple length fibres are also required when a mixed fabric/
blend like ‘terecot’ (terene and cotton) or ‘terewool’ (terene and wool) or 
‘polycot’ (rayon and cotton) is required.

62

 Yarn Terminology 

(a)	Yarn number: You may have seen certain numbers 20, 30, 40, etc., 
on the labels of thread reels. If you observe carefully and compare the 
fineness of the thread you will realise that thread reel with a higher 
number is finer. There is a fixed relationship between the weight of the 
fibre and the length of yarn drawn from it. This is designated as yarn 
number which becomes the indication of the fineness of the yarn. 	

(b)	Yarn twist: As fibres are transformed into yarn, twist is added to hold 
the fibres together and is indicated as t.p.i. (twist per inch). Loosely 
twisted yarns are softer and more lustrous, whereas tightly twisted 
yarns may show as ridges such as in denim material of jeans. 

(c)	Yarn and thread: Yarn and thread are basically similar. Yarn is the 
term usually used in the manufacturing of a fabric, whereas, thread 
indicates a product used to join pieces of fabrics together. 

5.5	 Fabric production	
There are many types of fabric available in the market. Variation in different 
fabrics is due to the basic fibre content (cotton, wool, e.g.) or as you have 
just learnt, the type of yarn. When you look at the fabrics you may be able 
to distinguish between different structures as well.

Fabrics Around Us

We will now discuss how these fabrics are produced. Most of the fabrics 
you see are made from yarns. However, a small group of fabrics can be 
made directly from fibres.

There are two main types of Activity 2
fabrics that are made directly from 
fibres–felts and non-wovens or Try and note the difference between the 
bonded fibre fabrics. These fabrics structure of the material of your shirt or 
are formed by laying the fibre (after dress, pant/jeans, towel, socks, shoe 
carding and combing) in the form of laces, floor covering felts (namdas) and 
a matt and then adhesion is caused carpets. 
between them. The matt can be made 
not only of required thickness but also of any shape. 

As already mentioned, the majority of fabric constructions require the 
intermediate yarn stage. The main methods of fabric construction are 
weaving and knitting and to a small extent braiding and knotting.

Weaving

Weaving is the oldest form of textile art, which was originally used for making 
mats and baskets. A woven fabric consists of two sets of yarns which are 
interlaced at right angles to each other, to form a compact construction. It is 63
done on machines called looms. One set of yarns is fitted on the loom, which 
determines the length and width of the fabric to be woven. These are called 
warp yarns. The loom helps to maintain these yarns at a fixed tension and 
even space. The second yarn, which is the filling yarn, is then interlaced to 
form the fabric. The simplest interlacing is when the filling yarn moves over 
and under one warp yarn alternately in one row and 
reverses the process in the second row. By passing the 
filling yarn over and under different number of warp 
yarns, in a specified sequence, different designs can 
be created. Attachments like the dobby or jacquard to 
the loom can help to create figurative designs as well. 
These designs become clearer when different coloured 
yarns are used for warp and filling. Certain designs 
make use of an extra yarn which may run parallel to 
warp or filling yarns. This can be held up as loops 
during weaving, which may be left uncut or cut afterwards. This makes the 
texture like one sees in towels (uncut) or velvets and corduroy (cut). 

The direction of the yarns in a woven fabric is referred to as grain. 
Warp yarns run along the length wise grain or selvedge. Filling yarns run 
along the width wise grain or weft. Thus the length and width in a woven 
fabric is called the selvedge and weft. When you buy a fabric, you see it has 
two cut sides and two bound sides. The bound sides are the selvedges. The 
fabric is strongest along the selvedge.

Knitting 

Knitting is the interlooping of atleast one set of yarns. It may be done by 
hand using a set of two needles for flat fabrics or a set of four needles for 
circular fabrics. Knitting may be done on machines. The process consists 
of making a series of loops along the knitting needle or machine bed. Each 
successive row is formed by interlooping with the first row of loops. The 
movement of the yarn is along the width of the material and therefore it is 
called filling or weft knitting. This method of knitting is used to produce 
articles which can be shaped while being constructed. 

At the industrial level, the knitting machines used are like the looms 
for weaving.   They have a set of yarns (like warp yarns) fitted on the 
machine. The interlooping occurs with adjacent yarns. This is known as 
warp knitting. This can produce continuous lengths of material, which 
unlike the weft knitted fabric can be cut and stitched.

Knitted fabrics can be made more rapidly. Because of the system of 
loops they have more elasticity and thus are suitable for fitted articles like 
vests, underwear, socks, etc. They are porous and permit free circulation 
of air, are comfortable and allow freedom of movement and are therefore 
ideally suited for sportswear. 

Braiding 

Braided fabrics have a diagonal surface effect and are made by plaiting 
three or more yarns that originate from a single location and lie parallel 
before interlacing occurs. Braids appear in items as shoelaces, ropes, 
insulation for wires and trimmings.

Fabrics Around Us

Nets 

Nets are open mesh fabrics with large geometric interstices between the 
yarns. These are made by inter-knotting of yarns by hands or machines.

Laces 

Lace is an openwork fabric consisting of a network of yarns formed into 
intricate designs. It is a product of a combination of procedures including 
yarn twisting, interloping and knotting. 

5.6	 Textile Finishing
If you see the fabric as it comes out from the loom you will not be able to 
recognise it as the material you see in the market. All of the fabrics that 
are available in the market have received one or more finishing treatments, 
and except for whites, colour has been added to them in some form or the 
other. 

A finish is any treatment on 
the fabric which can change its Activity 3
appearance, its textures or its 65
behaviour for specific use. Finishes Collect five labels of fabrics. Match the 
that are considered absolutely information with what you have just read.
necessary are known as ‘routine’. 
The finishes may be durable (do not 
get removed on washing or drycleaning) like dyeing, or renewable (need to 
be applied repeatedly as they get removed on washing) like starching or 
blueing. A few important finishes depending upon their functions are: 
•	 Change appearance : Cleaning (scouring, bleaching),   straightening 

and smoothening (calendering and tentering)
•	 Change textures: Starching or sizing, special calendering
•	 Change behaviour : Wash and wear, permanent press, water repellent 

or water proof, mothproof, flame retardant or fire proof, antishrink 
(sanforisation). 

(a)	Finishing with colour: Colour is often the most important factor in 
selection of fabric, whether it is to be used for apparel or in the house. 
Substances that can add colour to the fabric in a manner that it does 
not easily wash out are known as dyes. The method of dying depends 
on the chemical natures of the fibre and the dye, and the type of effect 
desired. Colour application can be done: 
•	 at fibre stage – for yarns of different colours or designed felts.
•	 at yarn stage – for woven checks, stripes or other woven patterns.

•	 at fabric stage – the most common method for solid colour dye, as 
also for designed dying like batik and tie and dye and printing.

(b)	Printing: It is a more advanced or specialised form of dyeing. It involves 
the localised application of colour which is restricted within the given 
limits of design. Printing uses special tools which cause the transfer of 
colour only to the specified areas. Thus, it allows the application of a 
number of different colours on the fabric. Printing can be done by hand 
tools like blocks, stencils or screens and at industrial level like roller 
printing or automatic screen printing. 

5.7	 Some important fibres

 Cotton 

Cotton is the most widely used fibre for apparel and home textiles. India 
is the first country where cotton was grown and used, and it continues to 
be one of the largest cotton growing areas. Cotton fibres are obtained from 
the seed pod of the cotton plant. Each seed has a large number of hair 
attached to it. When the seeds ripen the pod bursts open. The seeds are 

66 separated from the fibres by a process called ginning and sent as large 
bundles (bales) for spinning. 
Properties 
•	 Cotton is a natural cellulosic, staple fibre. It is the shortest fibre with 

length varying from 1 cm to 5 cms, therefore the yarn or the fabric 
made is dull in appearance and slightly rough to touch. It is heavier in 
weight than most of the other fibres.

•	 Cotton has good moisture absorbency and it also dries easily. Thus it 
is comfortable for summer use. 

•	 It is available in fabrics of all types of weights, fineness, structures and 
finishes. Muslin, cambric, poplin, long cloth (latha), casement, denim, 
sheeting material and furnishing material are some of the cotton fabrics 
available in the market. 

Linen

Linen is a bast fibre, obtained from the stems of the flax plant. The term 
bast means the fleshy part inside the bark. To obtain the fibres the stems 
are steeped in water for a long time to rot away the soft parts, in a process 
called retting. After retting the woody parts are separated and the linen 
fibres are collected and sent for spinning. 
Properties
•	 Linen is also a cellulosic fibre, therefore, many of its properties are 

similar to that of cotton.

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 1.indd   66 8/4/2022   2:50:53 PM



Fabrics Around Us

•	 The fibre is longer and finer than cotton, so the yarn produced is 
stronger and more lustrous.

•	 Like cotton, linen also absorbs moisture readily and, therefore, is 
comfortable. However, it does not absorb dyes very readily and therefore 
colours produced are not so bright. 
Flax plant is cultivated in very few areas worldwide. Also it requires 

longer processing time, therefore, linen is used less than cotton.
Jute and Hemp are also bast fibres like Linen. They are coarser fibres 

and do not have good flexibility, and are therefore used for making ropes, 
gunny bags and other such products. 

Wool

Wool is obtained from sheep hair. It can also be obtained from other 
animals like goats, rabbits and camels. These fibres are called speciality 
hair fibres. Different breed of sheep provide different types of hair. Some 
breeds are raised only for good quality of fibres they produce. Removal of 
hair from the animal is called shearing. It may be done once or twice a 
year depending on the climatic conditions. While shearing, effort is made 
to keep the hair in one piece which is called fleece. This makes the sorting 
of fibres easy because hair from different parts of the body vary in length 67
and fineness. After sorting, the fibres are scoured to get rid of dirt, grease 
and dried perspiration. This is followed by carbonisation which removes 
entangled vegetable matter like leaves and twigs. Thereafter, the fibres are 
sent for spinning.
Properties
•	 Wool is a natural protein fibre. The fibres vary in length from 4 cms 

to 40 cms and may be coarse or fine depending on the breed of the 
sheep and the part of the animal body. It is characterised by a natural 
crimp or a built-in waviness responsible for elasticity and elongation 
properties.

•	 Compared to other fibres wool has low strength but has good resilience, 
and elastic recovery.

•	 Wool has surface scales which are water repellant in nature. However, 
it can absorb large amount of water but does not feel wet on the 
surface. This ability is responsible for its comfort in humid and cold 
atmospheres. 
Wool is also used as blends with cotton, rayon and polyester, which 

improves its care and maintenance properties.

Silk

Silk is a natural filament fibre produced by the secretion of silk worms. If 
silk is produced in controlled conditions (cultivated or mulberry silk), it is 
smooth, and longer fibres are produced which results in a smoother, finer 
and lustrous fabric. If silk is produced in wild or natural conditions, the 
resulting silk is coarser, stronger and short in length, which results in a 
thicker, coarser but stronger fabric (e.g., tussar silk). For production of 
good quality silk, silk worm cultivation is carefully controlled. It is called 
sericulture. Being a filament fibre silk does not require the spinning 
process but has to be reeled carefully from the cocoon. The yarns are made 
by twisting a number of filaments together. If the filaments break or when 
the insects break the cocoon, the broken filaments are processed through 
spinning like cotton, and this is called spun silk. 

It is believed that silk was discovered accidentally when the cocoon of 
an insect fell in the cup of tea of a Chinese princess. She took it out and 
discovered that she could pull out a long continuous filament from the 
cocoon. The Chinese kept the art of producing silk a secret for over 2000 
years—until about 500 A.D. 
Properties

68 •	 Silk is a natural protein fibre and the natural colour of silk is off white 
to cream. Wild silk is brownish in colour. Silk filaments are very long, 
fine, smooth and have a relatively high lustre or sheen. It contains a 
natural gum which gives silk a crisp texture. 

•	 Silk is one of the stronger fibres used in making fabrics. It has good 
elastic recovery and moderate elongation. 

Rayon

This is a manufactured cellulosic fibre. Cellulosic because it is made from 
wood pulp and manufactured because this wood pulp is treated with 
chemicals and regenerated into fibres. 
Properties
•	 As rayon is a manufactured fibre the size and shape can be controlled. 

It has uniform diameter and is clear and lustrous. 
•	 Rayon being a cellulosic fibre has most properties like cotton. But it 

has a lower strength and durability. 
The main advantage of rayon and manufactured cellulosic fibres is that 

they can be reprocessed out of waste material and have an appearance like 
silk.

Nylon

Nylon was the first true synthetic fibre (totally manufactured from 
chemicals)  to be manufactured. It was first introduced as bristles for tooth 
brushes. In 1940, the first fabrics from Nylon were socks and stocking 
which were very successful. Thereafter, it was used for all kinds of fabrics. 
It also provided the impetus for other synthetic fibres which followed. 
Properties
•	 Nylon filaments are usually smooth and shiny, with uniform diameter. 
•	 Nylon has very good strength and abrasion resistance. Its resistance to 

abrasion makes it appropriate to be used in brushes, carpets, etc. 
•	 Nylon is a highly elastic fibre. Very fine and transparent fibres are used 

for ‘one-size’ garments like stockings.
•	 Nylon is a popular fabric used in apparel, socks, undergarments, 

swimsuits, gloves, nets, sarees, etc. It is a leading fibre in the 
manufacture of hosiery and lingerie. For outerwear it may be blended 
with other fibres.

Polyester

Polyester is another manufactured synthetic fibre. It is also referred to as 69
Terylene or Terene.
Properties
•	 Polyester fibre has uniform diameter, smooth surface and rod like 

appearance. It can be made in any strength, length and diameter as 
per the requirements of the end use. The fibre is partially transparent 
and lustrous.

•	 The moisture regain of polyester is very low, i.e., it does not absorb 
water easily. Thus, it is not very comfortable to wear in hot dry summer 
months. 

•	 The most advantageous property of polyster is its wrinkle resistance. It 
is one of the most commonly used fibre for blending with rayon, cotton 
and wool and, to some extent, spun silk. 

Acrylic

This is another synthetic fibre. It resembles wool so much that even an 
expert may not be able to find the difference between the two. It is commonly 
called as Cashmilon.  It is cheaper than wool. 
Properties
Like all manufactured fibres the length, diameter and fineness of the 
fibre are controlled by the manufacturer. The fibre can be made in varied 
degrees of crimp and luster.

•	 Acrylic is not very strong and its strength is similar to cotton. The 
fibres have high elongation with good elastic recovery.
Acrylic is used as a substitute for wool and is used in children’s wear, 

apparels, blankets and knitted goods.	

 Elastomeric fibres

Apart from the fibres mentioned so far, there are a few less known ones. 
These are elastic, rubbers like substances and can be produced in various 
forms. In its natural form they include rubber and the synthetic equivalent 
is spandex or Lycra. These are usually used as blends with any of the 
above fibres with low elasticity. 

Having studied about fabrics in this chapter, you will be introduced 
to the world of apparel, i.e., clothes, made from fabrics later under the 
section ‘Childhood’.

Knowing about fabrics is important for the adolescent as it would 
enable one to make wise selection of clothes – an interest that is commonly 
shared by all adolescents. Apart from clothes, another interest that binds 
adolescents from different contexts is media and communication. Let us

technology

Communication is very basic and vital for human survival and has existed 
since the inception of life on earth. In modern times, with fast developing 
technologies, new communication methods and gadgets are introduced in 
the market almost every week. Some of these have become more popular 
due to their cost effectiveness and utility, and have sustained over time.

Media and Communication Technology

 What is communication?

Communication is the process of thinking, observing, understanding, 
analysing, sharing, and transmitting or transferring feelings to others 
through a variety of mediums in diverse settings. It also refers to seeing 
or watching, listening or hearing, and exchanging ideas, thoughts, 
experiences, facts, knowledge, impressions, moments, emotions, and the 
like with self or with others. 

As the name suggests, the word communication stems from the 
Latin word communis meaning common. It is therefore, not only sharing 
of ideas, thoughts or imparting knowledge and information, but it also 
involves understanding the exact meaning of the content in a way that 
is common to both, the communicator and the receiver. Thus, effective 
communication is a conscious effort in creating a shared understanding 
about the intended meaning of the message among people involved in 
the communication. The process of communication is continuous and 
permeates all areas of social life, including home, school, community  
and beyond.     

Classification of Communication
75

Communication can be classified on the basis of the following depending 
on the levels, types, forms and modes.

A. Classification based on the type of interaction 
(i) One-way communication: In such 

What 
situations the receiver receives 

a bogus

respond immediately. Therefore, T.V.
communication remains one–way. 
Speeches, lectures, sermons, listening 
to music on the radio or a music 
system, watching any entertainment }
programmes on television, using 
internet to search information on Joseph

a website, etc., are examples of  
one-way communication.

(ii)	Two-way communication: This is comm-unication that takes place 
between two or more persons where all the parties communicating with 
each other share or exchange ideas, thoughts, information, etc., either

mother in response. The cry of the baby 

Zubeda Samara is the message that communicates the 
hunger of the child and is vital for the 

survival of the baby. Thus, in this case the communication is two-way.
B. Classification based on the levels of communication
(i)	 Intra-personal communication: This refers to communicating with 

oneself. This is a form 
of mental process 
involving observing, 
analysing, and drawing

can be used for this type of communication. Examples are talking to 
your friend about difficulties faced while studying or conducting an 
experiment or participating in a panel discussion followed by question-
answer session.

	 	 Inter-personal communication is the most effective and ideal type 
of communication for two reasons. First, there is always proximity 
and direct contact between the communicatee and the communicator, 
and therefore it is easy to persuade, motivate and convince the 
communicatee for acceptance of the introduced idea or thought. 
Second, instantaneous and strong feedback with direct response of 
communicatee on the introduced idea is possible.   

(iii)	Group Communication: This form of communication is direct and 
personal, such as inter-personal communication, but with the 
involvement of more than two persons in the communication process. 
Group communication helps to facilitate a participatory approach and 
collective decision-making, gives an opportunity for self-expression, and 
increases the individual’s impact in a gathering, thereby augmenting 
one’s status in the group. It also helps in recreation and relaxation, 
socialising and motivating. A range of audio-visual aids may be used to 
enhance group communication. 

(iv)	Mass Communication:  As a result of considerable advancement in 77

technology, making thoughts, ideas and innovations reach the larger 
section of society has become possible. Mass communication can be 
defined as the process of multiplying messages with the help of any 
mechanical device and disseminating the same to the masses.  The 
means and media of mass communication are radio, TV, satellite 
communication, newspapers, and magazines. The audiences of mass 
communication are very large in size, heterogeneous and anonymous, 
spread over a large area and separated from the communicator in 
terms of time and space. For these reasons it is not possible to take a 
correct, complete, direct and immediate feedback; rather there is slow, 
cumulative, expensive, and delayed feedback. 

 (v)	Intra-organisational Communication: Organisational communication 
takes place in highly structured settings. Just like human beings, when 
people work together in an organisation, organisations also establish 
and maintain relationships. They use various levels of communication 
within their environment and amongst their departments or sections. 
Every organisation has different levels or hierarchy of ranks working 
together for achieving common goals. The information flow in such 
organisations is expected to be two-way at the same level and one-way 
across levels.

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part I

(vi)	Inter-organisational Communication: This refers to the communication 
system developed by one organisation to communicate with other 
organisations with the aim of working in cooperation and coordination 
with each other. For example, for assistance in developmental activities 
of the country, both technical and financial support is provided by 
international agencies, whereas, administrative support is given by the 
Central government and State governments.

It is important to note that in both inter-organisational and inter-organisational set-
ups, communication does not take place among the departments or organisations; 
rather it is always human beings working in these organisations who communicate 
with each other. Therefore, understanding of the human factor is very important.

C. Classification based on the means or modes of communication
 (i) 	Verbal communication:  Auditory means or verbal modes like speaking, 

singing and sometimes even the tone of voice, etc., are of significance 
in verbal communication. 

		  Research shows that on an average, an individual spends about 
70 per cent of her/his active time in communicating verbally, i.e., 
listening, speaking and reading aloud.

(ii)	Non-Verbal Communication: Non-verbal means of communication are 
gestures, facial expressions, disposition, posture, eye contact, touch, 
para-language, writing, clothing, hair styles, and even architecture, 
symbols and sign language such as smoke signals used by some  
tribal people. 

		
D. Classification based on the involvement of number of human senses
Have you ever tried to know why learning about our rich traditional 
heritage by simply watching folk or classical dance performance live or on 
television makes it easy to understand and more interesting than reading 
about them in a book?

Communication is the process of transferring information or content 

80 from a sender to a receiver with the use of a medium. It involves flexibility 
to exchange information using several methods in which the information is 
correctly, clearly and completely understood by both sender and receiver. 
It also takes the feedback of the audience on the message sent for further 
planning in the same way as carrying out market surveys before launching 
a product in the market.

Let us see the sequence in which the communication events occur. 
One way to describe it is as follows: Who says, what, to whom, when, in 
what manner, under what circumstances and with what effect. The 
basic elements of any communication process in general are arranged in 
a definite order to complete the cycle. Six elements have to be handled 
skillfully for effective and successful communication and can be easily 
understood by “The SMCRE Model” of communication.

The SMCRE model (Figure 2) shows the complete process of communication 
and the elements involved in it.
1.	 Source: It is the person who initiates the process of communication.  

She/he is the key factor responsible for the effectiveness of the whole 
communication process. She/he gives the message to a specific 
group of audience in such a manner that it not only results in correct 
interpretation of the message 
but also yields the desired 
response. She/he could be Activity 2

a farmer or a tribal person 
from a remote area of the 
country possessing indigenous 
knowledge. 

2.	 Message: It is the content or information a communicator wishes to 
receive, accept or act upon. It could be any technical, scientific or simply 
generalised information or ideas, specific or general to any field of 
knowledge or day-to-day life of 
an individual, group or even a 81

for the channels selected and 
the nature and type of the  
receiver group. 

3.	 Channel: The medium of communication through which the information 
flows from a sender to one or two receivers is a channel. Face-to-face, 
word-of-mouth is the simplest and one of the most effective means 
of communication. It is perhaps the most widely used medium of

There can be two types of channels:
 (i)	Inter - personal communication channels such as individuals and 

groups.
(ii)	Mass media communication channels, e.g., satellite, wire-less and 

sound waves.
4.	 Receiver: It is the intended audience of the message or the target of

are the chances of successful 
communication.  

5.	 Effect of communication (feedback): A communication process is 
incomplete unless the response to the message is received. It is the 
initiating step as well as the terminating element in any communication 
process. Termination occurs when the response to the message is the 
same as expected. In such a situation, since the objective is achieved, 
the cycle is complete. However, if the response of the intended audience 

82 does not yield the desired results, rethinking and recasting of message 
occurs and the entire communication process is repeated. Here are 
a few examples: (a) When a teacher has taught a lesson, at the end 
she/he asks the students questions to find out if the lesson has 
been understood. The activity of asking questions and finding out 
what themes and parts were understood and which topics need to be 
explained again is a feedback. (b) Letters from readers in newspapers 
and magazines are a form of feedback to the editor and writers. (c) The  
ratings Television Rating Points (TRPs) of a television programme are 
another form of feedback from viewers.

6.2	 What is Media? 
If you listen to the radio or watch television, perhaps you are aware that 
what you hear or see influences you in one way or the other. That is media 
influence. Let us see how the media influences us.

Identify the most common element in the following: Advertisements 
and  programmes we see on television, films on TV or theatre, the news we 
read in the newspapers, the speech of a politician, instructions imparted 
by the teacher in the classroom, or a complaint that is registered when 
an appliance is not functioning well, or shopping through internet sitting  
at home.

Media and Communication Technology

You will find that the common element in all these is that some or 
the other medium has been used to pass on or share varied messages 
or information across diverse fields. For instance, when we talk to  
someone or hear someone talking, it is the air that acts as a medium 
through which the sound waves travel since no sound can be transmitted 
in a vacuum.

Therefore, if communication is a process, media is the means that uses 
various methods of communication for disseminating and sharing, 
ideas, thoughts, feelings, innovations experiences, etc. Mass media 
essentially uses modern technology for communication but the presence 
of technology does not always denote that mass communication is taking 
place. Mass media is always meant for heterogeneous, anonymous and 
large audience groups. 

Does media mean only radio, and TV? No, all types of satellite 
transmission, computer and wireless technology are also included in it. 
Media has gone through a lot of change and development. Now numerous 
modern technologies are available as media for communication purpose. 

Media classification and functions

Media can be classified into two broad categories, traditional and modern 83
media.

Traditional media: Till very recently most rural extension 
work was completely dependent on traditional media such as fairs 
and radio. The situation is no different even today. Inter-personal 
communication media largely remains the most used and effective 
medium of communication in rural and remote areas. Examples of 
other traditional folk media are puppetry, folk dances, folk theatre, 
oral literature, fairs and festivals, rituals and symbols, print media 
such as charts, posters, newspapers, magazines, and other local 
publications from ancient times. Various traditional folk media are 
being used as indigenous channels of communication. Some very 
popular examples are – traditional folk theatre or drama like Jatra 
(Bengal), Ramleela and Nautanki (Uttar Pradesh), Bidesia (Bihar), 
Tamasha (Maharashtra), Yakshagana, Dashavatar (Karnataka) 
or Bhavai (Gujarat). Likewise various oral literature-cum-musical 
forms basically include folk or tribal songs and dances such as 
Baul and Bhatiali (Bengal), Sna and Dadaria (Madhya Pradesh), 
Duha and Garba (Gujarat), Chakri (Kashmir), Bhangra and Gidda 
(Punjab), Kajri, Chaiti (U.P.) and Allha (U.P. and Bihar), Powda and 
Lavni (Maharashtra), Bihu (Assam) and Mand, Panihari, and songs 
sung by Charans and Bhaatt (Rajasthan). There are various drum

Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part I

festivals with very rhythmic drum beats followed by dance and songs 
of the North-eastern and other tribal communities of the country.  
Different types of puppetry forms have also been common media 
for communicating messages along with providing entertainment. 
Among the most common are the string puppets or ‘Sutradharika’ 
mainly used in Rajasthan and Gujarat, and Chhaya Putli (shadow 
puppets) which are more common in the southern parts of the 
country. Besides, there are numerous festivals, fairs, social rituals 
and ceremonies, yatras, etc., for conveying messages, expressions, 
feelings and traditions of the diverse communities across the country.  

With changing times it became apparent that traditional communication 
media were neither sufficient nor well-equipped to meet the diverse 
information needs of the modern audiences. Hence, new media technologies 
have been popularised.

Modern media: With the advent of modern technology the range of 
communication media has expanded tremendously. New communication 
technologies, such as the mobile phone, are emerging with exciting features 
that have improved the quality and capacity of broadcast. The handy size 
of equipments has made them convenient for use in rural as well as remote 
areas. It has also increased the reach of modern communication technology. 

84 The availability of and access to computers, particularly the internet 
facility, has ushered a completely 
new era of communication media.

film and video conferencing are 
some examples of modern media. 

Functions of media: The previous chapters have made you aware 
that as an adolescent you are likely to be influenced by media. It has the 
following functions.
1.	 Information: It includes both, providing information and information 

exchange. These days information is power. Communication is 
facilitated through various media such as radio, television, magazines, 
newspapers.

2.	 Persuasion/Motivation: We are not always convinced about whatever 
idea or thought we come across. Suitable communication media can 
be used to persuade an audience to accept an idea. This needs a

deeper understanding of audience psychology and their socio-cultural 
background.  

3.	 Entertainment: Both, traditional and modern communication media 
provide a wide variety of entertainment options starting from folk 
media and oral tradition to Direct to Home (DTH) telecast. Even for 
educational purposes media is used in an entertaining form to make 
learning easy and interesting. 

4.	 Interpretation: Use of communication media, particularly pictographic 
presentations, and facts and figures make many difficult and complicated 
concepts easy to understand. For example, it is easy to locate and 
understand a geographical area with the help of a cartographic map or 
model of a globe than merely reading about it in a textbook.

5.	 Transmission of values: Media is expected to foster development of a 
healthy society by the transmission of wholesome values. For example, 
use of puppetry and cartoon films for teaching values through the story 
format that are attractive options.

6.	 Education or training: New learning experiences with the help of 
appropriate communication media in local language, and focussing on 
local problems always enrich the teaching–learning experience. These 
include interactive instruction video and audio cassettes, and discs of 
basic printed teaching-learning material on various concepts.   85

7.	 Coordination: Due to the introduction of modern interactive 
communication technologies, distance and physical proximity has 
become less important. Pace, scope and accuracy of communication 
has expanded to such an extent that it has now become very easy 
to sit in one place and coordinate large projects spread over a vast 
geographical area.

8.	 Behavioural change: All extension education activities related to varied 
fields, be it health, literacy, environmental issues, empowerment 
programmes and adoption of innovations depend largely on the art and 
technique of effective communication. Media remains the main vehicle 
for the transmission of useful messages, acceptance of which leads to 
direct and indirect behavioural change in the target people.  

9.	 Development: Media is a catalyst (medium) in national development. 
Communication mediates between specialists and lay persons. 
Thus, communication occupies a pivotal position in the process of 
development. Media has accelerated the pace of development and made 
the world smaller by bringing people closer through communication.

	 	 Both communication and media employ modern technology for 
reaching out to people. We will read about this in the next section.

6.3 What is communication technology?	  
The global scenario is passing through a communication revolution and 
communication technologies are changing very fast. What is new today 
may be obsolete tomorrow. People want to know everything in a very short 
span of time. There is information overflow and it is easily available and 
accessible to all through a wide variety of traditional and modern mediums. 
It is here that communication technology is playing a key role.

We have been using different mediums and communication technologies 
for communicating in different times (in the past and at present), 
in different settings, for example rural/urban/tribal.

distance is dead. What 

used to be far is near,

 Let us have a look around us. You may have observed that many new 
technologies related to electronic media have revolutionised communication 
media? 

Do you know that Pij village in Gujarat acquired the first TV transmitter 
in India, which provided programmes in local language along with 
common programmes from Delhi via satellite.

Media and Communication Technology

Communication technology refers to various technologies developed 
and used to handle information and aid communication. This includes 
modern technologies that are used to transmit data, which could either be 
analogue (electronic signals) or digital. There are hardware, organisational 
structures, as well as social values which individuals access to collect, 
process, and exchange information.  

Classification of communication technologies 

A wide range of communication technologies are available. These fall into 
two broad groups.

 (i) 	Cable (land) based technologies: These are comparatively cheap and 
less complicated. Landline telephone or a personal computer without 
internet are examples of such technology. 

(ii) 	Wireless technologies: These generally require less infrastructure, 
but can be more expensive 
to use than cable-based Activity 7
technologies. Some examples 
are radio, microwave and Participate in a group discussion in your 
satellite wireless telephony, or class on “Communication Technology – a 87
use of ‘bluetooth’ technology in curse or a boon?” 
mobile phones and computers.
Two significant communication technologies that acted as media 

and changed the whole communication scenario are the radio and  
the television.

Radio: Radio commands a universal audience by geographical spread, 
income, education, age, sex and religion. Through on-the-spot broadcast 
or simulated broadcast it can overcome the barriers of time and space. 
With the use of small size transistors it was made possible to receive 
communication in the remotest parts of the country.   

Television: TV was introduced in India in 1959 primarily to impact 
education and promote rural development. TV programmes are planned 
and produced using various techniques of visual magnification, sound 
amplification, super-imposition, split screen processes, fading, zooming, 
etc. These techniques make it more effective and strengthen the impact on 
the viewer.

Modern Communication Technologies  

The list of modern communication technologies is long and every other 
day we hear of innovation in the existing technology. Following are some 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 1.indd   87 8/4/2022   2:50:58 PM



Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part I

of the major types of modern communication technologies used primarily 
for extension purposes. 
1.	 Micro Computers: Computers are classified as mainframes  

(large and costly), mini computers (less powerful) and micro-computers 
(based on microchip technology). This classification is based on their 
power, speed of executing a set of instructions and the amount of 
memory available to store data as well as degree of inter connectivity 
that the computer offers. 

What is Bluetooth Technology?

Bluetooth Technology is a low-cost, short– Is it  a blue  
range radio frequency (RF) link between coloured tooth?
mobile PCs, mobile phones and other portable 
devices capable of transmitting voice and data 
at the rate of 1 Mbps, which is from three 
to eight times the average speed of parallel 
and serial ports, respectively. It can transmit through solid, 
non-metal objects.

88
	 It allows wireless control of and communication 
between a cell phone and a hands free head set or a 
car kit. 

	 	 The functions of micro-computer, particularly for extension 
work, include processing, keeping record of all kinds of information, 
performing accounting function, acting as repository of various 
cases, experiences to be used for research and field purpose in a very 
small space and publishing information material at reasonable cost. 
Computers can also communicate with each other if linked together 
and provide sourcing of information from across the globe.

2.	 Video text: Video text or view-data is an electronic text service 
transmitted from central computer to home TV–set via telephone 
network or cable system. It is interactive in the sense that the viewer 
has the option to access the desired data.

3.	 Electronic mail (E-mail): It is the system which passes information 
electronically from sender to receiver. E-mail system is like surface 
mail in which a message is typed on the computer and sent to another 
computer via the mobile phone. It is a simple way of communicating

Media and Communication Technology

between two or more persons through the provision of a mail box. 
The message is stored in the computer which acts as a post office, 
unless the receiver asks for it. The mail can be viewed using a modem 
connected to the telephone. 

4. Interactive video: Interactive video refers to a video system which is 
a combination of computer and video. It uses multi–media approach, 
i.e., text, still photographs, video, audio, slides, overheads, etc. The 
messages stored in different forms are received by the users as per 
their choice. The users’ response to the system determines the path to 
be followed. 

 5. Teleconferencing: Teleconferencing is interactive group communication. 
It refers to a system meant for creating dialogue between geographically 
dispersed participants and physically distant people. Advances in 
telecommunication have made it possible to hold meetings without 
travelling to long distances. 

Activity 8

Write any two messages that you remember from the hoardings displayed on road sides. 
Also write your interpretation of the messages:
•	 Message:  _______________________________________________________	 89

Interpretation:  ____________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________

•	 Message:  _______________________________________________________	
Interpretation:  ____________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________

Communication Technology thus greatly facilitates communication; 
more and more people across the world are using these technologies. Yet the 
human touch cannot be ignored. In our everyday lives we need to engage in 
face-to-face communication with different people. Every individual hence, 
needs to develop certain basic skills for effective communication. The next 
chapter on Effective Communication Skills, will help us understand this.

APPENDIX

Syllabus

Human Ecology and Family Sciences

(Classes XI-XII)
Rationale 
The curriculum in Human Ecology and Family Sciences (HEFS), formerly known 
as Home Science, has been framed keeping in view the principles of the National 
Curriculum Framework-2005 of the NCERT. Traditionally, the field of Home Science 
encompasses five areas, namely, Food and Nutrition, Human Development and 
Family Studies, Fabric and Apparel, Resource Management and Communication 
and Extension. All these domains have their specific content and focus that 
contribute to the study of the individual and the family in Indian socio-cultural 
context. The new curriculum has attempted to break away from the conventional 
framework of the discipline in significant ways. In the new conceptualisation, the 
boundaries between different areas of the discipline have been dissolved. This 
has been done to enable students to develop a holistic understanding of life in the 
home and outside. A special effort has been made to communicate respect for every 
student’s life at home and in society by making the curriculum appropriate for 
both boys and girls, living in different contexts, including those who are homeless. 
It has also been ensured that all the units address, in their content, the significant 
principles of equity, equality and inclusiveness. These include gender sensitivity, 
respect for diversity and plurality in relation to rural-urban-tribal location, caste, 
class, value for both traditional and modern influences, concern for society and 
pride in national symbols. Additionally, the novel approach has made concerted 
efforts, to integrate learning at school by building bridges with other subjects in 
the sciences and social sciences. 

The practicals have an innovative and contemporary character and reflect 
the utilisation of new technology and applications that would strengthen critical 
engagement with the lived realities of people. More specifically, there is a deliberate 
shift to field-based experiential learning. The practicals are designed to foster critical 
thinking. Further, conscious effort has been made to move away from stereotyped 
gender roles thus making the experiences more inclusive and meaningful for both 
boys and girls. It is imperative that the practicals are conducted keeping in mind 
the resources available with the family and community. 

The course adopts a developmental framework in Class XI using the life-span 
approach, starting with adolescence, the stage of development being experienced 
by the student. Beginning with one’s own stage of development would instill 
interest and enable identification with the physical and emotional changes that 
the student is undergoing. Following this is the study of childhood and adulthood. 
In each unit, the challenges and concerns have been addressed along with the 
activities and resources necessary to meet these challenges. 

Reprint 2025-26

Syllabus.indd   145 2/8/2023   14:30:41



For Class XI the ‘self and family’ and the ‘home’ are focal points for understanding 
the dynamics of individual lives and social interaction. The rationale for using 
this approach is that it will enable the adolescent student to understand herself/
himself in the context of the family, which in turn is nested within the wider 
Indian socio-cultural milieu.

For Class XII, the emphasis is on ‘work and careers’ through the life-span. 
In this context, work is perceived as essential human activity that contributes 
to the development and sustenance of individuals, families and society. Its value 
is not linked only to its economic ramifications. The student will be helped to 
explore the significance of work, jobs and careers and their interrelationship. To 
understand this concept, the student will be imparted life skills and work skills in 
the respective areas of HEFS. This will facilitate the acquisition of basic skills and 
orientation to advanced professional skills needed for specialisation in the selected 
fields discussed in the course. It is significant that these skills will be useful for 
the student in her/his personal-social life, as well as serve as a springboard for 
pursuing a career in the future. 

Objectives

The Human Ecology and Family Sciences curriculum has been framed to enable 
the learners to
1.	 develop an understanding of the self in relation to family and society.
2.	 understand one’s role and responsibilities as a productive individual 

146 and as a member of one’s family, community and society.
3.	 integrate learning across diverse domains and form linkages with other 

academic subjects.
4.	 develop sensitivity and undertake a critical analysis of issues and 

concerns of equity and diversity.

•	 understand the interrelationship of nutrition and health.
•	 identify the consequences of undernutrition and 

92 overnutrition.
•	 select appropriate and healthy food choices.

preventing food- borne diseases.

7A.1 Introduction
Every person wants to live a good quality life and have a sense of well-
being. As far back as 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
stated: “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the 
health and well-being of oneself and one’s family including food”. Yet, many 
of the environmental conditions and our own lifestyles affect our health, 
sometimes having harmful effects. At the outset let us define “health”. 
The world’s premier organisation concerned with health, the World Health 
Organisation (WHO) defines health as “a state of complete mental, physical 
and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease”. Disease 
means impairment of body health, alteration/disruption/derangement in 
function of some part or organ of the body, interrupting normal functions 
and deviating from a state of complete well-being. Health is a fundamental 
human right. All persons, irrespective of age, gender, caste, creed/religion, 
place of stay (urban, rural, tribal) and nationality, throughout their lives,

should have the opportunity to achieve It is the aim of every health 
and maintain the highest attainable professional (persons who deal with 
state of health. various aspects of health) to promote 

good health; in other words, to 

7A.2  Health and Its 	 promote maintenance of well-being 
or wellness, quality of life.

   Dimensions 
You must have noticed that the definition of health includes various 
dimensions–social, mental and physical. Let us briefly deal with all three 
dimensions before we discuss physical health in greater detail.

Social health: It refers to health of individuals and of a society.  When we are 
concerned with society, it refers to a society in which there is equal opportunity 
and access for all citizens to the goods and services essential for good health. 
When we refer to individuals, we refer to each person’s well-being – how well the 
individual gets along with other people and with social institutions. This includes 
our social skills and the ability to function as a member of the society. When we 
are faced with problems and stress, social support helps us to cope with them 
and solve the problems facing us. Social support measures contribute to positive 
adjustment in children and adults, and encourages personal growth. Emphasis 
on social health is gaining importance as scientific studies have shown that 93
persons who are socially well adjusted, tend to live longer and recover faster 
from disease. A few social determinants of health are:

– 	 Employment status
–	 Safety in workplaces
– 	 Access to health services
–	 Cultural/religious beliefs, taboos and value systems
– 	 Socio-economic and environmental conditions 
Mental health: This refers to emotional and psychological well-being. An 

individual who experiences a sense of well-being can utilise his/her cognitive 
and emotional capabilities, function well in society and meet the ordinary 
demands of daily life. The box below lists the indicators of mental health.

    A person who has positive mental health–
•	 feels that he/she is capable and competent. 
•	 can handle normal levels of stress he/she faces in daily life. 
•	 has satisfying relationships.
•	 can lead an independent life.
•	 if faced with any mental or emotional stress or events, he/she can cope with them 

and recover from them. 
•	 does not fear things.
•	 does not feel defeated or depressed for unusually long periods of time when small 

difficulties/problems are encountered.

Physical health: This aspect of health encompasses physical fitness 
and functioning of the body. A physically healthy person is able to 
undertake normal activities, does not feel unusually fatigued and has 
adequate resistance to infection and disease. 

7A.3 Health Care 
Every individual is responsible for his/her own health, but it is also a major 
public concern. Thus the government assumes considerable responsibility 
and provides health services at various levels to the citizens of the country. 
This is because good health is the foundation for good quality of life and 
standard of living for the individual and the family, and is the key for ensuring 
social, economic and human development of a community and a nation.

Health care consists of all the various services provided to individuals 
or communities by agents of health services or professions for the purpose 
of promoting, maintaining, monitoring or restoring health. Thus health 
care includes preventive, promotive and therapeutic care. Health Care 
services are delivered at three levels – primary care, secondary care and 
tertiary care levels. 

Primary Health Care: The first level of contact between individuals 
with the health care system is known as Primary Health Care.

94
Secondary Health Care: When patients from primary health care are 

referred to specialised hospital also like district hospitals, it is called as 
Secondary Health Care.

Tertiary Health Care: When patients are referred from primary and 
secondary health system for specialised  intensive care, advanced diagnostic 
support serious and medical care, then it is called as Tertiary Health Care.

7A.4 Indicators of Health
Health is multidimensional, with each dimension being influenced by 
several factors. Therefore, several indicators are employed to assess health. 
These include indicators of mortality, morbidity (illness/disease), disability 
rates, nutritional status, health care delivery, utilisation, environment, 
health policy, quality of life, etc.

7A.5 Nutrition and Health
Nutrition and health are intimately interlinked. In the global campaign 
of ‘Health for All’, promotion of nutrition is one of the primary elements. 
Nutrition is concerned with maintenance of body organs and tissues in 
structure and function. It is also concerned with growth and development 
of the body. Good nutrition enables the person to enjoy good health, resist 
infection, have adequate energy levels and perform daily tasks without 

Reprint 2025-26

Concerns and Needs in Diverse Contexts

feeling fatigued. In case of children and adolescents, nutrition is vital for 
their growth, mental development and achieving their potential. For adults, 
adequate nutrition is crucial to lead a socially and economically productive 
and healthy life. In turn, the health status of an individual determines the 
nutrient requirements of a person and food intake. During illness, nutrient 
requirements increase, and breakdown of nutrients are higher. Therefore, 
illness and disease adversely affect nutritional status. Hence, nutrition is 
a ‘fundamental pillar’ of human life, health and development. 

7A.6 Nutrients
There are more than 50 nutrients in food. Nutrients are broadly 
classified into macronutrients (required in relatively larger amounts) 
and micronutrients (required in small quantities) based on the 
amounts required by the human body. Macronutrients are generally 
fat, protein, carbohydrate and fibre. Micronutrients include the 
minerals such as iron, zinc, selenium and the various fat-soluble and 
water-soluble vitamins, each of which performs important functions. 
Some of them function as co-factors and co-enzymes in the various 
metabolic reactions that occur in the body. Nutrients can also influence 
gene expression and transcription. Different organs and systems 

95
play a critical role in the digestion, absorption, metabolism, storage 
and excretion of nutrients and their end products of metabolism. In 
essence, each and every cell in all parts of the body requires nutrients. 
Nutrient requirements in the normal healthy state vary according to 
age, sex and the physiological state, i.e., during periods of growth 
such as infancy, childhood, adolescence, and pregnancy and lactation 
in women. Level of physical activity also determines requirements for 
energy and nutrients involved in energy metabolism, e.g., vitamins 
like thiamine and riboflavin.

Knowledge about nutrients, their metabolism and sources as well as 
functions are vital. One should consume a balanced diet which includes 

foods that will provide all the necessary 
nutrients in required amounts. 

The science of nutrition is 
concerned with access to, availability 
and utilisation of food and nutrients 
for life, growth, development 
and well-being. Nutritionists 
(professionals who work in this field) 
are concerned with myriad aspects. 
These range from biological and 
metabolic aspects to what happens 

Balanced meal in disease states and how the body

is nourished (clinical nutrition). Nutrition as a discipline studies the 
nutritional needs of populations and their nutritional problems, including 
health problems caused by lack of nutrients (public health nutrition) 
and prevention of diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, 
hypertension. 

We all know that when one is ill, one may not feel like eating. What and 
how much is eaten by a person not only depends on taste but availability 
of food (food security) which in turn is influenced by purchasing power 
(economic factors), environment (water and irrigation), and  policies at  the 
national and international levels. Culture, religion, social status, beliefs 
and taboos also influence our food choices, food intake, and nutritional 
status. 

How do good health and nutrition help? Look around you. You will 
notice that people in good health are generally in a happier frame of mind 
and are more productive than others. Healthy parents are able to take 
adequate care of their children, and healthy children are generally happy 
and do well in school. Thus, when one is healthy, one is more constructive 
for oneself and can take active part in activities at the community level. It is 
therefore obvious that one cannot achieve good health and be productive, 
sociable and a contributory member of society if one is starving and 

96 undernourished.

What is malnutrition? Malnutrition is a deviation from the normal 
state of nutrition. When the intake of nutrients is less than the amount 
that is required by the body, or in excess of the requirements, malnutrition 
results. Malnutrition can take the form of overnutrition or undernutrition. 
Excess intake of nutrients results in overnutrition; inadequate intake 
results in undernutrition. Wrong food choices and combinations can be a 
very significant cause of malnutrition in adolescents. 

7A.7 Factors Affecting Nutritional 	     		
   Well-being

The World Health Organisation has listed four main factors (as shown in 
the diagram) that are important for nutritional well-being.

Nutritional Well- being 

Food and Care for the Good Health Safe
Nutrient Vulnerable for All Environment
Security

Food and nutrient security means that each and every person 
(regardless of age) has access to and can obtain adequate food and nutrients 
throughout the year, as per his/her requirements to enable him/her to 
lead a healthy life.

 Care for those who are vulnerable means that each individual needs 
loving care and attention reflected by caring behaviour. In the case of 
babies it means whether the baby receives the correct type and amount of 
food as well as care and attention. In case of expectant mothers, it refers 

98 to whether they get all the care and support they need from the family, the 
community and in case of working mothers, from employers. Similarly, 
persons who are ill and suffer from any disease require care and support 
in various ways including food, nourishment, medication, etc.

Health for all includes prevention of disease and curing disease when 
it occurs. Special attention needs to be paid to infectious diseases since 
they can deplete the body of nutrients and lead to poor health and poor 
nutritional status. Every citizen should get a minimum amount of health 
care. Health is a basic human right. Some of the diseases that take their 
toll in India, especially among young children are diarrhoea, respiratory 
infections, measles, malaria, tuberculosis among others. 

Safe environment focusses on all aspects of environment including 
physical, biological and chemical substances which may influence health. 
This includes safe, potable drinking water, hygienic food, and prevention 
of environmental pollution and degradation.

7A.8 Nutritional Problems and Their 			 
   Consequences

In India, there exist several nutritional problems in the population. 
Undernutrition is a major problem which is reflected in the high numbers 
of pregnant women who are undernourished and have small babies with 
low birth weight as well as young children (below 3 years of age) who are 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 2.indd   98 9/6/2022   12:16:31 PM



Concerns and Needs in Diverse Contexts

underweight and stunted. One-third of the babies born in India are low 
birth weight, i.e., less than 2500 gms. Similarly, considerable percentage of 
women too are underweight. There are other nutrition-related deficiencies 
such as iron deficiency anaemia, vitamin A deficiency and consequent 
blindness and iodine deficiency. Undernutrition has several negative 
effects on the individual. 

Undernutrition not only reduces body weight but has devastating 
effects on children’s cognitive development, immunity and can also result 
in disability, e.g., blindness due to vitamin A deficiency. Iodine deficiency 
is a threat to health and development, specially for young children and 
pregnant women since it results in goitre, still birth, and miscarriage in 
women, and deaf-mutism, mental retardation and cretinism in children. 

Iron deficiency also has negative impact on health and well-being. 
In infants and young children, its deficiency impairs psychomotor and 
cognitive development, and thus adversely affects scholastic performance. 
It also decreases physical activity. Iron deficiency during pregnancy affects 
the growth of the foetus and increases risk of morbidity and mortality for 
the mother. 

Conversely, overnutrition is also not good. Intake in excess of 
requirements leads to several health problems. In case of some nutrients 
if may lead to toxicity, and the person may become overweight and even 99
obese. Obesity in turn increases the risk of several diseases such as 
diabetes, heart disease and hypertension. In India, we face problems at 
both ends of the spectrum, i.e., undernutrition (nutritional deficiencies) 
and overnutrition (diet-related chronic, non-communicable diseases). 
This has been termed “double burden of malnutrition”. In our country, 
the fourth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) shows that 26.6 per 
cent men and 31.3 per cent women from urban areas are overweight or 
obese, the percentage being much lower among rural men (15.0 per cent) 
and women (14.3 per cent). 

Nutrition and infection: Providing enough food to fulfil nutritional 
requirements is not adequate. The influence of environment is also 
important. Nutritional status does not depend only on sufficient supply of 
food and nutrients but also on the person’s health status, to a great extent.  
Nutrition and infection are intimately interlinked. Poor nutritional status 
decreases resistance and immunity, and thus increases risk of infection. 
On the other hand, during infection, the body loses considerable amount of 
its nutrient reserves (through vomiting and diarrhoea), while the nutrient 
requirements are actually increased. If nutrient intake is insufficient 
compared to the requirement due to loss of appetite or inability to eat 
(if there is nausea and/or vomiting), infections will affect the nutritional 
status adversely. Thus the risk of another infection increases, and all 
persons, especially children, the elderly and those undernourished are at 
the risk of contracting more infections/diseases.

In developing countries, food-borne illnesses such as diarrhoea and 
dysentery are major problems since they can lead to dehydration and 
death. Many of the infectious and communicable diseases are due to poor 
environmental sanitation, poor household, personal and food hygiene. The 
key therefore is to look into how these diseases can be prevented. 

7A.9 Hygiene and Sanitation
Prevention and control of disease has to address both intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors which are linked with various diseases. The box below 
lists these factors.

Table 2: Intrinsic and Extrinsic factors linked with various diseases
Intrinsic/host factors Extrinsic/environmental factors
Age, sex, ethnicity, race Physical environment – air, water, soil, 

housing, climate, geography, heat, light, 
noise, radiation

Biological factors such as heredity, blood Biological environment includes the human 
groups, enzymes, levels of various being, all other living beings such as 

100 substances in blood, e.g., cholesterol animals, rodents, insects, plants, viruses, 
Functioning of various organs and systems micro organisms

Some of these act as disease-producing 
agents, some as reservoirs of infection, 
intermediate hosts and vectors of disease

Social and economic characteristics, e.g., Psychosocial factors-emotional well-being, 
occupation, marital status, housing cultural values, customs, habits, beliefs, 
Lifestyle factors, e.g., nutrition, diet, physical attitudes, religion, lifestyle, health services, 
activity, living habits, use of addictive etc.
substances such as drugs, alcohol, etc.

 
Among these factors sanitation and hygiene, nutrition and immunisation 

are key inputs. When we speak of hygiene we are concerned with essentially 
two aspects: personal and environmental. Health depends to a great extent 
on the social environment as well as on lifestyle and behaviour, including 
food intake. It is also closely related to hygiene. Poor hygiene leads to 
several infections and infestations such as worm infestations. 

Environmental hygiene comprises external matter, both organic and 
inorganic, at the domestic hygiene (home) and community levels. This 
includes physical factors such as water, air, housing, radiation, etc., 
as well as biological factors such as plants, bacteria, viruses, insects, 
rodents and animals.

Environmental health needs attention so as to create and maintain 
ecological conditions that will promote health and prevent disease. Among 
these, safe drinking water and sanitation, especially feaces disposal, are of 
great importance. Similarly air and water pollution are of concern. Water 
quality is important as contaminated water is the cause for many diseases 
such as diarrhoea, worm infestations, skin and eye infections, guinea 
worm, etc. 

Food Hygiene: Food-borne illnesses occur when we consume food that 
contains disease-causing (pathogenic) micro-organisms. Several factors 
are needed for a food-borne illness to occur.
•	 Either the organism or the toxin must be present in the food eaten.
•	 The number of pathogenic micro-organisms must be in sufficient 

numbers.
•	 The contaminated food must have been consumed in sufficient quantity.

The illnesses that are caused include diarrhoea, dysentery, amoebiasis, 
infective hepatitis, typhoid, listeriosis, botulism, cholera, gastroenteritis. 
Most of these are traced back to poor personal and food handling practices 
as outlined below.
 Use of food items that are spoiled/infected/unsafe, include water, 

spices, seasonings, mixes.
102  Improper storage leading to multiplication of disease causing micro-

organisms.
 Not practising insect and vermin control.
 Use of contaminated equipment, utensils and plates, spoons, glasses
 Inadequate cooking.
 Storage of foods at temperatures favourable to growth of microorganisms 

( 4 to 600C).
 Improper cooling.
 Improper/inadequate heating/reheating of cooked foods/left overs.
 Cross contamination.
 Leaving food uncovered.
 Use of contaminated substances for garnishing.
 Poor hygiene and sanitation of persons handling food, such as unclean 

clothes, not washing of hands, dirt and grime under the nails. 
Effective practices related to nutrition, health and hygiene are essential 

to be productive in the work that one does, within home or outside the 
home. The next chapter discusses the relationship between work, worker 
and workplace.

Learning Objectives
 
After completing this section the learner is able to—
•	 describe time and space as important resources.
•	 analyse the need for managing time and space.
•	 discuss ways of managing time and space.
•	 discuss tools in time management. 107
•	 explain the principles of planning space.

As you have learnt in the previous chapter, resources are possessions, 
material or funds which can be used to achieve goals. You have also learnt 
that money, time, space and energy are some examples of resources. These 
resources are assets for an individual. They are rarely in abundant supply 
and are also not equally available to everyone. Therefore, to achieve our 
goals appropriate management of all the resources that are available to us 
is important. If these resources are wasted or not utilised properly we may 
be hindered in reaching our goals. 

Timely and efficient management of resources enhances their 
optimism utilisation. In this chapter, you will learn about time and space 
management. Money as a resource and its management will be dealt with 
in Unit IV.

7B.1 Time Management
Time is limited and irreversible. Time is measured in years, months, days, 
hours, minutes and seconds.  We are provided with 24 hours of time each 
day to use it as we like. The key is how we use that time. If not managed 
properly, time keeps slipping away inspite of our effort to control it. No

matter how important and valuable an individual may be, one cannot stop 
time, nor slow it down, or speed it up. Once passed, time can never be 
regained.

In today’s fast changing lifestyle, our demands and responsibilities at 
home, at school and at work have increased. This has made the need for 
managing time very important. To be successful it is essential to develop 
time management skills. People who use these techniques become high 
achievers in all walks of life, from agriculture to business to sports to 
public service in all other professions and personal life. Time management 
allows one to have adequate rest and recreation along with work.  

The principle of time management is to concentrate on results, not 
on being busy. People often spend their days getting anxious about the 
unfinished task, but achieve very little, as they do not concentrate on what 
matters the most– time. For example, some students may spend their time 
worrying about examinations rather than actually studying for them.

All time management begins with planning. A time plan is necessary. 
A time plan can be defined as an advance schedule of activities to be 
performed in a given time period.  

How good is your time management? 
108

Before understanding the steps in time and activity planning, it is essential 
to determine how effective your own time management is. How often are 
you able to complete the task planned? Are you able to efficiently complete 
your weekly, daily or hourly work? For most of us, it seems that there is 
just never enough time in the day to complete all our activities.

Activity 1

The activity given below will help you identify your own time management skills.

Instructions: Score the questions given below and determine how well these statements 
describe you. The following are the ratings for your answers:
Not at all 	 = 1
Rarely	 	 = 2
Sometimes	 = 3
Often 	 	 = 4
Very often 	 = 5
Examples: If  for the first question the answer of your choice is ‘often’, then write a score 
of ‘4’ in the respective box, and if your answer is ‘rarely’ you may write your score as ‘2’ 
and so on.
After answering all the questions add your scores across all the questions to get the

46-75	 You are managing your time very effectively! However, check the section 

below to make it even better. 
31-45	 You are good at some aspects, but there is scope for improvement 

elsewhere. Focus on the key issues in the section below and you will most 
likely find that work becomes less stressful.

15-30	 The good news is that you have a great opportunity to improve your 
effectiveness at work for long term success! However, to realise this you 
have to improve your time management skills. 

Steps in time and activity plan

(a)	 Start your work as quickly as possible. Do not waste time in avoiding 
or delaying the task. When a student reaches home, she/he should 
relax for a while, have a meal and then start with the school work 
without postponing it for the end of the day.

(b)	 Get into a routine every day. Choose a time to accomplish certain 
tasks, such as completing school work, doing household chores; 

110 and then stick to the routine activities. The student should make an 
everyday routine to complete work in time, without any delay. 

(c)	 Prioritise your tasks. Before picking up any new task make sure it 
does not impact the already existing activities. Do not undertake 
too many activities at a particular time.  If the time available is less 
and work is more then keep the optional tasks for a later time and 
complete compulsory activities first. For example, if the student has 
a class test, she/he should first study for the test, then do homework 
and later get involved in other activities. 

(d)	 Do not commit yourself to unimportant and low priority tasks. Learn 
to say ‘No’. If you have less time and more tasks in hand, you should 
be able to say ‘No’ to the tasks which are not very important. For 
example, the student can avoid watching television, if she/he has to 
complete a task for the next day.

(e)	 Divide the big tasks into a series of small manageable activities. The 
day’s school work (big task) can be divided into smaller tasks by 
dividing the work as per different subjects. 

(f)	 Do not waste energy and time on tasks which do not need much 
attention.

(g)	 Deal with a task one at a time till it is completed or decide when to 
deal with it. Do not put it aside before completion. 

(h)	 Arrange ‘start’ and ‘stop’ times to schedule activities. Appropriate time 
should be allotted to each subject without spending too much time on 
each subject.

Tools in time management 

Following are the tools which help in managing time effectively—

period of time. For example, early morning time or dinner time.

(ii)	 Work Curve: A device to trace the work against time. 
116   Here, a to b is warming up period, c is plateau of maximum ability to 

       do work and d is maximum fall due to fatigue.

short. 

(iv)	 Work simplification can be 
defined as the conscious seeking of the simplest, easiest and quickest 
method of doing work. It implies proper blending and management 
of two important resources, namely time and human energy. It aims 
at accomplishing more work with a given amount of time and energy, 
or at reducing the amount of either or both to accomplish a given 
amount of work. In order to bring change in work procedure as well 
as to simplify it, three levels of changes are important. These include 
the following—
 Change in hand and body motions: It involves changes in hand 

and body motion only, keeping the same work tools and product. 
Many tasks can be completed with less effort by—

(i)	 Eliminating and combining certain process as, for example 
•	 Allowing dishes to dry on utensil racks eliminates the 

need to dry them by wiping.
•	 Making a list of all the items required from the market 

and buying them together rather than getting each item 
separately.

(ii) 	 By improving the sequence and rhythm of work, for example 
•	 Doing like tasks together – while cleaning the house, all 

the processes of dusting, sweeping and mopping should 
be done in continuation in all rooms together, rather 
than cleaning each room separately. This also helps in 
maintaining rhythm.

(iii)	 By developing skills at work – knowing and mastering a job 
well help to eliminate extra motions thereby saving both time 
and energy. 

(iv)	 By improving body posture – i.e., maintaining a correct 
and good body posture (see Figure 2 below), using muscles 
effectively, keeping the body parts in alignment and finally 
carrying the maximum weight on the bony framework, thus 
releasing the muscles of all strains.  For example, use of long 
handle on the broom instead of bending and sweeping in 117
order to maintain a stable posture (see Figure 3). 

Good Standing Posture – a good standing 
position is one in which the head, neck, 
chest and abdomen are balanced one upon 
the other, so that the weight is carried mainly 
by the bony framework and minimum effort 
and strain is placed upon the muscles and 
ligaments.  
Similarly, Good Sitting Posture for work is 
a well-balanced and poised position. The 
weight is carried by the bony support of the 
skeleton thus releasing the muscles and 
nerves of all strain. The poise is such that as 
much adjustment is done as is necessary to 
carry out the work.

 Change in work, storage space and equipment used: This requires 
organising storage spaces, rearranging kitchen equipment, 
planning work surfaces with proper height and width according 
to the user, using labour-saving devices like pressure cookers, 
washing machines, microwave oven, etc., which help in saving 
time as well as hand motions.    

 Change in the end product: These changes result from the use of – 
–	 Different raw materials – for example, using readymade 

ground spices instead of whole spices, using organic seeds 
to grow produce, etc.   

–	 Making different products from same raw materials – for 
example, making kulfi instead of ice-cream, lauki paranthas 
instead of kofta curry, etc.

–	 Changes in both the raw material and finished product – for 
example, using ball pen instead of ink pen, etc.

7B.2 Space management
Space is utilised by people to carry out various activities at home, outside 
the home and at workplace.  You must have observed that a well-designed 
room gives a sense of spaciousness, while a room with similar dimensions, 
if not managed well, results in the room looking apparently cramped or 
cluttered. Space management involves planning of space, organising it as

per the plan, implementing the plan in terms of its utilisation, and evaluating 
it in terms of achieving functionality and aesthetic appeal. A well-managed 
space not only offers comfort while working but also appears attractive. 

Space and the home

Sitting, sleeping, studying, cooking, bathing, washing, entertainment, 
etc., are the major activities to be carried out in the home. To conduct 
each of these activities and the actions that may follow them, usually 
specific areas are identified in the home. Wherever there is space available, 
specified rooms are built to carry out such activities. Most urban middle 
Socio-economic Status (SES) homes are likely to have sitting room/area, 
bed room/rooms, kitchen, store room, bathroom and toilet, verandah/
courtyard (optional).

Besides the above, some homes may additionally have other rooms like 
dining room, study room, entertainment room, dressing room, guest room, 
children’s room, garage (for scooter, car), stairs, passages, puja room, 
garden, terrace, etc. Let us learn, how to plan spaces?

  (i)	 Aspect: ‘Aspect’ indicates the arrangement of doors and windows in 
the external walls of a building which allows the occupants to enjoy   
the nature in the form of sunshine, breeze, scenery, etc. 

 (ii)	 Prospect: ‘Prospect’ in its proper sense, is the impression or impact 
that a house is likely to make on a person who looks at it from outside. 
Therefore, it includes the attainment of pleasing appearance using  
natural beauty, positioning of doors and windows, and covering up of 
undesirable views.

(iii)	 Privacy: Privacy is one of the most important principles in space 
planning. Privacy requires consideration in two ways:
 Internal privacy : Privacy of one room from another is referred to 

as internal privacy. It is attained by careful planning in the house 
with respect to grouping, positioning of doors, provision of small 
corridor or lobby, etc. Internal privacy can be also be achieved 
by setting up screens and curtains. In some homes with large 
families separate sitting area is provided for women, ensuring 
their privacy.

 External privacy : This means privacy of all parts of a house from 
the neighbouring buildings or houses, public streets and by-ways. 
It can be a shade secured by carefully planning the entrance and 

120 covering it with a tree or creepers.

External privacy – A house secured by fence and shrubs

Talk to members of your family from different age groups and ask them what they 
understand by privacy.

(iv) 	Grouping: It implies the outlook of rooms with respect to their relative 
position with each other. For example, in a building, the dining area 
must be close to the kitchen and the kitchen must be away from the 
toilet.

(v)	 Roominess: It is the spacious effect a room gives to those who live 
in it. The available space should be made use of fully. For example, 
one can have built-in wall cupboard, shelves and storage area so that 
the floor of the room is left free for various activities. In addition, 
the size and shape of the room, the furniture arrangement as well 
as the colour scheme used have a bearing on its roominess. Well 
proportionate rectangular room looks spacious compared to a square 
room of similar dimensions. Light colours make a room look more 
spacious than dark ones.

(vi)	 Furniture requirements: The rooms must be planned with due 
thought to the furniture to be placed there. Every room in a building 
should serve its purpose well. Care must be taken to place only

(vii)	Sanitation: Sanitation consists of providing ample light, ventilation, 
facilities for cleaning and sanitary conveniences in the following 
manner:
(a) 	 Light: Light has two-fold significance, firstly it illuminates, and 

secondly, it helps maintain hygiene. Light in a building may be 
provided by natural or artificial sources. Windows, bulbs, tube-
lights are some sources of light. 

(b) 	 Ventilation: It is the supply of the outside air into the building. 
Good ventilation is an important factor which affects comfort in 
the building or room. This is generally achieved by placing the 
windows, doors and ventilators such that they may allow as much 
breeze as possible. Windows, if placed opposite to each other, 
provide good ventilation. Lack of fresh air in the building may 
lead to headaches, sleepiness, inability to focus attention, etc. 
Ventilation may be natural or mechanical (using exhaust fan). 

(c) 	 Cleanliness and sanitary conveniences: General cleaning and 
up- keep of the building is the responsibility of the occupants, but 
even then some provision to facilitate cleaning and prevention of 
dust are necessary in planning. Sanitary conveniences include the 
provision of bathrooms, water closets and lavatories in a building. 
Lavatories and bathrooms in rural houses are constructed as a 123

production in the socio-cultural and economic setup of our 
lives.

7C.1 Introduction
In the earlier chapter ‘Fabrics Around Us’ you became aware of the diversity 
of the textile products and their usage. Have you ever wondered how these 
came to exist, and how in India they are considered an important heritage? 
If you ever visited a museum, you must have noticed a section where fabrics 
and apparel are displayed.  You may have realised that not only there are 
fewer exhibits in this section, they are also not as old as other objects. This 
is because fabrics decay much more quickly than bone, stone or metal. 
However, archaeological records depicting clothed human figures on wall 
and sculptures indicate that humans knew the art of making cloth even 
20,000 years ago. We also learn about them from references in ancient 
literature and paintings on walls in caves and buildings.  

Textile materials have fascinated humans since ancient times and have 
been an essential part of civilisation. People of all ancient civilisations 
developed techniques/technologies for utilising the raw material available

in their region. They also created their own distinctive designs and 
produced elaborately designed products. 

7C.2 Historical Perspective in India
The manufacture of sophisticated textiles in India is as ancient as the Indian 
civilisation. Fabric has been used as a symbol while describing the creation 
of the universe in the Rig Veda and the Upanishads. The universe, in these 
texts, is described as ‘a fabric woven by the Gods’. The appearance of Day 
and Night, as they bring light and darkness over the earth, are compared to 
the movement of the shuttle in the loom by the weaver. 

Weaving is one of the oldest arts and fine fabric products have been 
made from very early times. Cloth fragments, as well as terracotta spindles 
and bronze needles, that have been found at the excavation site at Mohenjo-
Daro, are evidence that the traditions of cotton spinning, weaving, dyeing 
and embroidery in India are at least 5000 years old. India was first among 
the ancient civilisations to discover colour and perfect the technique of 
application on textile materials, especially on cotton. Dyed and printed 
cotton fabrics were exported to other nations and they were known for 
their colourfastness properties. Classical (Greek and Latin) literature has 
reference to them, e.g., “colour on Indian fabrics is as lasting as wisdom”. 

126 Throughout the period of recorded history there are references extolling 
the excellence of Indian fabrics made from cotton, silk and wool. They 
were known for their fabric characteristics as also for designs produced on 
them through weaving, resist dyeing, printing and embroidery. They soon 
became coveted items of trade, helped in political linkages and influenced 
the establishment of such industries in other countries. From around 15th 
century onwards India was the greatest exporter of textiles ever known. The 
setting up of the various East India Companies by the European nations 
was associated with textile trade from India. 

7C.3 The Three Main Fibres
Traditionally Indian fabric production is associated with three main 
natural fibres, which are cotton, silk and wool. Let us now discuss their 
significance.

Cotton

India is the home of cotton. Cotton cultivation and its use in weaving 
are known since prehistoric times. The spinning and weaving techniques 
developed here produced fabrics, which came to be known for their 
extreme fineness and decorations. Cotton travelled from India to all over 
the world. That it was a trade item is learnt from the material recovered 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 2.indd   126 9/6/2022   12:16:33 PM



Concerns and Needs in Diverse Contexts

from archeological digs in the ancient land of Babylon with Harappan 
seals. When the Romans and Greeks first saw cotton, they described it as 
wool that grew on trees.  

The legends associated with cotton weaving are many. Dacca (now in 
Bangladesh) produced the finest fabric—the mulmul khas or the royal 
muslin. It was so fine that it was almost invisible and thus had poetic 
names; baft-hava (woven air), abe-rawan (flowing water), shabnam 
(evening dew). The Jamdani or the figured muslin traditionally woven in 
Bengal and parts of North India using cotton is one of the finest brocade 
products of Indian weaving.  

In regular weaving, the filling yarn passes over and under the warp yarn in a specific 
sequence. But when brocade designs in silk, cotton, or gold/silver yarns are to be 
woven, these yarns are transfixed in between regular weaving. Depending upon the 
fibre content used for patterning there may be cotton brocades, silk brocades, or zari 
(metallic yarn) brocades.

Besides the proficiency in making cotton fabrics, India’s crowning textile 
accomplishment was the creation of pattern in the cotton cloth with brilliant 
fast dyes. Until the 17th century, Indians alone had mastered the complicated 
chemistry of cotton dyeing, which was not mere application of pigments to 127
the surface, but produced fast and lasting colours. Indian Chintz (printed 
and painted cotton cloth) had revolutionised European fashion and market. 
Indian craftpersons were ‘the master dyers to the world’.

Cotton is woven universally all over India. Super fine yarn is still spun 
and woven in many places, though the bulk production may be thick. The 
materials are made in a variety of designs and colours and find specific 
usages in different parts of the country. 

Silk

Silk fabrics have been made in India since ancient times. We learnt in the 
earlier chapter that the origin of silk was in China. However, some silk must 
have been used in India as well. Silk weaving is mentioned as early as the 3rd 
century BC., and distinction is made between Indian and Chinese silk. The 
silk weaving centres developed in and around the capitals of kingdoms, holy 
cities or trade centres. As the weavers migrated, it helped in the development 
and creation of many new centres. Different regions in our country have 
specific silk weaving styles. Some of the important centres are–

Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, which has an old tradition in weaving 
special styles. Its best-known product is the brocade or kinkhwab. Its 
splendour and elegance and the high cost of the fabric gave it its name—
kinkhwab meaning something a person cannot even dream of or a fabric 
which is seldom seen in a dream or the golden (kin) dream (khwab).

West Bengal is traditionally famous for its silk weaving. By using a 
loom similar to that of Jamdani weavers, the weavers of West Bengal weave 
a silk brocaded sari called Baluchar Butedar. This style originated from 
a place called Baluchar in Murshidabad district. It is now successfully 
being produced in Varanasi. Here the plain-woven fabric is brocaded with 
untwisted silk thread. The most characteristic feature of these sarees is 
their pallav or the end piece. It has unique designs, depicting scenes from 
epics, royal court, domestic or travel scenes with riders and palanquins. 
Mango motif is most commonly used in borders and pallavs. 

Gujarat developed its own style of kinkhwabs. Very fine textiles were 
produced in Bharuch and Cambay, which were popular in the courts of 
Indian rulers. The Ashavali sarees of Ahmedabad are known for their 
beautiful brocade borders and pallavs. They have rich gold or silver metallic 
background on which patterns are woven with coloured threads, giving 
the fabric an enamalled appearance. Human, animal and bird motifs are 
frequently incorporated into the pattern as they are an integral part of 
Gujarati folk tradition. 

Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu is a famous brocade weaving centre in 
South India from ancient times. The traditional sarees display bird and 
animal motifs with rich brocaded pallav. Dark colours like red, purple, 

128 orange, yellow, green and blue predominate in South Indian fabrics.
Paithan, located on banks of Godavari River near Aurangabad in 

Maharashtra, is one of the oldest cities in Deccan region. It is famous 
for a special silk saree with gold inlay weaving for borders and motifs. 
The tapestry weave used in Paithan is the oldest technique of decorative 
weaving. It is known for its closely woven golden fabric. In the shimmering 
gold background, various patterns (butas, the tree of life, stylised buds and 
floral borders) are worked in red, green, pink and purple glow like jewels. 

Tapestry weave utilises the principle of discontinuous weft or filling yarns, thus 
allowing multicoloured yarns to be used. It results in the fabric appearing the 
same on its face and reverse side.

Surat, Ahmedabad, Agra, Delhi, Burhanpur, Tiruchirapalli and 
Thanjavur are other traditionally renowned centres of zari brocade weaving.

Wool

The development of wool is associated with the colder regions like hills of 
Ladhakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, hills 
of West Bengal, some N.E. states, Punjab, Rajasthan and a few places of 
Central and West India. Specialty hair, i.e., the hair of animals other than 
sheep, (mountain goats, rabbits and camels) have also been used in India.

Concerns and Needs in Diverse Contexts

The earliest references of wool make mention of very fine hair obtained 
from mountain goats and some deer like animals. 

Kashmiri literature of 11th century confirms the weaving of multicoloured 
woolen fabrics during the period. From the 14th century, the Persian 
influence led to the production of shawls. It utilised the most complex 
tapestry weave in a multitude of colours and intricate patterns. The best 
shawls were made from pashmina and shahtus, the hair of mountain 
goats. The Mughal emperors were responsible for promoting this art and 
shawls of Kashmir became world famous. Like the printed cotton these 
were a major export item from 18th century. Later embroidery was also 
introduced in shawls. The designs of the shawls copy the beauty of nature 
of Kashmir. The mango motif, also known as paisley, is seen in countless 
varieties and colour combinations. 

Akbar is said to have introduced the style of Jamawar shawls. These were 
large shawls designed in a manner, which were also suitable for making 
garments (Jama, i.e., cloak and war meaning yardage). You may have noticed 
in paintings in museums or illustrations in books, the Mughal rulers usually 
have large shoulder wraps in intricate designs. 

The shawls of Himachal Pradesh are mostly woven in angular 131
geometrical motifs grouped in straight horizontal lines, bands and stripes, 
one or two placed vertically as well. Kullu valley specifically is known for 
shawl weaving and several other woollen fabrics like pattu and dohru (wraps 
for men). 

In the recent years shawl weaving in other places have also gained 
importance. Special mention can be made of Amritsar and Ludhiana in 
Punjab, Uttrakhand and Gujarat.

7C.4 Dyeing 
We have already learnt that the history of dyeing in India is very old. Before 
the middle of 19th century the dyes were obtained only from natural 
sources. Most of the dyes used were from plants – roots, bark, leaves, 
flowers and seeds. Some insects and minerals also yielded colour. The 
analysis of the old samples confirms that Indians had a deep knowledge 
of chemistry of dyes and techniques of dye application to produce fabrics, 
renowned for their colourfastness properties.

Resist dyed fabrics

The oldest form of designing with colour is resist dyeing. Having perfected 
the art of dyeing, it must have been discovered that if certain parts of 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 2.indd   131 9/6/2022   12:16:38 PM



Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part I

material were prevented from absorbing the dye, it would retain its original 
colour and thus appear designed. The resist material could be thread, 
pieces of fabric, or substances such as clay and wax that offer physical 
resistance. The most common method of resist is tying with thread. There 
are two methods of tie and dye fabrics produced in India; fabric tie and 
dye and yarn tie and dye. In both cases the part where design is required, 
is tied up by tightly winding a thread around it and dyeing. During the 
dyeing process, the tied areas retain the original colour of the ground. On 
drying, some tied up parts are opened and some more tied and dyed again. 
The process can be further repeated for more colours, always proceeding 
from light to dark colours.

Tie and dye has a ritualistic significance. Among the Hindus, the thread 
tied around the wrist before any religious ceremony is white, yellow and 
red tie-dyed. Tie and dyed fabrics are considered auspicious for marriage 
ceremonies; the dress of the bride and turbans of male members are 
generally of these fabrics.   
(i)	 Fabric tie and dye: Bandhani, chunari, laheria are some of the names 

of materials in which the pattern is created by tie-dyeing the fabric 
after it is woven. A typical tie and dye design is bandhej where the  
patterns comprise innumerable dots; another is the laheria type where 

132 the pattern is in the form of diagonal stripes. Gujarat and Rajasthan 
are the homes of this type of fabrics.

(ii)	 Yarn tie and dye: This is a complicated process of producing designed 
fabrics. These are known as Ikat fabrics. Fabrics are produced by a 
technique in which the warp yarns or filling/weft yarns or both are 
tie-dyed before weaving. Thus, when the fabric is woven, a specific 
pattern appears depending on the dyed spaces of the yarns. If only 
one yarn, i.e., only warp or weft yarn is tie-dyed, it is called single Ikat; 
if both yarns are so treated, it can be combined Ikat (both are creating 
separate patterns) or double Ikat (a unified pattern is created).

The Ikat artisan is not only proficient in the art of dyeing; she/he also has 
the technical knowledge of weaving. The process consists of calculating the 
amount of warp and filling yarns required for the article to be made. The tying 
of the yarn and weaving it after dyeing require great expertise so that warp and 
filling yarns match to produce the design. 

Gujarat has the richest tradition of Ikat weaving. Patola is the most 
colourful double Ikat sari made in silk. Its manufacture is concentrated 
in Patan, in Mehsana district. Apart from geometrical design patterns 
inspired from local architecture, other designs are flowers, birds, animals 
and dancing dolls. The colours most commonly used are red, yellow, green, 
black and white. They tend to flow into one another without the harshness 
of outline.

Orissa is another region where Ikat saris and fabrics of cotton and silk 
are produced. The process here is known as Bandha, which may be single 
or combined ikat. Compared to Patola, the designs here have a softer and 
curvilinear quality. They are also characterised by the addition of extra 
weft yarn woven in small figurative designs.  

Pochampalli and Chirala in Andhra Pradesh have the tradition of 
production of cotton ikat fabrics called Telia Rumals.  These were designed 
75–90 cms. square pieces of  fabric usually woven as a pair. The coarser 
ones were used as lungis, shoulder cloth or loincloth by the fishermen 
community and the finer ones as dupattas or veils. 

7C.5 Embroidery
Embroidery is the art of surface ornamentation of fabric with threads of 
silk, cotton, gold or silver using needle or needle like tools. Embroidery, 
an ancient art form, referred to as painting with a needle, was practised in 
many parts of the world. In India too it has been practised from very early 
times and there is evidence to indicate that embroidery was prevalent all 
over the country–
•	 at all socio-economic levels – from the nomadic cattlemen to members 

135
of royal households.

•	 on all kinds of fabrics – from the most coarse cotton and camel wool 
to finest of silks and pashminas. 

•	 with all materials and threads – cotton, wool, silk or zari along with 
cowrie shells, bits of mirror and glass, beads, gems and coins. 

•	 used in making varied articles –  personal clothing, household use, 
home decoration, offerings for religious places and decorative items 
for their animals and cattle.
Embroidery is generally regarded as a homely handicraft, an occupation 

that women undertake during their leisure hours, mainly to ornament 
or decorate articles of apparel or household use. Nevertheless, certain 
embroideries became items of trade within country and also in different 
parts of the world. Let us now have a glimpse into some of the styles, 
which are being commercially produced today.

Phulkari 

Phulkari is the art of embroidery of Punjab. It is the term used for both the 
embroidery and the chaddar or shawl made with this type of embroidery. 
Phulkari means ‘flower work’ or a bed of flowers. The other term bagh 
(literally a garden) has also the same connotation. Phulkari was mainly 
a domestic craft, executed by the girls and ladies of the household and 
sometimes by women servants under their directions. The embroidery is 

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 2.indd   135 9/6/2022   12:16:43 PM



Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part I

done on coarse cotton (khaddar) material with untwisted silk floss called 
pat. In the heavily embroidered baghs, the embroidery covers the fabric 
so completely that the base colour of the fabric can only be seen on the 
reverse side. Traditionally, this embroidery was associated with wedding 
ceremonies and baghs were made by the maternal grandmother for her 
grand-daughter or by the paternal grandmother for her grand daughter-
in-law.

Kasuti

Kasuti is the term used for the embroidery of Karnataka. Kasuti word is 
derived from the Persian word kashida, which means embroidery. Like 
phulkari, it is also a domestic craft mainly done by women. This is the 
most subtle form of embroidery, where the embroidery threads follow 
the pattern of the weave of the fabric. It is done on silk material with 
fine strands of silk threads. Even the colours used tend to blend with 
the background material. The main designs seem to be inspired from the 
temple architecture of the area. 

Kantha 
136

Kantha embroidery of Bengal is done on a base prepared by 3-4 layers of 
old cotton sarees or dhotis. The embroidery is like quilting – small running 
stitches going through all the layers of the base material. The article thus 
produced are also known as Kantha. This embroidery may have had its 
origin in darning to strengthen the worn-out areas, but now the stitches 
fill up the shapes that are drawn on it. It generally has a white base with 
embroidery in multi-coloured threads, which were originally pulled out 
from borders of old sarees. The articles made vary from small comb case 
and wallet to shawls of various sizes. There are also kanthas with ritualistic 
importance made for presentation to religious places or for use on special 
occasions.

Kashida

Kashida is the general term used for embroidery in Kashmir. The two most 
important embroideries are suzani and zalakdozi. Kashmir being the land 
of wool, the embroidery is done on woollen fabrics – from the finest of 
shawls to medium thickness cloaks like ‘pherans’, to thick namdas used 
as floor coverings. 

On shawls and fine woollens, perhaps the embroidery had its origin 
in repairing the defects that occurred during weaving. Later the multi-
coloured weaving patterns were copied, to which were added the styles 
of Chinese embroideries like satin stitch and long and short stitch. The

suzni embroidery includes all the stitches that lie flat on the surface and 
also show uniformity on both sides of the material. This embroidery is 
done with silk threads, in a multitude of colours, and shades to make the 
designs look natural.

The twill tapestry technique that was used for weaving often required small 
corrections and alterations. This was done like embroidery repeating the 
pattern of the weave, thus was called darning. The embroiderers in Kashmir 
are still referred to as rafugars, i.e., darners.

Zalakdozi is the chain stitch embroidery done with ‘ari’ – a hook like the 
cobblers use. Originally it was done mainly on namdas, but now it is done 
on all kinds of materials, including shawls. Unlike the other embroideries 
discussed so far, Kashmir embroidery is a commercial activity, done by 
men folk and thus caters to the demand of the buyers.

Chikankari 

Chikankari of Uttar Pradesh is the embroidery, which was commercialised 
at a very early stage. Although ladies do the main work, the master craft 
persons and organisers of the trade are mainly men. Lucknow is considered 139

the main centre for the work. Originally it was done on white material with 
white thread. The main effects produced are shadow work by embroidering 
on the wrong side of the material, net like surface by tightening the yarns 
of the fabric with embroidering, and raised patterns on the face of the 
fabric by knotting stitch resembling rice or millet grains. The past few 
years have also seen the inclusion of zari threads, small beads and shiny 
discs (sitara) incorporated in the designs. Since it is a commercial activity, 
the designs and styles keep changing with fashion.

Gujarat has a very rich tradition in embroidery

It has basically been a land of nomadic tribes who have thus been 
responsible for amalgamation of designs and techniques of various cultures. 
Here embroidery is used for all aspects of life; decoration of the doorways 
with torans or pachipattis and walls with chaklas or chandrawas, ganesh 
sthapnas (all these are important in a nomadic lifestyle), garments for 
men, women and children in styles specific to various tribes, coverings 
for cattle, horses, elephants. Many of the embroideries are known by the 
names of the tribes – Mahajan, Rabari, Mochibharat, Kanbibharat, and 
Sindhi. Most of the colours used are bright and loud.

Appliqué work in Gujarat has its own style. It is a patchwork, in 
which the pieces of fabric with different designs are cut in different sizes 
and shapes and sewn on a plain background. This is used mainly on 
household items.

Bead work of Saurashtra and Kutch is also an important art. It is 
not an embroidery, but interlacing of different coloured beads through a 
network of threads to create coverlets for utensils, hangings, purses, etc.

The close proximity of the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan, and because 
Rajasthan also has a tribal population has resulted in embroidery in a 
similar style. The colours and the motifs used vary between the tribes and 
the occasions for which they are produced.

Chamba rumals 

Chamba rumals, from the erstwhile hill state of Chamba in Himachal 
Pradesh were made mainly for covering trays of gifts, when being presented 
to dignitaries or special guests. They depicted mythological scenes similar 
to Pahadi Paintings, by using running stitch in outline and darn-stitch in 
filling. At their best, the scenes appeared the same on either side of the 
textile.

7C.6 Conclusion
India has beautiful textiles which have been recognised the world over 

140 for their beauty and craftsmanship. Repeated and persistent invasions, 
migrations, political upheavals and many other ups and downs led to 
a synthesis that enriched the textile craft of India. The richness and 
diversity of contemporary form of art practised in India owes much to the 
coexistence of numerous cultural strains on its soil.

Specific geographical regions in India have age-long traditions 
associated with fabric production. This is in terms of different fibre groups 
– cotton, silk and wool and different manufacturing processes – spinning, 
weaving, dyeing and printing and surface ornamentation. With changing 
times, the production centres have evolved their own grammar in terms of 
colour, design and ornamentation and their usage for specific products. A 
large number of such centres continue to be important in the social and 
economic life not only for the production of items associated with religious 
and social rites, also in their effort to make a statement which fits into 
contemporary usage. Thus they are making an effort to go in for product 
diversification and alternate usage of traditional textiles. Gradually the 
emphasis is also shifting from customised products to mass production. 

Almost all the traditions of Indian textiles have survived. New design 
development has only enriched these age-old traditions. Numerous 
government and non-government organisations, along with many academic 
institutions, have joined hands to preserve, revive and contemporarise the 
textile traditions.

wonder why did the book address the adolescent 
years first and childhood later. Well, it is because 
if you as an adolescent understand issues 151

about yourself first, it would be easier to grasp 
the issues that are concerned with the stage of 
childhood, and later with adulthood. In this unit 
you will be studying about, critical concerns of 
children about their health, nutrition, education 
and clothing. As we would like children with 
disabilities to be an inclusive part of our society, 
the chapters provide us important information on 
their needs and ways to meet them.

Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter the learner is able to–
•	 describe the nutritional needs of children at different stages of 

development.
•	 make suggestions for planning balanced meals for children
•	 discuss food habits of children.

152 •	 identify important health and nutrition related problems of children.
•	 describe the immunisation schedule.

8.1	 Introduction 
Do you remember learning about food and nutrition in Chapter 5? You 
also learnt about aspects of survival, growth and development of children 
in the previous chapter? Let us go over some important points again, 
briefly. Our diet is made up of the foods we eat. Nutrition is “food at work”, 
a process by which we obtain nutrients and metabolise them for growth, 
repair and well-being. When we talk of nutrition we need to understand 
the composition of foods and to know which food provides what nutrients.

Let us now focus on nutrition, health and well-being of children.
Children grow continuously and so their nutritional needs depend on 

their rate of growth, body weight, and on how effectively the nutrients are 
utilised at each stage of their development. Since physical and mental 
development takes place very rapidly in children, nutritional deficiency 
at this stage can result in lifelong impairments and disabilities. On the 
other hand, adequate nutrition ensures that the children grow to their 
full potential. We, therefore, need to understand the art of balancing their

food intake while enjoying variety of foods from all the food groups. It is 
generally believed that good nutrition is reflected in height and weight 
gained by children, but effectively it improves and maintains their well 
being in totality. Adequate nutrition contributes towards–
•	 functions of the organs and systems of the body.
•	 cognitive performance.
•	 body’s ability to fight diseases and restore healing.
•	 increase in energy levels.
•	 develop pleasant and positive attitude.

energy, children should get:

Protein  	 - 	 For muscular growth.

Calcium   	- 	 For healthy bones.

Iron        	 - 	 For growth and expansion of blood volume.

Dietary requirements of infants  

Infants are able to regulate their needs by consuming more milk or less 
milk. Their nutritional requirements are met through the composition of 
breast milk and contributions from complementary foods given to them.

The recommended nutrients are computed on the basis of composition 
of mother’s milk. An average secretion of 850 ml of breast milk of a well-
nourished mother should provide all the nutrients for the first 4–6 months. 
The baby thrives well if the mother is well nourished. She must, therefore, 
eat a diet rich in protein, calcium and iron and consume adequate 
quantities of fluids like milk, soups, fruit juices, and even water to avoid 
malnutrition.

Breast feeding

Mother’s milk is nature’s gift to the newborn 
baby. It is enriched with all the required 
nutrients which are easily absorbed. WHO 
recommends exclusive breast feeding for six 
months. During breast feeding even water 
is not required. Babies should be put on 
breast milk soon after birth. During the first 
2–3 days a yellow coloured fluid known as 
colostrum is produced. Babies must be 
fed on it as it is very rich in antibodies and 
protects a child from infections.

Benefits of breast feeding
•	 It is nutritionally tailor-made for meeting the infant’s nutritional needs.
•	 It is enriched with all the nutrients in required proportion and form 

(e.g,. the fat present is emulsified). Its low amount of protein reduces 
pressure on the kidneys and Vitamin C is also not destroyed.

•	 It is a simple, hygienic and convenient method of feeding both for the 
mother and the child. Milk is available at all times and at the right 
temperature.

•	 It protects babies from gastro-intestinal, chest, and urinary infections 
due to the presence of antibodies in it giving it natural immunity, and 
it is free from allergens.

•	 It gives protection to mothers against breast and ovarian cancers, and 
also from developing weak bones.

•	 It is very conducive for a healthy, happy emotional relationship between 
the mother and the child.
Babies know when and how much they want and so the “best clock 

is baby’s hunger”, though efforts must be made towards regularising the 
feeding intervals, after a baby reaches one month of age.

Feeding the low birth weight infant

You may know that some children are born low in body weight. A baby 
weighing less than 2.5 kgs at birth is considered as low birth weight.
The problems facing such babies are that they have poor sucking and 
swallowing reflexes. Their absorption capacity is also very low because of 
the small size of their stomachs and intestines, but they have a relatively 
high calorie requirement. Breast milk produced by their mothers has all 
the essential amino acids, calories, fat and sodium content. It meets all 
their requirements. Anti-microbial property of their mother’s milk protects 155
them from infections.

So, undoubtedly, mother’s milk is the best food for low birth weight 
babies. Simultaneously, they require vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, and 
iron to promote steady growth. Dietary supplements should be considered 
only if the baby does not gain weight satisfactorily.

Complementary foods

Complementary feeding is the process 
of gradually introducing other 
foods along with breast milk. Foods 
that are introduced are thus called 
complementary foods. These can be 
introduced by 6 months of age. It 
is important that in the process of 
complementary feeding good hygienic 
conditions must be maintained when 
using feeding bottles and utensils to 
avoid infection to the baby.

In order to ensure the fulfilment 
of nutritional needs of infants,

Guidelines for complementary feeding

•	 Only one food should be introduced at a time.
•	 Small quantities should be fed in the beginning which can be gradually 

increased.
•	 Do not force if the child dislikes any food. Try something else and 

re-introduce later.
•	 Spicy and fried foods should be avoided for small babies.
•	 All types of food should be encouraged without showing personal 

dislikes.
•	 Variety in foods is very important to make new foods acceptable.

Activity 1

Ask your parent/grandparent/aunt about the traditional complementary foods of your 
region. Do you think these foods are nutritious? Give reasons for your answers.

Immunisation

Good health and well-being are not entirely dependent on good nutrition. 157
We all are aware of the role of immunisation in protecting children from 
various diseases.

You may be interested in knowing how immunisation protects 
children from diseases. A vaccine that contains an inactive form of a 
bacterium/virus/toxin made by the germ is injected in the child.  Being 
inactive it does not cause infections but induces white blood cells to 
produce antibodies. These antibodies then kill the germs when they attack 
the child’s system.

Human Ecology and Family Sciences

Common health and nutrition problems in infants and 
young children 

We have learnt in Chapter X in Part I how malnutrition and infections are 
interrelated. In fact malnutrition is a national problem. It is a consequence 
of several factors such as illiteracy, poverty, ignorance about nutritional 
needs of children, and poor access to health care, especially in rural and 
tribal areas.

Children begin to be malnourished when breast milk is no longer 
available in adequate amounts and they continue to remain so till they can 
make full use of the family diet. During this period incidence of diarrhoea 
is very common in infants. It results in depletion of water and electrolytes 
from the body and this condition is a major cause of infant mortality. 
Research evidence favours the view that nutritional factors play a role 
in causation of tuberculosis particularly in populations subjected to food 
shortage. Primary herpes simplex is another infectious disease which 
affects children if they are suffering from malnutrition at the same time.

 Nutritional deficiency diseases may set in at this stage if the infant is 
not exclusively breast fed and when complementary foods do not meet the 
nutrient needs of infants. Let us list the important deficiency diseases that 

158 may occur in childhood precisely                                                                    
•	 Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM): leads to growth retardation and 

infections leading to diarrhoea and dehydration
•	 Anemia : caused due to iron deficiency
•	 Nutritional blindness : results due to vitamin A deficiency
•	 Rickets and osteopenia are bone-related : due to shortage of vitamin D 

and calcium
•	 Goitre (enlargement of the thyroid gland) : due to deficiency of Iodine

Much of the major effects of nutrition on communicable diseases 
have already been focussed in the previous chapter. The six dreaded 
communicable diseases namely polio, diphtheria, tuberculosis, pertusis, 
measles and tetanus compound the incidence of mortality and morbidity, 
more so in developing countries like India. The low age of attack is one 
more factor responsible for high fatality. The problem worsens when 
infection and malnutrition co-exist in the same infant. Immunisation 
given at different stages of the first year of life gives life-long immunity to 
children against communicable diseases. 

In rural and tribal areas, factors such as poor access to health centres, 
climatic conditions, certain local customs, and use of untested traditional 
methods of treatment increase the child’s susceptibility to infectious 
diseases. There is need to inform people about the health hazards of 
contaminated food, poor environmental sanitation and inadequate personal 
hygiene and their role in causing communicable diseases.

8.3 Nutrition, health and well-being of 
preschool children (1-6 YEARS)	  

Preschoolers, as you all know are very energetic, active and spirited. The rapid 
growth of infancy is comparatively slowed down now. But the child is very 
active. There continues to be physical, mental and psychological development. 

Preschoolers are still developing their eating habits and working on 
chewing and swallowing skills. It is, therefore, an excellent time to help 
the child become familiar with eating healthy meals and snacks. Healthy 
eating habits formed during these years are likely to be reflected in their 
food behaviour later on.

159
Nutritional needs of preschool children 

Basic nutritional needs of preschoolers are similar to the nutritional needs 
of other members of the family. The amounts needed differ because of age, 
height, current weight and health status, and also their activity level. There 
is also an increased demand for energy to support growth and development.

Human Ecology and Family Sciences

It is important to note here that because of basal losses and additional 
requirements, needs may vary a little from child to child.

Guidelines for healthy eating for preschoolers

We know that like many other habits the child should also develop good 
food habits early in life. In order to teach them that “healthy eating is part 
of healthy life style” one can follow the suggestions given below–  
•	 Mealtime can be a family time. Eating together as a family in a pleasant 

and enjoyable atmosphere helps children. Children learn by imitating 
the eating behaviour of other members of the family.

•	 Variety is one of the important aspects and hence offering a choice of foods 
in child size portions is important. The child should be taught to finish 
everything on the plate. At the same time give them enough time to finish.

•	 There should be regularity in mealtime and snack time so the child 
gets properly hungry.

•	 Put new items on the menu along with the child’s preferred foods. A 
balance between hard, soft and colourful foods should be maintained 
to stimulate interest.

•	 Menus must include dishes which are easy to handle and eat, like in 
160 the form of finger foods such as small sandwiches, chapatti rolls, small 

size samosas/idlis, whole fruit or hard boiled eggs.
•	 Serve meals at one place and not when the child is walking around. 

You may want to select suitable seating arrangements for the physical 
comfort of the child. 

•	 Above all, have the child rest before meals. A tired child may not be 
interested in eating.

•	 It is suggested that never ever bribe or punish the child to eat and 
finish certain foods. It is injurious to building healthy food habits.   

Planning balanced meals for preschool children

An active preschool child’s energy needs rival those of some grown up women. 
So we need not track their calorie consumption. But given the velocity of 
growth and activity, if the child is denied of nutritious balanced meals, 
she/he may not achieve her/his full genetic potential for adult height. It 
may affect the health also. Children suffer from Protein-Energy Malnutrition 
(PEM), xerophthalmia (vitamin A deficiency) and anaemia if protein, vitamin 
A and iron respectively are lacking in their meals. Universal use of iodised 
salt is a simple and cheap method of preventing Iodine Deficiency Disorders. 

The diet of a preschool child should emphasise three aspects–               
–	 Variety in textures, tastes, smells and colours, to broaden a child’s 

nutritional intake and eating experience,

Nutrition, Health and Well-being

–	 Balance of complex carbohydrates, lean proteins and essential fats,          
–	 Moderation while indulging in sweets, ice creams, fast foods rich in 

fats and refined flours.
   Now do you remember the five food groups you learnt in Chapter III in 
part I? The five food groups suggested by ICMR permit us to plan balanced 
meals according to our recommended dietary allowances. While planning 
daily diets foods must be chosen from all the food groups. In order to 
make planning more convenient, ICMR has suggested diets for different 
age groups. We could refer to Table 5 below for the quantities of various 
food groups to be included in a balanced diet for preschool children.  

Table 5: Balanced Diet for Preschool Children

Other vegetables 50 100

5. Sugar 15 25

Now we should be able to plan three meals 
and two snacks for a preschool child. You may be 
wondering why snacks. Because it is hard for the 
preschoolers to eat enough in three meals, healthy 
snacks in between meals provide the calories and 
nutrients they need. Besides snack time is a good 
time to introduce new foods. Snacks also go well in 
school tiffin.

Let us look at a situation and analyse how we 
can plan snacks and meals for a preschooler.

The parents of a six years old child can plan and 
prepare the following meals for a day–

Breakfast: Wheat porridge cooked in milk/bread 
or roti, egg and seasonal fruit.

School tiffin: Sandwich with vegetable filling and a healthy drink.
Lunch: Vegetable/paratha/roti, rice, curd, boiled channa and salad.

Reprint 2025-26

unit_3_as_26_7_09_cyan-Final.indd   161 2/9/2023   12:09:43



Human Ecology and Family Sciences

Evening snack: Milk, biscuit/peanuts and fruit.
Dinner: Chapati/rice, dal/chicken, cooked seasonal vegetable and salad.
Now how do you rate the parent's attempt to plan and serve balanced 

meals to the child?
Snacks served to the children in the different regions include items 

such as murukku, laddoos, upma, mathi, chana-chur which are traditional 
preparations and are nutritious. The high activity levels of children 
increases the energy needs and hence such snacks may be useful in 
providing enough calories to meet their needs.

Some examples of low cost snacks

—	 Equal amounts of soya bean dal and sunflower seeds are ground, 
mixed and fermented together. 

—	 Sweet chikki (like traditional peanut chikki) has great acceptability in 
rural and semi-urban areas of India.

—	 Indigenous foods such as flours of rice, cow pea, horse grain and 
amaranths,  jaggery are mixed in equal amounts with ground nut oil to 
prepare various snacks.

162 —	 Sundal, Payasam, Dhokla and Upma are popular snacks.
—	 Vegetable soup prepared from seasonal and locally available vegetables. 

Even leftover vegetables, dals and cereals can be added.  
—	 Spiced baked potatoes.
—	 Chiwrha (poha) prepared from rice, wheat or maize flours or other 

products and stuffed with seasonal vegetables can be served 
with sauce.

Activity 2

You are asked to take care of a four-year-old child for a day from 10 am to 6 pm. Keeping 
a balanced diet in mind suggest what you will serve to her/him for  meals and snacks.

Feeding children with special needs

Feeding children with special needs often poses challenges at mealtimes. 
While helping them with feeding and other nutritional issues, three main 
aspects have to be taken into account–

Reprint 2025-26

unit_3_as_26_7_09_cyan-Final.indd   162 2/9/2023   12:09:43



Nutrition, Health and Well-being

Observations: Closely observe the child’s behaviour and progress at 
mealtimes. Observe their abilities to handle food, food preferences, allergies 
and any specific condition. Promote and help them develop the skill they 
need to get adequate nutrition and experience pleasant mealtimes. 

Developing eating skills: Children with disability are likely to require 
more time to eat. They often struggle to feed themselves and make bigger 
messes. Focus on positive reinforcement to keep them motivated and 
prevent resistance.

Make sure the child is seated comfortably and avoid feeding her/him if 
she/he can do it himself. Help them develop self-feeding skills.

Allow the child to eat increasingly challenging textures as she/he 
progresses.  Adaptive equipment may be used if needed.

Respect the child’s food preferences, eating space and whether or not 
she/he chooses to eat. Try and set regular feeding timings.

Special diets: Some of the children may require modifications in their 
diets and mealtime routine depending on their ability. Spastic children 
may struggle with different food textures. Thin liquids may be thickened 
and dry or lumpy foods can be chopped or softened to make it easier for 
the child to swallow. A feeding tube may be used if required.

Some children with disability have a tendency to be overweight making 
eating difficult. Children with autism have an altered sense of taste or smell 163
affecting their acceptance of food. Depending on their choices extra fat, 
limited liquids, special formula or other dietary changes may be needed.

All foods to which a child with special needs is allergic should 
immediately be removed from her/his diet as it may cause damage.

Immunisation

Some more vaccinations in combating communicable diseases are due 
now. Refer to Table 6 below and note that the preschool child is now due 
for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) and Typhoid Vaccines besides 
booster doses of DPT and OPV.

School age children too are extremely active physically. With the incidence 
of communicable diseases out of the way, the child is now quite strong. 
You may notice that the growth pattern is rather slow now. Instead body 
changes occur gradually, especially from 9 to 10 years onwards, when 
boys and girls show different growth patterns.

Planning diets for school-age children

Following all aspects and guidelines of diet planning for preschool children, 
it may appear that by school age the children establish a particular pattern 
of food intake. To an extent you are right but planning balanced meals for 
school children may differ in other aspects. Let us discuss these briefly.

	 Aim for variety:  We know 
that no single food can provide all 
the nutrients in the amount the child 
needs every day. The most consistent 
nutrition message therefore is to eat a 
variety of foods. Variety also increases 
the likelihood of accepting new foods.

	 Ensure good nutrition: We 
know that children at this age need 
more protein, calcium, iron and iodine. 
They must be encouraged to eat 
vegetables, fruits, whole grains. Fruits 
and vegetables improve the macronutrient density in their diets and whole 
grains reduce the risk of diseases like cardiovascular and diabetes. Iodised 
salt, as mentioned earlier, is the easiest way to avoid iodine deficiency. 165

	 Limit intake of saturated fat, salt and sugar: You know that the 
growth of school children has now slowed down. Maintain fat calories to 
20 per cent of total calories. Diets rich in fats and sugars increase the risk 
of obesity and its related problems. Foods with added sugars are also a 
cause of dental caries. A high sodium intake may increase blood pressure 
leading to major risk factors of stroke, kidney and coronary diseases. Do 
you know that young children are frequently falling prey to diabetes and 
high blood pressure now-a-days?

	 Ensure eating breakfast: Breakfast is a special meal. It should 
contain more of protein and energy. After the long night’s fasting the 
child should never be allowed to skip breakfast. Skipping breakfast will 
negatively affect her/his physical and mental performance, and the loss of 
calories and nutrients cannot be made up later in the day.

	 Involve children in meal planning: As children grow older they can 
be involved in planning their meals. It will make healthy eating interesting 
for them. Amrita has an 8-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter. She 
talks to them about making choices and planning balanced meals. She 
even takes them along to buy ingredients, at the same time she teaches 
them what to check while buying raw food material. Don’t you think she 
makes the task of serving them nutritious meals attractive? Besides, 
encourage children in age- appropriate tasks of cooking their meals, and 
serving. They often get excited and develop healthy and positive concepts 
of food.

Besides following the guidelines for planning balanced diets you may 
refer to Table 8 for the quantities of foods to be consumed by school going 
children as recommended by ICMR:

Amrita and Ankit very particular about serving three balanced meals and 
two healthy snacks to their school age children. Let us view the diet plan 

166 prepared by them for their children for today. You can use it as cross 
reference.
—	 Breakfast: Milk and cornflakes, Rawa upma and an apple or any 

seasonal fruit 
—	 School Tiffin: Grilled sandwich with egg filling for their daughter but 

paneer filling for the son (who is allergic to egg) and a seasonal fruit.
—	 Lunch: Vegetable pulao, tomato rings and cucumber sticks for salad 

and butter milk.
—	 Evening Snack: Boiled potato and moong sprout chaat.
—	 Dinner: Bengal gram dal or chicken curry, okra and onion vegetable, 

chapati and raw salad.
In rural areas the breakfast may consist of items such as upma (with 

banana), pootu (with chana curry or banana), idli or dosa (with sambar/ 
coconut chutney) or appams (with potato/chicken curry) in the south or 
paranthas with buttermilk or poori with potato preparation in the north. 
Snacks may include items prepared from rice flour with a filling of jackfruit 
and a paste of nuts or rice flour extruded from a mould in thin strands 
– both items being steamed. Murukku is another item that can be served 
as a snack for older children. In tribal areas emphasis is placed on foods 
gathered from the forest such as nuts, berries and other fruits/flowers 
obtained from trees. Lunch and dinner can consist of chapattis and rice, a 
pulse/dal preparation and a vegetable preparation.

Activity 3

Suppose you have a 9-year-old sister and an 11-year-old brother, and both are 
vegetarian. Suggest what you will serve them for breakfast and dinner.

Factors that influence diet intake of preschool-age and 
school-age children 

Despite all the planning and preparation of the child’s meals, chances 
are that the younger child is missing out on some vital nutrients. Do 
you know why? Because children are in the process of developing their 
eating habits and many factors are influencing these habits. These are 
discussed below.

Family environment: Put simply, families that use positive parenting 
practices encourage total well-being of children. We generally observe that 
with or without conscious effort the family guides and shapes the food 
preferences and establishes the food patterns of their school children. 
Parents should therefore acquire proper nutritional knowledge and 
incorporate it into planning diets for their children.  Eating together in a 
comfortable and happy atmosphere is conducive to good eating habits and 167
nutrient intake.

Media: TV commercials and their favourite film stars endorsing the 
products have very strong influence. More exposure, more independence 
and above all more understanding of the catchy slogans tempts children 
of this age. Attracted by the messages conveyed by commercials they 
insist on foods which are low in fibre, and high in sugar, fat and sodium. 
Similarly, an attractive display of foods with harmful additives during 
festivities influences their between meals snacking which in turn lessens 
their appetite for proper meals. A conducive family environment would 
help to combat this issue.

Peers:  As the child enters school, there is a change of dependence 
from parental standards to those set by the peer group. So food intake 
may differ from what is followed at home due to peer influence. Adequacy 
in terms of nutrients does not depend on what food is available to children 
of this age but on what their friends eat. Children usually eat well in the 
company of friends.  The tiffin given for school is often finished. When they 
eat along with their peers, they are willing to eat new foods which they 
otherwise refuse. In order to promote a positive attitude towards good food 
habits in preschoolers it is best to have group settings.

Socio-cultural Influences: Every region has its typical foods and 
flavours. The family usually serves the same food to young children that 

Reprint 2025-26

unit_3_as_26_7_09_cyan-Final.indd   167 2/9/2023   12:09:43



Human Ecology and Family Sciences

adults eat. Eating with the family encourages children to like foods typical 
of their own region, and also of other regions. As an example, children in 
the north of India enjoy eating southern dishes such as idlis and dosas 
with relish, while children in southern states like parathas and rajma-rice 
of the north.

Erratic Appetite:  You may notice that the child may eat one meal well 
while refusing the next altogether. This should not be worrying because 
these are temporary moods and disappear if not reinforced by bribes, 
punishments or rigid rules.

Healthy habits

Now you can understand that good health is a blend of physical and 
emotional well-being. Besides adequacy of food in terms of nutrients, 
school children need to develop some healthy habits– 

•	 Establish sensible eating habits: Children at this age sometimes 
turn into munching machines glued to the TV and having no physical 
activity. Radha has an innovative solution for a situation like this. She 
prepares a bowl of fruit and vegetable salad with lots of lettuce leaves, 
some nuts/sprouts/boiled chick peas/steamed beans or carrots/

168
tofu or paneer chunks, adds some interesting dressing and serves 
this in plenty. She keeps changing the combinations giving them 
fancy names.

•	 Encourage physical activity: Healthy eating and physical activity 
go hand in hand with moderate activity of 45–60 minutes promotes 
good health. Limit television watching and encourage sports. Children 
should be encouraged to take part in extracurricular activities of school 
and community. Parents have to be a model on active lifestyle and 
healthy eating patterns. 

•	 Ensure food safety: Children should be trained to eat under hygienic 
conditions. Food consumed should be clean and safe before eating. 
They must wash their hands, fruits, and vegetables before eating. My 
neighbours Kanta involves her children in washing, cutting, mixing and 
cooking (under her supervision). It has become their habit to prepare 
and eat food under hygienic conditions.

•	 Ensure control over quantity intake: Children of 9–12 years can 
gauge how hungry they are. We must never force them for more if they 
do not want to eat. Doing so will override their feeling of fullness. Food 
should not be used as a way of showing love. Besides, skipping a meal 
is no problem as long as the child is healthy. But this should not be 
made a habit.

Nutrition, Health and Well-being

Health and nutrition issues of school age children

With the concerted efforts of parents in following immunisation schedules 
and healthy nutrition pattern the child by this time is strong enough to 
fight occasional colds and cough. 

You may know that obesity is a growing health risk among children 
now. This is largely due to a diet rich in fatty foods high in salt, low in fiber 
and beverages with added sugar. Non-active lifestyle further complements 
the situation. The problem is more among children from higher socio-
economic sections of our society.

Type II diabetes and hypertension, earlier rare among children, are 
becoming more common among youngsters nowadays. This is attributed 
to the rise in childhood obesity.

Under nutrition still remains a serious health hazard among lower 
socio-economic groups. Children from poor families go to school on an 
empty stomach. The result is that these malnourished children are not 
likely to perform well in school. Instead they are at a greater risk of 
morbidity and mortality.

The mid-day meal scheme (MDMS) implemented by our government 
provides free lunch to school children from Classes I–VIII. The scheme has 
shown very good results. Teachers report that classroom performance and 169
attention spans of children have improved significantly. Not only has this 
school enrolment increased but drop-out rate has declined too. MDMS 
has been shown to reduce the gender gap in education by boosting female 
attendance. 

In our country we face the dual problem of undernutrition as well as 
over-nutrition. So if we continue to spread the benefits of healthy nutrition 
it will have an impact in the long run. Besides “School Health” programmes 
providing free health checks and treatment will increase overall well-being 
of children. 

The overall development of children requires concerned care and quality 
education. This is what will be discussed in the next chapter.

Key terms and their meaning

Complementary feeding: Inclusion of other foods to the infant’s diet in addition 
to breast milk
Malnutrition: Refers to both undernutrition and overnutrition. In undernutrition 
the body suffers due to lack of nutrients and in overnutrition the body suffers due 
to excess of nutrients.
Obesity: Deposit of excess fat in the body leading to body weight rising above 
normal levels. This is caused by intake of more calories than can be spent on 
body metabolism and physical activity.

Learning Objectives
 
After completing this chapter the learner is able to —
•	 discuss the clothing functions and the factors influencing 

selection of clothes. 
•	 identify general clothing needs of the children.

171
•	 recognise the characteristic features and clothing 

requirements of children from different age groups.
•	 discuss the clothing needs of children with special needs.

	 When you meet people for the first time what impacts you the most? Their clothing, 
or face or their personality or all of these? Our posture, walk, smile or frown and 
other forms of body language contribute to the impression we create. Actually of 
all these aspects clothing creates the first impression. We recognise that good 
appearance is important. In order to appreciate the true importance of dress or 
clothing we need to discover how we feel about the clothes we wear.

9.1	 Clothing Functions and the 
Selection of Clothes 

Look at the clothes you are wearing today and think about why you are 
wearing them. May be it was the weather that determined what you chose 
or the kind of activity in the school that you were to perform or may be the 
function you were to attend with your family or friends, or for no particular 
reason. 

We all wear clothing and we wear different types of clothing. Let us 
begin to understand why we select the clothing we wear. At the same

Human Ecology and Family Sciences

time let us gain some insight into other people’s reasons for their clothing 
choices.

Modesty

Probably the most obvious reason for wearing clothes is simply that in 
our society, people do not go around without them; we wear clothing for 
modesty. You probably know that young children do not feel embarrassed 
going about without any clothing. The need to have their bodies covered is 
something that they are taught.

Ideas about modesty are shaped by the society in which we live. What 
is considered modest in one society might not be considered as modest 
in another. For example in some communities women not covering heads 
may be considered as a sign of immodesty, whereas, in other communities 
women not covering their legs is thought to be immodest.  

Protection 

We wear clothing to protect ourselves from the environment – from harsh 
weather conditions, dirt and pollution. We change our clothing according 

172 to the different seasons. In hot summer months we wear light weight 
cotton clothes and may even cover our heads to protect ourselves from the 
scorching sun, whereas in winter months we cover ourselves in layers of 
woollen clothing for protection.

Clothing can also protect us from physical harm. Fire fighters wear 
special clothing for protection from fire, smoke and water. Many sports 
activities such as football, hockey and cricket require clothing that is 
specially designed to protect the players from injury. You must have 
noticed the arm guards, leg guards, wrist bands that these players wear 
along with their normal dress for special protection.

Activity 1

Can you identify the clothing that is needed in the rainy season? What type of fabrics, 
garments and accessories are needed in that weather? Make a list and discuss with 
your friends.

Status and prestige 

Clothes can also be a sign of status. It used to be true that you could identify 
people’s social and economic status by their clothing. You may have seen 
in certain historical films that the king’s and courtesan’s clothing are quite 
different from the common people’s clothing.  Everybody’s sense of identity 

Reprint 2025-26

unit_3_as_26_7_09_cyan-Final.indd   172 2/9/2023   12:09:46



Our Apparel

includes a feeling of social status or prestige, and the manner of dress 
is one way by which this can be accomplished. In India on festivals and 
important family events people wear clothes that may reflect their social 
status. 

However, as more and more stylish clothing become available at 
reasonable prices, today many more young people can afford to buy them. 
Thus, as similar kinds of clothing (T-shirt, jeans, salwar-kurta) become 
available for all ages and economic levels, these also serve as social class 
levellers, a step towards social equity in a democratic society. 

Adornment

What about wearing clothes just because you want to look attractive? Yes, 
we wear good clothes to enhance our appearance.  The need to decorate 
and adorn the body seems to be one of the more universal drives of 
men and women and can be found to some degree in all societies. Ear 
piercing, nail polishing, tattooing, hair braiding and knotting are forms of 
body decoration still used. The desirability of each type of adornment is 
determined by the society.  

 There is a vast range of fabrics available in the market, a large 
number of which are used for clothing and apparel. In an earlier chapter 173
(Chapter 7) you learnt about these fabrics in terms of their fibre content, 
yarn and fabric types and the finishes applied during production. Thus, 
you can relate the fabric characteristics with their suitability for diverse 
usages and care requirements. Selection of the type of clothing and apparel 
not only takes into consideration the fabric characteristics but also the 
right style of garment and its accessory details. Having earlier discussed 
the reasons for wearing clothes, let us look at the clothing needs and 
selection of clothing for different age groups.

9.2	 Factors Affecting Selection of 
Clothing in India  

Assessment of clothing needs and the final decision in the selection is 
dependent on the geographical features, climate and seasonal features of 
the area where they have to be used. It is also affected by easy availability, 
cultural influences and even more strongly the family traditions. In general, 
the factors that affect selection of clothing can be summarised as follows–

Age

Age is an important factor to be considered at all stages of life. It becomes 
more important while selecting clothes and apparel for children, since it is 

Reprint 2025-26

unit_3_as_26_7_09_cyan-Final.indd   173 2/9/2023   12:09:46



Human Ecology and Family Sciences

parents or elders of the family who are taking the decision regarding their 
clothes. It is important to remember that children, specially infants and 
toddlers, are not dolls to be dressed up and decorated for the satisfaction 
of adults. Their physical growth, motor development, association with 
people and things around them and activities they indulge in, all have to 
be taken into consideration from the point of view of comfort and safety.

As children grow, their association and interaction with people outside 
their immediate family increases. They become aware of clothes that other 
people wear and how others view their clothes. Conformity to peers begins 
to become important in middle childhood and increases in importance with 
age.  Clothes and apparel play an important role in helping the growing child 
feel a sense of belonging and acceptance. As children grow, their clothing 
changes and clothing for girls and boys becomes different. Approaching 
adolescence, the rapid physical growth brings about even further gender 
differentiation in clothing. The adolescents also start recognising cultural 
and societal norms as well as contemporary trends which influence their 
selection of clothes. They are often convinced that their popularity and 
relationships in a group are dependent on appearance, which in turn is 
due to the “right clothes.”

174 Climate and season

In the previous section you read that protection from environment 
and weather is one of the main reasons for wearing clothes. Hence the 
selection of clothing for children has to be suited to the climate. Clothing 
requirements for cold climate or season would be very different from warm 
or temperate climate and even for areas with heavy rains or high humidity. 
When some types of clothes and fabrics are suitable only for 3–4 months in 
a year, their cost and quantity has to be considered carefully. This is more 
important for growing children because they would have outgrown them 
by the next season. 

Occasion 

Selection of clothes also depends a lot on the occasion and time of the 
day. There are also unwritten rules and traditions for clothing for each 
occasion. Most schools have dress uniforms and rules regarding not 
wearing accessories and ornaments. In schools, where it is not compulsory 
to wear a uniform, very formal, very dressy or very sporty clothes can 
cause disciplinary problems for children. They may become objects of 
ridicule by their peers or may be deterred from joining group activities 
whole heartedly.

Social get-togethers and parties are the occasions when children like 
to use ‘nice’ apparel to highlight their individuality. At family functions 

Reprint 2025-26

unit_3_as_26_7_09_cyan-Final.indd   174 2/9/2023   12:09:46



Our Apparel

such as a wedding even children may have to follow the traditional norms 
and wear something suitable. In most communities, rites and ceremonies 
associated with the passage of life continue to follow traditional, some 
time modified, norms. The clothing selection is reflected not only in the 
style of dress, but also in the choice of fabric type and texture, colour and 
accessories. Concepts of clothing in terms of modesty and protection vary 
with occasion, activity and time of the day. Wearing the right thing at the 
right time is most important. 

Fashion

The term ‘fashion’ is identified with a style which has contemporary 
appeal for the masses. With children’s constant exposure to TV, even they 
become quite fashion conscious. Fashion may be inspired by important 
personalities, social or political leaders, film stars or even important 
national events. These can be reflected in apparel in terms of fabric types, 
colour and design of the material, shape or cut of the garment or simply the 
accessories (like scarves, bags, badges, belts, etc.) that go with it. Certain 
fashions that highly exaggerate some features of dress or may affect only 
part of the society, or a specific area are very short lived. These are known 
as ‘fads’. Children and adolescents are quite likely to be taken up by fads. 175

Income

The amount of money available also affects the selection of clothing. This is 
reflected not only in the initial cost while purchasing it, but also in its use 
for varied purposes, durability, and care and maintenance requirements. 
The number of children in a family, their age gaps and gender may also 
affect the final choice. Families of high-income group often have greater 
variety in clothing, specially with reference to special occasions. In families 
with modest or low income, the clothes of older siblings are recycled and 
worn by younger ones to economise on the expenditure on clothes. 

One reason why schools prescribe a uniform dress for children is to de-
emphasise the socio-economic differences among students.

9.3	 Understanding Children’s basic 
Clothing Needs  

As children grow, they like to identify with their peers and or adults 
whom they admire. One way of doing that is to dress like them. This is an 
emotional experience for them.  Children’s clothes must be suitable for 
their different activities, and must give them freedom to play, something 
that is so essential for their physical growth. The clothing needs of children, 

Reprint 2025-26

unit_3_as_26_7_09_cyan-Final.indd   175 2/9/2023   12:09:46



Human Ecology and Family Sciences

from infancy to adolescence, are discussed below in detail.

Comfort

The most important requirement for children is comfort. They need to roll, 
crawl, squat, climb, run and jump without being hindered by clothes. They 
need to play without fear of getting their clothes dirty. Tight clothes are avoided 
as they restrict activity and even interfere with natural blood circulation. 
Similarly elastic bindings should not be so tight as to cause pain. 

Heavy and bulky clothes are difficult to handle and tiring for children. 
Select lightweight clothes that are made of acrylic and nylon fibres, 
especially for winter apparel, to keep warm. Children need to bend 
and stoop often, so sufficient ease is essential in the crotch to allow for 
comfortable movement. Clothes that hang from shoulders are generally 
more comfortable than those hanging from waistline. Necklines have to be 
wide enough so that there is no strain across the throat. Similarly sleeves 
with bands at the end are irritable as it restricts free movement. 

Essentially, be sure that fabrics are soft and absorbent, suitable for the 
child’s sensitive skin. Organdy collars for girls’ frocks and heavily starched 
shirts for little boys are uncomfortable to wear. Clothes that are too large 

176 can be as uncomfortable as those that are too small. To avoid this, select 
garments that fit but have enough allowance for child’s growth. Regarding 
sleeves, raglan sleeves provide for more freedom as well as growth than 
set-in fitted sleeves.

Safety

Comfort and safety go hand-in-hand for children’s clothing. Clothes 
which are too large may be uncomfortable and may also be unsafe. Loose 
garments can catch on fire more easily (than fitting clothes) around the 
cooking area. Hanging sashes and trims can get caught in the moving 
parts of the tricycle or objects. As bright colours can be more easily seen 
by motorists than dark and gray colours, it is advisable to use such colours 
for children’s clothing. Loose buttons and trims are unsafe for infants and 
toddlers who put every thing into their mouth.

Self-help

Dressing and undressing themselves give children a feeling of confidence 
and self-reliance. Many of children’s clothes are too difficult to put on or 
take off by the children themselves. Remember, it becomes frustrating for 
a child who wants to dress on her/his own.

The most essential self-help feature is the opening in a dress. This must 

Reprint 2025-26

unit_3_as_26_7_09_cyan-Final.indd   176 2/9/2023   12:09:46



Our Apparel

be large enough so that the child can get in and out of the garment easily. 
Front openings are easier to handle. Buttons should be large enough to 
be grasped by a child’s hand. Front and back side of the dress should 
look different so that the child can learn to identify it easily. Small snaps, 
hooks and eyes, and bows tied at the waist or the neck and small buttons 
with thread loops retard the self-help features in a dress.

Appearance

Children have their own ideas about their clothing and they should be 
allowed to express their preferences. Exercising some choice at the younger 
ages will help them develop their ability to select appropriate clothes. 
Bright colours for outer wear make it easier to spot a child on the play 
ground or street. Lines should highlight desirable features and camouflage 
undesirable ones. Fabric designs should be in scale with smaller figures. 
Usually small checks, strips, plaids and dainty prints are best. Although 
large designs may be interesting, often they overpower the small child 
wearing it. 

Allowance for growth
177

Children’s clothing should have allowance for growth, especially in length. 
It is not advisable to buy a much larger size as they are neither comfortable 
nor safe. It is better to choose clothes to fit with the provision to increase 
length. Select fabrics which do not shrink. Trousers can have cuffs at the 
hemline which can be later let down to increase the leg length. Adjustable 
straps on skirts are a must. Raglan sleeves allow for growth better than set-
in sleeves. Tucks and pleats at the shoulder line can allow for increasing 
width.

Easy care  

Children are happier if they do not have to be worried about getting their 
clothes dirty. Even mothers appreciate easy care clothes, ones which can 
be easily washed and need little or no ironing. Flat seams are essential 
as they wear longer than plain seams.  Areas of strains as knees, pocket 
corners and elbows can be reinforced.

Fabrics

Soft, firmly woven or knitted fabrics that are easy to care for, comfortable 
to skin, that do not wrinkle or soil readily, are the desirable fabrics for 
children’s clothing. Avoid clothing which must be drycleaned. Printed

fabrics, corduroy and textured fabrics show less wrinkles and soil. Cotton 
is the most widely used fabric as it is easily washable and comfortable to 
wear. Wool is warm but requires special care; it may irritate children’s 
delicate skin, and hence must not be worn next to skin. Polyester, nylon 
and acrylic clothes wear well and are cared for easily. A blend of cotton 
and polyester is often more comfortable for a child than pure polyester, as 
it is more absorbent.

Activity 2

Observe children of various age groups and note what clothing they wear at ages 	
2 years, 5 years, 8 years, 11 years and 16 years. 

9.4	 Clothing requirements at different 
childhood stages  

We have seen the general clothing needs of the children in the last section. 
Each stage of childhood has specific characteristics that need to be kept 
in mind while selecting their clothes. 

178
Infancy (birth to six months) 

During the early months the most important factors are warmth, comfort 
and hygiene. At this age, infants are basically feeding, sleeping and 
eliminating. Hence the clothes must be comfortable. One can stitch or 
select clothes which open down the front or have large openings to avoid 
slipping the dress over their heads. Also, draw strings, especially around 
the neck, should be avoided as these can get entangled. The fasteners 
used can be placed so that they can be reached easily and they can be of a 
kind that will not injure the baby in any way. It is advisable to have plenty 
of garments that need to be changed often like shirts and diapers.

Physically at this stage, the baby’s skin is very delicate and sensitive 
and thus would demand very soft, light-in-weight and simple-to-put-on

and take-off clothes. The fabrics with sizing are not suitable for the babies 
as it might scratch the skin. Even all wool flannel fabrics for winters would 
be irritating to the skin, thus a baby flannel, a mix of wool and cotton or 
silk is preferred. Infants grow very fast at this stage so it is advisable not 
to buy too many clothes in smaller sizes. 

Diapers are the first and most essential requirement for infants. These 
have to be soft, absorbent, easily washed and quick drying. It is quite 
common for families to make cotton diapers at home. If old cotton sheets 
are used for the purpose, they need to be well sterilised and disinfected. 
Many families have replaced home made diapers with ‘gauze’ and bird’s 
eye diapers that are available in the market. Pre-shaped diapers are also 
available but one should be certain about the fit for the baby.

Undershirts are worn in 
most climates; depending 
on the weather and 
geographical location, the 
material for the undershirt 
should be selected suitably. 
Cotton undershirt is 
suitable for warm climate 
and soft wool-cotton blend 179
shirts are suitable in cold 
climate. Usually, shirts 
and diapers form the basic 
garments for the infant. Figure 2: Pre-shaped diapers

Cotton shirts in various 
styles that slip on easily are preferred.

In rural areas, it has been observed that infants wear clothes which are 
simple and homemade from used materials.

Creeping age (6 months to one year)

This is the stage when the child begins to show signs of independence. It is 
very interesting to see babies pull themselves up to the furniture to stand, 
trying to reach out to objects, to sit or stand on their own. You will notice 
that all these activities would need clothes for protection and comfort.

Apparel for children in this age group has to be such that it 
allows for free movement. Thus, the basic clothing needs are loose and 
non-interfering garments. For clothes to fit loosely, both knitted and bias 
cut garments are most suited as they stretch allowing for some growth. As 
this is the stage to develop good posture, care must be taken in selection 
of right clothes. Too much bulk can hamper motor movement. Light weight 
garments are preferred over tightly knitted or woven ones. These would

be easier during play and will also be comparatively warmer to enmesh 
air, specially in winters. Do not make children wear too many clothes. The 

Figure 3: Comfortable clothes for crawling age

clothes should be made of suitable fabric, i.e., one that is soft, smooth 
and does not collect soil readily. They should be easy to care for, i.e., 
wash and iron. Some fabrics like knits and seersuckers (crimpled striped 
material) are excellent as they do not require ironing. Some cottons and 
rayons are wrinkle resistant as they are treated with special finishes. 
As children spend most of their time playing, their clothes may require 
frequent changes as these would get soiled. It is thus important to look 

180 at the feature of convenient openings in the garment to slip off and put 
on easily. 

Most suitable garments for this age are rompers and sun-suits made 
from knitted or woven material.

Figure 4: Apparel designs suitable for crawling age

While selecting these garments it is important to keep in mind the 
features of size and looseness so that the garment does not come in the 
way of the child’s movements. During the crawling stage, soft-soled shoes 
may be worn if protection from the cold is needed. Training pants are often 
worn when toilet training begins. These are made of fabrics that fit snuggly 
at the hip.

Toddlerhood (1–2 years)

If you observe a few children in this age-group and you will notice that they 
are very active. They need freedom to play indoors as well as outdoors. They 
want to do most of the things themselves. Now as they start walking, they 
want to reach out for anything they see. At this stage shoes or footwear 
become a very essential part of the clothing. The correct fit in shoes and 
socks for a small child is essential for foot comfort and health. The principle 
clothing concern in the toddler age is the selection of shoes. When walking 
begins, flexible soled shoes with rough soles of 1 inch thickness are worn.

8
These may be without heel or a slight heel, and should be full and puffy 
in the toe area. 

Shoes should be selected and fitted carefully because the soft bones of 
a child’s foot may be injured by wrong fitting or badly shaped shoes. One 
must be sure to consider the length, width, height of toe space and fit of 
the heel.

181

Figure 5: Correct fit of Shoe

For correct fit, they should be fitted on the child. The shoes that fit 
well help to build good body skills in balance, climbing and running. As 
children outgrow their shoes quickly, shoes need replacement frequently 
to avoid foot related health dangers.

For toddlers overalls are the most suitable dresses. These need to be 
large at the crotch to allow for diapers. By the time children are 2 years old, 
they want to dress on their own. Then it is important to select garments 
with self-help features that have been listed earlier.

Activity 3

Make a size chart of toddlers according to weight and height by measuring four children 
in this age group, two girls and two boys.

Preschool age  (2–6 years)

Like other age groups, health and comfort of preschoolers is an important 
consideration in selection of their clothes. Clothes have to be selected 
suitably for these children as they play a lot, and the garments should be 
able to withstand the wear and tear that the average child will give them. 
Clothes should be made from light weight materials that are pre-shrunk 
and are easy to care.  Cotton is the most suitable fabric for preschoolers. 
It is hygienic, absorbent and easy to launder.

The design features on the ready-to-wear preschooler’s dress must 
provide ease in care. Sometimes dresses have trimmings that make the 
garment difficult to wash and iron. It should be such that it can withstand 
many launderings and hard wear. Be sure that fasteners and trimmings 
are securely attached, decorations are easy to iron, and seams are flat and 
well finished.

182

Figure 6: Apparel for preschoolers

Children in this age grow rapidly so it is important to make or buy only 
few garments that will serve for all occasions and purposes. While buying 
expensive clothes, look for growth features as discussed in the previous 
section. This will enable a garment to be worn over a longer period of time. 

Preschoolers may have definite preference for colours and styles.  They 
start showing interest in their clothing. Personality plays an important role 
in children’s choice of clothing. Some girls prefer feminine style and like 
to wear frocks with frills. Preschool boys may not be as dress conscious 
as girls, but they like to dress like other boys and be comfortable. It has 
been observed that, at this stage, girls are permitted to wear pants/jeans/
shorts like boys, although the opposite is not true for boys.

Reprint 2025-26

Individuality of each child should be respected through clothes, even 
if they are twins.  Identical twins should not be dressed alike unless they 
wish to. It is important that preschoolers be given a chance to express 
their choice while making a purchase for their clothing. 

Self-help features are important for both child and the mother. These 
features help the child to become more independent and self-reliant. The 
desirable features of preschoolers’ dresses are one piece garment with 
front long openings that can be easily reached, large buttons, large and 
comfortable necklines without collar and large armholes.

In brief, clothes for preschoolers should be comfortable to wear, easy 
to maintain, durable to use that provide allowance for growing needs, look 
attractive in design and colour, and encourage self-reliance.

Elementary School Years (6–11 years)

As you read in the previous chapter this is the stage of middle childhood. 
It is a period of heightened physical activity, and both boys and girls are 
interested in sports. Clothing now plays an important role in their social 
and emotional development.

They  develop   likes 
and dislikes for 183
certain clothes to gain 
acceptance from their 
peers, and parents 
need to understand this 
developmental change. 
A sensitive child may 
experience humiliation 
and develop lack of 
confidence if her/his 
clothes appear very 
different from those of 
her/his peers. Figure 7: Sporty and comfortable dresses for 5–8 Years

Comfortable clothing is essential at this age too. Boys now are very 
active and prefer wearing rugged clothes that can withstand their rough-
and-tumble play. Girls may prefer ‘boyish’ clothes or may opt for feminine 
dresses.

Most children can select what they want to wear, and resent suggestions 
from parents.  

Fitting is an important aspect to be considered while selecting clothing 
for school children. A poor fit dress is often discarded by the children. 
However, some children may select a dress on the basis of style even if it 
is not comfortable.

To cater to their 
physical needs the 
children would 
require absorbent 
fabrics so as to 
absorb perspiration. 
Most suitable fabrics 
are cotton, voile, etc. 
Factors like safety, 
easy care, growth 
allowance and 
suitability to their 
physique are also 
important for school Figure 8: Comfortable clothing for elementary school age group
going children, just 
like younger children as has been discussed in the previous sections.

Adolescents (11–18 years)

During adolescent years, growth is very rapid and different parts of the 
184 body grow at different rates. In early adolescence, a minimal wardrobe is 

advisable at any one time, since the child is going to outgrow the clothes 
very quickly.

The qualities in clothes that are most important to teenagers are fit and 
style. They may not be guided by the quality of fabric or its construction. 

Adolescents not only wear new styles, they also create new styles. They 
are earnest followers of fashion and fads. They would like to spend large 
sums of money for their clothing. Dressing the way peers are dressed or 
imitating their role models in dress is a sign of their struggle for a sense 
of identity.

When dressing up for sports or workouts, one should make choice of 
clothes and shoes that are comfortable and prevents such problems as 
strains, blisters, sprains and sore legs and ankles. Fabrics should be easy 
to wash, as simple hygiene can save the skin from irritation and rashes. 
Garment design and fabric should allow for free movement and absorption 
of perspiration.

9.5	 Clothes for Children with Special 
Needs

You would now agree that apart from protection, clothing provides an 
opportunity to the child to develop a sense of autonomy and competence. It 
communicates impressions of the self to others in the social environment. 
Sometimes children with disability may have limited physical movement, 
but they have all the potential for learning and growing.

The task of dressing and undressing is very important for children 
with special needs. Depending on the nature of disability, some children 
are able to dress themselves independently. This gives them emotional 
satisfaction and also a feeling of pride. But if the child is severely disabled 
or incontinent, she/he is helped by the carer, making the process time 
consuming and tiresome. 185

Garments for children with special needs are selected according to the 
type of disability and the associated difficulties. As comfort is the primary 
criterion, cotton is the most preferred fabric for summer, and velvet 
corduroy and cotswool for winter. The garments selected should be strong 
so as to withstand abrasion in case the children use orthotic devices or 
wheel chairs. Garments should have reinforcements at specified areas 
for calipers and braces. Openings should be easily accessible and easy 
to fasten. Hence, velcros and zippers with key chains are good choices. 
Needless to say, garments should be easy to wash. Wearing and taking off 
should be simple, and so wider necklines, waist belts with elastics, front 
open plackets and front pockets can be the preferred choices. 

It’s very important to look at the aesthetic appeal of the clothes. They 
should look like clothes for any child, well-stitched yet easy to wear. They 
should be appealing in colour and print so that the wearer feels good. 
However, the best garment is the one that is constructed to cater to the 
individual needs of the wearer and carer.

On the whole, this chapter informs us that what children wear, i.e., 
their apparel, has an important role in their personality development. The 
clothes not only must be appealing to the eye and comfortable to wear, but 
also ecologically and socio-culturally appropriate. 

With this chapter we conclude the unit on childhood. Having studied 
adolescence in the first two Units, we now move to adulthood from the 
next section, i.e., Unit IV.

Learning Objectives
 
After completing this chapter the learner is able to —
•	 understand the meaning and concept of financial management.
•	 know the different types of income. 
•	 explain the steps in making family budgets.

188 •	 describe meaning of savings and investments. 
•	 discuss the principles of sound investments.

10.1 Introduction
(i) Financial management in the context of a family simply means 

management of finances. Finances are all types of income available to 
a family which include salary, wages, rent, interest, dividends, bonus, 
retirement benefits and all other forms of monetary receipts. Planning, 
controlling and evaluating the use of all these types of incomes is 
called financial management. Its purpose is to give the family greatest 
satisfaction from the resources at hand. 

	 	 The quality of living that can be exchanged for financial resources 
is dependent not only on how much income is available, but more 
importantly on the regularity and stability of income. Therefore, it is 
important to learn the skill of managing money as a resource. This 
chapter will deal with the types of family income, management of 
income and the steps in making family budgets.  

(ii) Financial planning is a component of financial management. The term 
budget is often used for the planning stage in financial management. 
When families make budgets, they see to it that the family income 
is used in a manner that fulfills all the present needs of the family 
members and also takes care of the long term goals of the family. Thus

Financial Management and Planning

families are able to achieve their objectives by optimising the use of their 
resources. In addition, financial planning minimises wastage of money 
on non-essentials, thus making families save a part of their income 
for future use. This is, however, possible when the family monitors its 
financial plans and evaluates the plans from time to time. Commitment 
of family members towards the success of the financial plan is very 
important for it to show any results. 

		  Management is using what you have (resources) to achieve what 
you want (goals and objectives). Family resources are the resources 
that are available to the individual or the family at a particular time, 
which help them reach their family goals. Family resources include 
human resources such as knowledge, skills, health, time and energy; 
material resources such as housing, money and investments; and 
community resources such as the library, parks, community centres, 
hospitals, etc. In order to ensure maximum utilisation of resources it 
is important to manage them well. 

	 	 A family is a consumption unit while being a social unit, and its 
purpose is to manage the finances of the family for the well-being of 
its members. Money is one of the important family resources. A family 
cannot lead a comfortable life without sufficient money. Managing 
money effectively to meet present needs and future goals is a learned 189
skill. So let us understand what we mean by family income.

10.2 Family Income 
Family income means the sum total of the income of all types and from 
all sources of all the family members in a given time period. It can be 
annual, monthly, weekly or daily income. However, for official purposes, it 
is considered as the annual income in a financial year which is generally 
from 1st April to 31st March of the next year.
Income may be in the form of

Types of family income

There are three types of family income.

Real
Income

Money Psychic
190 Income Income

Before we go into the details of different types of family income, let us 
understand what is money and its functions.
Money is what money does. Two most important functions of money are:
•	 Serving as a medium of exchange, and 
•	 Measurement of value

Thus money is “anything which is generally acceptable in exchange 
of commodities and in terms of which the value of other commodities is 
determined”. 

Importance of money
•	 Money serves as a medium of exchange, thus doing away with the 

problems of spending time for exchange to materialise.
•	 Money serves as a standard of value, i.e., a common denominator in 

terms of which the value of all other commodities is expressed. 
•	 It works as a standard of deferred payments facilitating savings and 

investments, which are the basis for capital formation, and hence for 
better standard of living.

•	 Storage in terms of money is durable for long time periods, facilitating 
accumulation for investment in production and improved standard of 
living for the family.

time. It comes to the family 
in the form of wages, salary, 
bonus, commission, rent, dividends, interest, retirement income, 
royalties and any other allowances to any member of the family. Money 
income is converted into goods and services required for daily living, and 
often a part is diverted into savings for delayed use or for investment 
purposes. 

	 	 The frequency and pattern of flow of money income varies from 
family to family. For example in rural areas agriculture is the main 
occupation. The income of a farmer is not regular but she/he earns 
money when she/he sells the crop which may be twice in a year–the 
rabi and the kharif crops. In contrast, a person having a job will have 
regular income every month.

(b) Real Income is defined by economists as a flow of commodities and 
services available for satisfaction of human wants and needs over a 
given period of time. 

This definition has three important points, namely: 191

•	 Real income is a flow of goods and services, it is not stagnant.
•	 It consists of goods and services which might or might not be 

available with money, e.g., produce from your own land, services 
of a household.

•	 There is a time period involved – it may be a month or a year. 

Real income is of two types- direct income and indirect income

1.	 Direct Income – consists of those goods and services available 
to the family members without the use of money. For example, 
services rendered by family members, like cooking, laundering, 
stitching, maintaining kitchen garden, etc. A house which is fully 
paid for and community facilities like parks, roads, libraries also 
come under direct income.

2.	 Indirect Income – those material goods and services which are 
available to the family only after some means of exchange (ordinarily 
money) has been obtained, e.g., use of money to buy good quality 
vegetables because it involves one’s skill and ability to select. 

(c) Psychic Income is the satisfaction that results from the ownership 
and utilisation of goods and services. It can also be defined as the 
satisfaction derived from real income. It is difficult to quantify psychic 
income in terms of rupees. It is a form of hidden income. It is intangible 
and subjective and the most important in terms of quality of living.

10.3 Income Management 
Income management may be 
defined as planning, controlling Activity 3
and evaluating the use of all types 
of income. Its purpose is to simply Identify the different sources of direct

the resources at hand.

No two families, even though they have identical incomes, will have 
identical needs and desires. Thus every family must devise their own plan 
of expenditure keeping in mind their goals, needs and desires. For efficient 
income management it is essential that families recognise and analyse all 
resources available to them.

10.4 Budget 
Budget is the most common planning device for the use of money. A 
budget is a plan for future expenditure. It represents the first step in the 
managerial process as applied to money. Its success depends upon  
•	 its being realistic and flexible. 

192 •	 suitability to the group for which it is prepared.
•	 quality of the control and evaluation steps which follow. 

A family budget gives in detail the income and the expenditure of a 
family for a month or a year. It mentions all the sources of income during 
the period and also all the items of expenditure under different headings, 
such as food, clothing, housing, entertainment, travel, education, health 
and medicine and savings. 

Steps in making a budget

 There are mainly five steps in making a budget. They are as follows:
(i) List the commodities and services needed by the family members 

throughout the proposed budget plan. Group the related goods and 
services together. The following grouping may be helpful: 
•	 Food and related costs
•	 Housing 
•	 Household operations – fuel, utilities
•	 Education 
•	 Transportation
•	 Clothing 
•	 Income tax
•	 Medical
•	 Personal allowances

Financial Management and Planning

•	 Miscellaneous – recreation, house furnishings
•	 Provision for future – saving, retirement 

(ii) Estimate the cost of the desired items totaling each classification and 
the budget as a whole. General market trends must be considered while 
making these estimates. For example, if prices are showing an upward 
trend, sufficient margin should be allowed to cover such increases.  

(iii) Estimate total expected income. It is helpful to list income under 
two headings – assured and possible income. The budget should ensure 
that necessities are taken care from the assured income and the ‘nice 
but not necessary’ items can be obtained from possible income.   

(iv)	Bring expected income and expenditure into balance. Sometimes 
expenses are more than income. There are two ways to bring them into 
balance. One can either increase the income (for example by, taking up 
an extra job/work) or cut expenditures (less frequent outings or less 
expenditure on festivals).

(v) Check plans to see that they have a reasonable chance of success. The 
plans are checked in light of the following factors: 
•	 The needs of the family have been met.
•	 The budget allows for emergencies. A joint fund may be kept aside 

for emergency period. 
•	 Solvency is assured. Solvency is the ability to pay bills or debts as 193

they fall due. 
•	 The national and world-wide conditions have been considered (e.g., 

global economic recession).
•	 The long term goals of the family are recognised. 

Advantages of planning family budgets 

•	 Planning enables a family to take an overview of the use of their 
income.

•	 Amounts allocated to various categories can be studied in relation to 
total income.

•	 The budget helps families use their income to first attain those goals 
which they consider most important. Spending without a plan frequently 
results in wastage of income.   

•	 Family members are less likely to be swayed, as they can make rational 
decisions which are reflective of long term goals of the family. 

10.5 Control in Money Management
After planning, controlling is the next step in money management. Control 
in financial management is usually of two types: checking to see how well 
the plan is progressing and adjusting wherever necessary.

Checking is important as it tells how one’s plans are progressing and 
where adjustments are needed. There can be two kinds of checks:  
(i)	 Mental and mechanical checks: Mental checks are usually established 

by breaking the allocations into units which can be related to actual 
expenditures. For example, Rs. 1,000 may appear to be a large amount 
to a student, but when one realises that one must purchase a pair of 
shoes, a new dress for a festival and a few books all at one time, it is 
obvious that one must take extreme care in the selection and the price 
in light of the total money available. Thus, in mental checking one 
visualises clearly the items a specific amount must cover. 

	 	 A mechanical check is one in which you set aside a certain amount 
of money in cash to be used for a particular item. For example, many 
homemakers have a food purse in which monthly allocation for food is 
kept. All food expenses are carried out from the money in this envelope. 
Quick disappearance of the money shows how rapidly the money is 
being spent.  

(ii) Records and accounts: Records and accounts show the distribution 
of money after expenditures have been made.  Such records can be 
quite casual, such as keeping everyday written account or receipted 
bills, or they can consist of formal and detailed accounts. For a family

particular group of items. 
Advantages of record keeping for a family

•	 Monthly expenditure can be compared with the spending plan and show 
us where adjustments must be made to avoid excessive expenditure.

•	 Helps in identifying those categories or sub-categories where 
expenditure is too high or too low. This in turn enables us to make 
better future budgets.

•	 Some record keeping methods need bills and receipts to be maintained. 
Thus a proof of payment is at hand in case of a poor product or service 
if one wants to lodge a complaint.
Single sheet method is a simple and flexible method of record keeping. 

The record of expenses are kept on a single sheet (see Figure 1).
Adjusting the plan is very important to keep it on track. Adjustments 

may be needed if the original planning was poor because of factors beyond 
the family’s control like emergencies, family going on an unplanned 
shopping spree or inadequate checking mechanisms which do not tell the 
family that there is a considerable gap between the plan and its execution.

Evaluation is the final step in money management. The satisfaction 
derived from expenditures is one of the most important means for

determining the success of a budget. Evaluation is done in light of specific 
goals such as obtaining fair value of money spent, being able to pay bills 
when they fall due, providing for future and improving economic status of 
the family.

Records of expenditures may be kept on a single, double or multiple sheets. This 
method is simple and flexible. Also the sheet can be tacked on the back of a door or 
cabinet with a pencil hanging nearby, which makes it convenient. Although the double 
and multiple sheet methods can be more adequate than single sheet, yet if the single 
sheet is well worked out it may include essential data. Consider the following example

Savings means keeping aside a part of your money or other resource 
for use in future or for further production. Savings are important for a 
family to take care of their future needs. Savings are also important for 
any economy to survive and grow as savings lead to capital formation and 
accumulation. This happens when savings are put to productive use by 
starting a business or depositing money in banks and financial institutions 
which mobilise public savings and use them for productive use.  

Savings of a family depend on the ability to save and willingness to 
save. Ability to save depends on per capita income. Higher income families 
have a higher potential to save compared to low income families who have 
little to save after taking care of their basic needs. Willingness to save 
depends upon the long term goals of the family and how willing they may 
be to sacrifice some luxuries in the present to take care of the future.

Saving money is not easy. It takes discipline, planning, co–operation and 
hard work on the part of family members. But saving money is very important 
for family security and happiness. Saving for saving’s sake is futile. Savings 
have meaning only when the purpose is well-planned and understood by all 
family members and the money wisely invested for future use. 

10.7 Investment 
196

Investment implies using the money for further production. If savings are 
put under the folds of a saree or kept hidden in a pitcher, it is not going 
to result in investment. Savings have to be put to productive use in the 
economic sense to result in investment. Investments may be in two types 
of assets – physical assets and financial assets. Savings, if put into bank 
accounts, post offices, or financial credit societies institution, in shares and 
securities, insurance policies, etc., lead to formation of financial assets. 
They provide financial security to the family and are productive in economic 
terms. Savings in physical assets means using your savings to buy land, 
property, house, gold, household durables, etc. This kind of investment is not 
productive in the economic sense of the term and does not result in capital 
formation. However, it usually has 
long term positive returns. Activity 5

Principles underlying and investments that your family is making 
sound investments use of.

Families spend a lifetime accumulating savings. These savings must be 
invested wisely to give the family good returns and ensure that the money 
is safe and available to them when they need it.
Let us now discuss the principles underlying sound investments.
	 (i)	 Safety of the principal amount: The principal itself has to be safe if 

it is to earn interest or dividends. This principal is the most important 

Reprint 2025-26

unit_4_as_26_7_09_magenta-Final.indd (M).indd   196 2/9/2023   12:04:42



Financial Management and Planning

factor for sound investing.  Safety can be ensured by
•	 Owning securities in both government and private sectors like 

National Savings Certificate (NSCs), Public Provident Fund (PPF), 
Kisan Vikas Patra (KVPs), fixed deposits in banks

•	 Investing in companies in different geographical zones
•	 Owning shares and bonds in different companies
•	 Studying the market reputation of the issues of the securities
•	 Varying the kind of securities purchased – agricultural land, real 

estate, stocks, bonds, fixed deposits, etc.
•	 Understanding prevailing phase of business cycle

	 (ii)	 Reasonable rate of return: In general, the higher the rate of return 
on an investment, the greater the risk, i.e., safety of principal and 
rate of return are inversely related. To some people, particularly 
those depending upon investments as their major source of income, 
regularity of income is more important than a higher but fluctuating 
return. This is determined by the selection of securities. Therefore, 
before investing money one should compare the rate of interest and 
the associated risk under various schemes and options. 

	 (iii)	 Liquidity: It is the ability to convert the securities into cash without 
sacrificing value. The more liquid an investment is, the higher is its 
price, or in other words, the lower the return to the investor. Hence 197
income and liquidity must be balanced.

	 (iv)	 Recognition of effect of world conditions: Changes in business 
trends will affect both the amount of protection needed, the ease of 
providing it and the methods chosen to provide it. Considering the 
long time business trends, a family must recognise the effect of their 
savings on the entire economy. Their willingness or unwillingness to 
invest in business enterprises at various stages in the cycle may well 
have an effect in reducing the extremeness of the cycle. 

	 (v)	 Easy accessibility and convenience: While choosing an investment 
option for family funds, one must consider the knowledge required for 
its success. A family may choose an investment which might result 
in loss simply because they did not foresee the problems involved in 
the management of security or property acquired. 

	 (vi)	 Investing in needed commodities: The date on which an investment 
is to mature is important for a family that plans to have funds 
available for a known future need. Therefore, while investing money, 
families should purchase securities of lengths and durations so that 
they mature close to the time of the envisaged need or needs, e.g., for 
the child’s higher education. 

	(vii)	 Tax efficiency: Investments should be made in those instruments 
which lead to tax saving. A number of provisions in the Income Tax 
Act can be used to save taxes. Investment in insurance policies,

Human Ecology and Family Sciences

Employees Provident Fund, PPF, etc., have built-in tax rebates with 
a specific ceiling limit.     

	(viii)	 After investment service: While selecting an investment instrument, 
customer care or customer service must be a critical decision-making 
factor. Good customer care includes easy encashability of securities, 
good communication network, timely dispatch of interest or dividend 
warrants, timely disbursal of the due amount after completion of 
investment period, keeping the customer posted about changes in the 
policies, interest rate, etc. A customer-friendly company provides the 
needed support and protection to the investor as and when required. 

	 (ix)	 Time period: The “lock in” period is a critical aspect to be considered 
before deciding on an investment. The longer the period of investment 
the higher is the rate of return. For example in most fixed schemes the 
rate of interest is higher for long-term deposits compared to short-term 
deposits. Thus the investor must choose between a higher return with 
a longer waiting period or a comparatively lower return for a short lock-
in-period, based on the needs and requirements of his/her family. 

	 (x)	 Capacity: One should not invest beyond one’s capacity so that 
the investments can be free of undue hardships. It is important to 
balance present needs with future needs and security.

Financial Management and Planning

sometimes use credit to meet their needs or obligations. That is, families 
make use of credit to avail of goods and services whose initial cost is too 
high to bear at once. The word credit comes from the Latin word ‘CREDO’ 
meaning ‘I believe’. Credit means getting money, goods or services in the 
present and paying for them in the future. In reality, it is a process of 
postponed payment, a privilege for which we have to sometimes pay a very 
high rate. At any given time the use of credit increases purchasing power 
and thus makes possible the provision of more goods or services than the 
cash on hand would allow. Families should understand the nature and 
operation of credit since repayment of the amount borrowed, together with 
interest for its use, must eventually be made. 

Need for credit
Families use credit to meet needs or obligations. The need may be real or 
imaginary. If the initial cost of a commodity seems too large to save before 
the purchase is made, families borrow money to possess the commodity 
immediately; for example, land. The cost of the good is spread over a long 
period of time and the family can have the advantage of using the good 
during the payment period. Another reason for borrowing is to meet family 
emergencies like sickness of a family member. Families also borrow to 
meet obligations like marriage of children or performing rituals during 199
death of a member. A self-supporting and self-sufficient family can always 
use credit in emergencies and do so with a feeling of confidence. 

A lender will make a loan only when she/he believes that the borrower 
will repay the money she/he borrows. The lender may be a bank or any 
other financial institution. Their decision to give credit to individuals and 
families is governed by 4C’s, which are mentioned below.

4 Cs of credit
Character means willingness and determination to repay a loan as agreed,  
even though it is at greater cost and inconvenience than the borrower 
anticipated. 
	 Capacity means the ability to meet an obligation when it is due. 

Ordinarily capacity depends upon income. It is important to understand 
that the capacity of family to repay a loan depends not so much upon 
total income as upon the available margin over and above necessary 
expenses. The capacity of a family to repay a loan is determined by the 
difference between what the family receives and what it spends. 

	 Capital means net worth. A family’s capital is determined by the 
difference between what it owns and what it owes. The existence of this 
capital provides a margin of safety for the lender, since if the family’s 
income proves to be inadequate to repay the loan, it can draw upon its 
invested capital.

	 Collateral consists of specific units of capital which are pledged as

unit_4_as_26_7_09_magenta-Final.indd (M).indd   199 2/9/2023   12:04:42



Human Ecology and Family Sciences

security for a given loan. Usually these units are placed in the possession 
of the lender with the understanding that if the borrower fails to pay 
the loan as agreed, the lender is to reimburse himself in so far as he 
can from the sale of the pledged collateral.    
Commercial banks, cooperative banks and agricultural banks, credit 

unions, etc., are the main source of taking credit. One can also take credit 
from self-help groups of which one is a member. The members of this 
self-help group contribute some money every month and make a corpus 
amount. From this credit is given to the needy member based on her/his 
requirement and repaying capacity. These groups have members known 
to each other and hence no collateral is needed and the interest rate is 
nominal.

Before using credit the family should consider not only satisfaction 
gained by possession of the good or service but also future adjustments in 
family budget imposed by repayment of the loan. Managing credit includes 
determining when to use credit and when its use has become excessive. 
Credit is a useful resource when handled with an understanding of its 
potential and its cost. 

If used indiscriminately credit can be disastrous for a family. Avoiding 
use of credit and taking credit at the lowest possible cost should be the 

200 first target for most families.
Let us conclude this chapter with an understanding that money and 

other financial resources can be multiplied and optimally used if certain 
measures, mentioned in the chapter, are adopted. As adult members of 
family, most people have to take care of many things. One such area in 
daily living is care of clothes and fabrics in the home. If fact, one can learn 
about the care of one’s clothes from a young age. Let us read about this in 
the next chapter.

Care and 
Maintenance of 11
Fabrics

Learning Objectives
 
After completing this chapter the learner is able to —
•	 understand the aspects of care and maintenance of different 

fabrics. 
•	 know the procedure of removing different stains.
•	 identify the process of laundry. 203
•	 describe the role of water, soaps and detergents in laundering.
•	 describe use and care of the fabric in relation to their 

properties.

11.1 Introduction
You learnt in some of the previous chapters about the significance of fabrics 
around us. They protect and enhance humans and their surroundings. 
Care and maintenance of fabric products, e.g., clothing, furnishing, or 
any other use within the household, is very important. Final selection and 
purchase of any product or material is largely based on its appearance in 
terms of colour and texture, its quality and its functionality. It therefore 
becomes very important that these characteristics are retained for the 
expected life of the material. Care and maintenance may thus include: 
•	 keeping the material free of physical damage; 
•	 retaining its appearance:

–	 Removal of stains and dirt without damaging its colour 
–	 Retaining or refurbishing its brightness and textural characteristics 

such as softness, stiffness or crispness 
–	 Keeping it free of wrinkles or retaining creases or removing wrinkles 

and adding creases where required

Human Ecology and Family Sciences

11.2	Mending 
Mending is the general term we use when we try to keep the material free 
of damage occurring in normal use or due to accident. It includes the 
following.     
–	 Repairing cuts, tears, holes 
–	 Replacing buttons/fasteners, ribbons, laces or fancy attachments
–	 Restitching seams and hems if they open up

These are best taken care of as and when they occur. It is absolutely 
essential that they be attended to before laundering as the strain of washing 
may lead to greater loss to the fabric.

11.3	Laundry
Every day care of the fabrics generally consists of washing to keep it clean 
and ironing to get a smooth wrinkle free appearance. Many materials often 
require special treatments to get rid of accidental stains, overcoming the 
grayness or yellowness that occurs due to repeated washings and adding 
stiffness or crispness. Laundering includes — stain removal, preparation of 

204 fabrics for washing, removing dirt from clothes by washing, finishing for its 
appearance (blueing and starching) and finally pressing or ironing for a neat 
appearance so that they can be stored ready for use.

 Stain Removal

A stain is an unwanted mark or colouration on a fabric caused by contact 
and absorption of foreign matter, which cannot be removed by normal 
washing process and requires special treatment.

In order to use the right procedure for removing the stain, it is important 
to identify the stain first. Identification may be done on the basis of colour, 
smell and feel. The stains can be classified as:
	 (i)	 Vegetable stains: tea, coffee, fruits, and vegetables.  These stains 

are acidic by nature and can be removed by alkaline medium.
	 (ii)	 Animal stains: blood, milk, meat, eggs, etc. These are protein in 

nature and removed by detergents in cold water only.
	(iii)	 Oil stains: oils, ghee, butter, etc. These are removed by the use of 

grease solvents and absorbents.
	(iv)	 Mineral stains: ink, rust, coal tar, medicine, etc.  These stains should 

be washed first in acidic medium and then in alkaline medium
	 (v)	 Dye bleeding: colour from other fabrics. These stains can be removed 

either by dilute alkalies or acids depending on the fabric type.

Care and Maintenance of Fabrics

Removal of Stains – General Considerations
yy Stain is best removed when fresh.
yy Identify the stain and use the right procedure for its removal.
yy For unknown stains, start with a simple process and move to a complex one.
yy Repeated use of milder reagent is better than one time use of a strong agent.
yy Wash all fabrics with soapy solution after stain removal to remove all traces of      

chemicals from it.
yy Dry fabrics in the sun as sunlight acts as natural bleach.
yy For delicate fabrics try out the chemicals on a small portion of fabric; if they damage 

the fabric, do not use them.

 (i)	Techniques of stain removal 
(a)	Scraping: built up surface stains can be scraped lightly using a 

blunt knife.
(b)	Dipping: The stained material is dipped into the reagent and 

scrubbed. 
(c)	 Sponging: The stained area is placed on a flat surface. The reagent 

is applied with a sponge on the stained area and absorbed by the 
blotting paper laid underneath. 205

(d)	Drop Method: The stained cloth is stretched over a bowl. The 
reagent is put on it with a dropper. 

(ii)	Stain removers/reagents for stain removal: The various reagents used 
for stain removal should be used in liquid form and in concentrations 
recommended for their use. These reagents can be grouped as follows: 
(a)	Grease solvents: Turpentine, kerosene, white petrol, methylated 

spirit, acetone, carbon tetra chloride 
(b)	Grease absorbents: Bran, Fuller’s earth, talcum powder, starch, 

French chalk 
(c)	 Emulsifiers: Soaps, detergents
(d)	Acidic reagents:  Acetic acid (vinegar), oxalic acid, lemon,  tomato, 

sour milk, curds 
(e)	 Alkaline reagents: Ammonia, borax, baking soda
(f)	 Bleaching agents: 

•	 Oxidising bleaches: Sunlight, sodium hypochlorite (javelle 
water), sodium perborate, hydrogen peroxide

•	 Reducing bleaches: Sodium hydrosulphite, sodium bisulphate, 
sodium thiosulphate

Care and Maintenance of Fabrics

(a)	These are the methods of removing stains from white cotton fabrics. Suitable 
precautions should be taken when applying on other fibres or on coloured 
materials.

(b)	Stain removal is the preparatory step in laundry. It must be followed by washing 
or dry-cleaning and all traces of chemicals used should be removed.                   

Removal of dirt – the cleaning process

Dirt is the term applied to grease, grime and dust jammed between the 
fabric structure. There are two types of dirt. One, which is held loosely 
onto the fabric and can be removed easily and the other, which is held 
tightly by means of sweat and grease. The loose dirt can be simply brushed 
or shaken off or will be removed by steeping in water. The tightly held 
grease can be loosened in steeping process, but requires reagents that 
will act upon the grease to loosen the dirt. There are three main methods 
of removing grease – by the use of solvents, absorbents or emulsifiers. 
When cleaning is done by solvents or absorbents it is called dry cleaning. 
Normal cleaning – washing is done in water with the help of soaps and 
detergents, which emulsify the grease (break it in to very small particles). 
This is then rinsed with water.
(i)  Water is the most valuable agent used for laundry work. There is a 207

certain adhesion between fabrics and water. During steeping water 
penetrates into the fabric and cause wetting.  Pedesis or the movement 
of water particles helps to remove the non-greasy dirt from the fabric.  
Washing in water alone, with agitation provided by hand or machine, will 
remove some loose dirt and particulate soils. Increase in temperature 
of the water increases its pedesis and its penetrating power. It is 
further beneficial when the dirt is greasy.  However, water alone cannot 
remove the dirt that is not soluble in water. It also does not have the 
ability to keep the dirt suspended resulting in the removed dirt getting 
redeposited on fabric.  Redeposition of dirt is the major cause of fabric 
graying over repeated launderings.

(ii)  Soaps and detergents are the most important cleansing agents used in 
laundry work. Soap result from a reaction between natural oils or fats 
and alkali. If alkali is used in excess it is released when soap is used on 
the fabric. Synthetic detergents are synthesised from chemicals. Both 
soaps and detergents are sold in powder, flake, bar and liquid forms. 
The type of soap or detergent to be used depends on the fibre content, 
colour and the type of dirt on the fabric.

	 	 Both soaps and detergents share a critical chemical property – they 
are surface–active agents or surfactants.  In other words, they reduce 
the surface tension of water. By reducing this effect water soaks more 
easily in clothes and removes stains and dirt faster.  Surfactants and 
other ingredients in laundry detergents also work to keep the removed

soils suspended in the wash water so they do not redeposit on to the 
clean fabrics.  This prevents graying of fabrics.  

	 	 There are some differences in soaps and detergents.  Soaps possess 
a number of qualities that make them preferable to detergents. 
As mentioned earlier, they are natural products and less harmful to 
the skin and environment. Soaps are biodegradable and do not create 
pollution in our rivers and streams.  On the other hand, soap is not 
effective in hard water, which results in wastage. Another shortcoming 
of soap is that it is less powerful than synthetic detergent and tends to 
lose its cleaning power over time. An added benefit of detergent is that 
they can be specifically engineered for each cleaning task and for use 
in different types of washing machines.

(iii)	Methods of washing: Once the soap or detergent has emulsified the 
grease holding the dirt, it has to be held in suspension till it is rinsed 
out. Some parts of the fabric may have dirt, which is closely adhering 
to the fabric. The methods employed for washing assist in these two 
tasks – disassociating the dirt adhering to the fabric and holding it in 
suspension. The method selected depends on the fibre content, the 
type of yarn and fabric construction and the size and weight of the 
article being washed. 

208 The methods of washing are classified as follows:
•	 Friction washing 
•	 Kneading and squeezing
•	 Suction
•	 Washing by machines

Let us now discuss these methods in detail.
(a)	Friction: This is the most commonly used method. This method of 

cleaning is suitable for strong fabrics like cottons. Friction may be 
caused by rubbing one part of the garment against another part of the 
garment with hands. Alternately using a brush over the dirty parts 
kept on the palm of the hand or on a scrubbing board if the article is 
big are also examples of friction washing.  Friction is not applied on 
delicate fabrics like silk and wool and on surfaces like pile, looped or 
embroidery. 

(b)	Kneading and squeezing: As the name suggests, this method involves 
gently rubbing with hands of the article in soap solution.  Since the 
pressure applied in this is very low, it does not harm the texture, colour 
or weave of the fabric. Thus the method can be easily used to clean 
delicate fabrics like wool, silk, rayon and coloured fabrics. This method 
would not be effective for heavily soiled articles.

(c)	 Suction washing: This method is used for articles like towels where 
brush cannot be used and when it is too big or heavy to be handled 
by kneading and squeezing technique. The article is placed in soap

solution in a tub and the suction washer is pressed down and lifted 
repeatedly. The vacuum created by pressing loosens dirt particles.

(d)	Machine washing: Washing machine is a labour saving device 
especially useful for large institutions, like hotels and hospitals. These 
days a variety of washing machines are available in the market by 
different companies.  The principle behind each is the same. This is to 
create agitation in the clothes to loosen the dirt.  For washing in these 
machines, pressure is provided by the movement of either the tub in the 
machine or a central rod attached to the machine. The washing time 
varies with type of fabric and amount of soiling. Washing machines can 
be manual, semi-automatic and fully automatic.

Finishing 

After washing it is very important to rinse the article in clean water till it is 
absolutely free of soap or detergent. Very often in the last rinse some other 
reagents are added which can help to restore the freshness or brightness 
of the fabric. Other reagents may add to the body of the fabric and improve 
its stiffness or crispness. 
(i)	 Blues and Optical Brighteners: You must have observed that 

with repeated use and washings white cotton articles tend to loose 209
their whiteness and become yellow in colour. In case of synthetic or 
manufactured fabrics and their blends the discolouration is more 
towards gray. 

	 	 The use of blues is recommended to counteract yellowness and 
to restore the whiteness. They cannot remedy the grayness. Blue 
is available in the market as ultramarine blue (in the form of a fine 
powdered pigment) and as liquid chemical dye.  Right amount of blueing 
should be used in the last rinse. The powder blue is pasted with a little 
amount of water and then added to more water. This solution is used 
immediately, as on standing this powder tends to settle at the bottom 
and would give patchy results. Liquid blues are easier to use and give 
more even results. Care should be taken to see that blue is applied to 
the fabric in a thoroughly wet (but not dripping) condition, which is 
free of folds of wringing. Move the article in the blue solution for a short 
duration, remove the excess moisture and place it for drying. 

	 	 Optical Brightening Agents or Fluorescent brightening agents are 
compounds with low grade or weak dyes that possess the property of 
fluorescence. These compounds can absorb light at a shorter wavelength 
and re-emit them at a longer wavelength. Treating a fabric with an 
optical fluorescent brightener can give it an intense bright whiteness, 
which can counteract both yellowness and grayness. They can also be 
used on coloured printed fabrics. Optical brighteners are sometimes 
referred to as whiteners. However, they cannot destroy a colour and

therefore should not be confused with bleaching. 
(ii)	Starches and stiffening agents: Repeated launderings cause loss to 

body of the fabric, which also looses its gloss and shine. Starching or 
use of stiffening agents is the most common technique to make the 
fabric firm, smooth and shiny. This finish not only enhances appearance 
and texture, but also prevents direct contact of dirt with the fabric.  
Starching also makes the subsequent washing easier as dirt clings to 
starch rather than to the fabric. 
Stiffening agents are derived from nature, either plants or animals. 

The most common stiffening agents are starch, gum acacia, borax and 
gelatin. 

(a) Starch is obtained from wheat (maida), rice, arrow-root, tapioca, 
etc. They are available powder form in the market and have to be 
cooked before use. Consistency of starch depends on the thickness 
of the fabric to be starched. As a stiffening agent it is used only 
for cotton and linen. Thick cottons need light starching while thin 
fabrics need heavy starching. Commercially prepared starches 
available in the market are easy to use and do not necessarily 
require hot water for preparation.

(b) Gum Acacia or Gum Arabic is the natural gum obtained from the 
210 Acacia plant (babool tree) which is available in granulated lumps. 

The stiffening solution is prepared by soaking it overnight to dissolve 
it and then sieving it to get a lump free solution. This gives only light 
stiffening, which is more in the nature of crispness. It is used for 
silks, very fine cottons, rayons and silk and cotton blends.  

(c) Gelatin is easy to make and use but is expensive compared to 
other homemade starches. 

(d) Borax is not really a starch but the addition of a small quantity in 
the starch solution helps to improve its stiffening action. When the 
fabric is ironed after starching, borax melts and forms a thin film 
on the surface of the fabric. This is water repellent in nature and 
thus maintains the crispness even in humid climates.

	 	 Application of stiffening agent depends on the fibre content and the 
specific use of the article. For personal clothing it is often the user’s 
choice as well. Care has to be taken when applying the starch solution 
that the correct consistency of the starch is taken and the fabric is in a 
thoroughly wet (but not dripping) condition. The fabric is kneaded well 
in the solution, excess squeezed out and dried. When starching dark 
coloured cottons a small amount of blue or tea concoction can be added 
to the starch solution so that it does not show up as white patches.

(e) Drying:  After the clothes have been washed, blued and starched, they 
have to be dried, before they can be ironed or stored. The best way of 
drying is to hang the fabrics outside in the sun with the wrong side facing

Care and Maintenance of Fabrics

out. Sun not only dries the clothes faster but also acts as an antiseptic, 
and also as a bleaching agent for white fabrics. Delicate fabrics like 
silk and woolens cannot be hung for too long in the sun, as strong 
sunlight damages these fabrics. Synthetic fibres lose their strength 
when exposed to sunlight. These fabrics also tend to turn yellow, which 
is irreversible.  So, it is best to dry these fabrics indoors. 

Ironing

After you have washed your articles, you would notice that these articles 
have wrinkles and undesired creases on them. Ironing helps to get rid 
of these and creates creases where desired. Good ironing requires three 
things high temperature, moisture, and pressure.

An iron can provide high temperature. It can be a charcoal iron or an 
electric iron. The charcoal iron though cheap has certain disadvantages. 
The coal that is used to produce heat may stain the article being ironed and 
most important is that the temperature cannot be controlled in this type of 
iron.  Different fibre groups have different thermal properties. Due to this 
they need to be ironed at their specific temperatures. This can be achieved 
by using an electric iron, where the temperature can be controlled. Thus, 
if electricity is not a problem, then an automatic electric iron is the best 211
option.

The second requirement for ironing is moisture. Moisture would be 
automatically provided if you start ironing your clothes when they are 
damp after washing. If your articles are completely dry, then you can 
sprinkle some water on them and roll them in towel, so that moisture 
penetrates evenly throughout the article. Water can also be sprayed with 
a normal spraying bottle. 

The third requirement for good ironing is pressure. This is provided 
manually by the movement of the iron over the article to be ironed. Iron is 
generally moved on the clothes along the length. The articles, which may 
stretch or loose their shape by the movement of iron, for example, laces 
should be pressed and not ironed. Pressing involves keeping the hot iron 
at one place on the cloth, then lifting it and then keeping it at another 
place on the cloth. Pressing can also be used for setting of any folds like 
creases, hems, pockets, plackets and pleats.

The table that one uses for ironing should be rightly padded, and yet 
firm. The top should have an even surface and should be of such size and 
height that it is comfortable for the worker. These days padded ironing 
boards are available in market. If these are not available, then on any 
leveled surface 3-4 layers of some thick fabric can be spread and used as 
a surface for ironing.

After ironing the articles are either given specific folds or are placed on

hangers depending upon the storage space available. It is important that 
they are available in the finished state when required for use.

Dry-cleaning

Dry-cleaning can be defined as the cleaning of fabrics in a non-aqueous 
liquid medium. The important difference between dry and wet solvents 
is that while water is absorbed by the fibres, which causes shrinkage, 
wrinkle formation and colour bleeding; the dry solvents do not cause fibre 
swelling. Hence dry-cleaning is a safe method for cleaning delicate textiles. 
For dry-cleaning, the most common solvents used are perchloro-ethylene, 
a petroleum solvent, or a fluorocarbon solvent. 

Dry-cleaning is generally done in industrial establishments and not at 
the domestic level. The items are brought to the cleaner’s and identified with 
a tag that includes special instructions. Items are first inspected and treated 
at a spot board. Because a solvent is used, stains that are water-soluble and 
other hard-to-remove spots must be treated on the spot board. Customers 
who identify the stains for the dry cleaner make the cleaning task easier and 
ultimately improve their satisfaction with the cleaned product.

Additional treatment that many dry cleaners are equipped to do include 
212 replacing buttons, doing minor repairs to items, replacing sizing, water 

repellency and other finishes like permanent creases,  moth proofing and 
cleaning fur and leather. Some dry cleaners also clean and sanitise feather 
pillows, blankets, quilts and carpets, and clean and press draperies.

17.4	Storage of Textile Products
The weather is not the same all the year round in our country; hence we 
have clothing to match all temperatures. The need for specific fabrics for 
specific weather conditions necessitates the storage of those not needed at 
the particular time. Whatever be the clothes, they need to be clean and dry 
before they are packed and stored away. Woolens should be brushed well 
and dry cleaned before they are stored, all stains should be removed and 
all tears mended. Pockets are to be turned inside out, trousers and sleeves 
turned up; they must be examined and freed from dust, grit, soot, etc. 
All clothing should be shaken, brushed, washed, ironed and folded. Pack 
loosely in cupboards or trunks. Too compact and tight packing may result 
in permanent creases sets at the folds of the fabrics. The shelves, boxes or 
closets chosen for storing should be clean, dry and insect free, away from 
dust and dirt.  It is important that the packing should be in an atmosphere 
of very low humidity. Different fabrics require different care while storage, 
as each is susceptible to different micro organisms.

Care and Maintenance of Fabrics

11.5	Factors Affecting Fabric Care
The selection, use, and care of fabrics depend on many factors. Fibre 
content, yarn structure, fabric construction, colour application and 
finishing are the important factors considered for the product.

Each type of fabric has its own individual characteristics and hence 
needs specific care.

Fibres of which fabrics are made influence their care requirements, 
as shown in Table 2.

Human Ecology and Family Sciences

Yarn structure

Yarn structure (twist or type of yarn) may affect maintenance. For example 
yarns with high twist would shrink or novelty and complex yarns may 
catch or snag or get abraded. Blended yarns would mean that both fibre 
contents would have to be taken care of. You cannot use very hot water 
when polyester is blended with cotton since it would shrink, however it 
would not wrinkle much and therefore easier to iron.  

Fabric construction

Fabric construction is closely related to maintenance. Simple closely woven 
fabrics are easy to maintain. Fancy weaves — satin, pile, or those with 
long floats may snag during washing. Knitted fabrics stretch out of shape 
and may thus require re-blocking. Sheer fabrics, laces and nets as also 
felts and non-wovens have to be handled carefully.

Colour and finishes 
216

Colour is an important aspect of care. Dyed and printed fabrics may lose 
colour during cleaning and may stain other materials. The colour of the 
fabric may be tested before use and proper care needs to be taken in its 
use. 

Many of the finishing treatments alter the behaviour of the fabrics, 
which may improve or cause problems. Some of the finishes may require 
renewal after every wash.

Thus, we can conclude that fibre content, yarn structure, fabric 
construction, colour application and finishing are the important factors 
considered for all fabric products. They combine to determine the 
appearance, comfort, durability and maintenance requirements. The 
importance of appearance, comfort, durability and maintenance are 
relative. It becomes our responsibility to evaluate the qualities of a fabric 
in terms of its ultimate end-use and then make the decisions concerning 
its use and care. 

11.6 Care Label 
The care label is a permanent label or tag containing regular care information 
and instructions that are attached or affixed in such a manner that it will 
not separate from the product and will remain legible during the useful life 
of the garment.
