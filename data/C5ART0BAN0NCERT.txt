Foreword

The Foundational Stage in school education, as envisaged by the 
National Education Policy 2020, serves as the cornerstone for the 
holistic development of children. It enables them not only to imbibe the 
invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos and constitutional 
framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. This 
foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into the more 
challenging Preparatory Stage.

The Preparatory Stage acts as a bridge between the Foundational 
and the Middle Stages, spanning three years from Grade 3 to Grade 5. 
The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical 
approaches of the Foundational Stage. While the play-way, discovery, 
and activity-based learning methods continue, children are also 
introduced to textbooks and more formal classroom settings. This 
introduction aims not to overwhelm, but to establish a foundation 
across curricular areas, promoting holistic learning and self-exploration 
through reading, writing, speaking, drawing, singing, and playing. 
This comprehensive approach encompasses physical education, art 
education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic 
science, and social science. This comprehensive approach ensures that 
children are well-prepared at both the cognitive-sensitive and physical-
pranic (emotional) levels to effortlessly transition to the Middle Stage.

The textbook, Bansuri, Grade 5, is meticulously designed to align 
with these objectives. It adheres to the recommendations of the National 
Education Policy 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework 
for School Education 2023. The textbook emphasises conceptual 

0_Prelims.indd   3 30-Jun-25   11:43:35 AM

understanding, critical thinking, creativity, values and dispositions 
essential for this developmental stage. 

It incorporates cross-cutting themes, such as inclusion, 
multilingualism, gender equality, and cultural rootedness integrating 
appropriate ICT and school-based assessments. The engaging content 
and activities are designed to captivate students and encourage peer 
group learning, thus enriching the educational experience for students 
as well as teachers.

It is crucial to remember the pedagogical focus of the textbook 
emphasising understanding, critical thinking, reasoning, and decision 
making. Children’s innate curiosity at this stage should be nurtured 
by addressing their questions and designing activities based on core 
learning principles. While the play-way method continues, the nature of 
toys and games used for teaching evolves to enhance engagement rather 
than mere attraction.

While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore additional 
resources on the subject. School libraries should facilitate this extended 
learning, and parents and teachers should support their endeavours.

An effective learning environment motivates students, keeping them 
engaged and fostering curiosity and wonder vital for learning.

With confidence, I recommend this textbook to all students and 
teachers at the Preparatory Stage. I extend my gratitude to everyone 
involved in its development, hopeful that it will meet expectations.

As the NCERT remains committed to systemic reforms and improving 
publication quality, we welcome feedback to refine the textbook content.

About the Book

This book has been developed based on the recent 
documents, the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 
and the National Curriculum Framework for School 
Education (NCF-SE) 2023. These documents aim to 
ensure that all children achieve the Curricular Goals 
(CGs) and the competencies appropriate to this age 
and stage. A syllabus has been developed based on the 
CGs, competencies, as well as the learning outcomes. 
	 The NCF-SE has recommended Arts as one of the 
compulsory curricular subjects up to Grade 10 and 
also recommends that the schools give 100 hours per 
academic session to Arts, which has the following four 
components or areas — Music, Theatre, Dance, and Visual 
Arts. Thus, the textbook Bansuri has been divided into 
four units comprising chapters in each unit. There are 
many activities in every chapter that children in this grade 
can easily do with your intervention. 
 	 The overall spirit of the textbook encourages working 
together in groups; communicating ideas, emotions, 
and feelings; embracing the artistic journey of all fellow 
students; working in an inclusive environment; and 
becoming conscious of and rooted in your national heritage.

How to Use this Textbook (Bansuri )
The textbook is divided into four units and every unit has a different 
colour as in the previous textbooks, so most students are used to the 
colours used for each section by now:
Yellow for Visual Arts
Purple for Theatre 
Blue for Music 
Pink for Dance 

The four art forms each have a Unit dedicated to them. Even though 
they are unique in their own ways, they have very interesting similarities, 
just like all children. Each unit begins with an introduction about the art 

form that the learner will experience. There are plenty of hints for 
you to organise activities and look for resources, especially 

resources embedded in the QR code of each chapter. 
In case you do not have access to the internet, you 

can either take the children to or invite local artists, folk 
musicians, dancers, and other performers to the school 
for interaction. Many parents and other community 
members, who are skilled in an art form, may agree 
to perform for the children. Interactive sessions with 
artists and performers may be organised frequently 

in the school, where children may be encouraged 
to ask questions. This should be inspirational for 
the children. You need to take the children out of 

0_Prelims.indd   7 30-Jun-25   11:43:37 AM

the classroom, in and out of the school to look around, to observe 
nature and day-to-day activities around them. Organising field 
trips to watch plays, dance performances, music concerts and art 
exhibitions would help in motivating children. There are a number 
of activities that have been suggested; you can create more such 
activities and also contextualise them in terms of content, locally 
available materials, and other resources.

The timetable is to be designed in such a way that children get the 
opportunity to have specified periods for all four art forms allocated 
every week. Wherever possible, a block period or two combined 
periods can be kept for children to do the activities, since all the 
activities are quite engaging and enjoyable. 

Like Grade 4, during the first few minutes of every art class, 
children can sit with their eyes closed and remember what they 
have done in the previous class. Before starting their activities, 
they can recite the following verse from Abhinaya Darpana by 
Nandikeshwara, based on Natya Shastra, an ancient Indian treatise 
on performing arts:

Aangikam bhuvanam yasya
Vaachikam sarva vaangmayam

Aaharyam chandra taaraadi
tam vande saatvikam Shivam

Meaning 
Where the body is the universe, speech is the essence of all sound, 
ornamentation is the moon and the stars, I bow down to that 
supreme divinity.

0_Prelims.indd   8 30-Jun-25   11:43:37 AM



The last 10 minutes may be kept for discussion as ‘circle 
time’. As suggested in the Theatre section, all children, along 
with the teacher, sit together and express freely. But this time 
is informal, only for the children. The teachers are required to 
take notes for themselves, which can be applied in their next 
lesson plans.

The assessment tools have also been suggested to mark 
the progress of the level of competency and skill development 
in a child. In Arts, there is no pass or fail; nothing is good or 
bad at this stage, there is always a scope of improvement and 
children should be encouraged to complete the activities with an 
understanding of the concepts; rather than being discouraged, 
they need to be motivated and hopefully they will respond. Every 
child is different from the other, so are their skills, expressions 
and this diversity is the beauty of their childhood. They or 
their performance should not be compared with anyone in the 
classroom; instead, their progression needs to be assessed. They 
should compete with themselves for improvement. 
What Do You Need for an Arts Class?
For all art activities, you need a well-lit space that may be in or 
out of the classroom, where children can move around freely. 
You will need very simple materials for props for theatre; art 
material like tools and basic stationery; space for safely storing 
material, as well as students’ artwork in an organised manner; 
display boards for showcasing and sharing works of children; 
computer, projector, speaker to play audio-video resources;

0_Prelims.indd   9 30-Jun-25   11:43:37 AM

simple musical instruments; etc. Make sure that the materials 
and resources are well-utilised and are locally available. 

We hope that all of you—children, teachers, and wards—will 
find this textbook to be useful, interesting, and resourceful, 
making every art class exciting and something to look forward 
to. We are open to feedback that would help in improving the 
structure and content of the book. It is a constant effort to make 
the visual arts and performing arts an integral part of every 
child’s growing up years—developing skills in them to become 
confident, emotionally strong, and balanced citizens of tomorrow.

Time Allocation and Assessments

This Arts Education textbook contains four sections, each focusing on a separate 
art form. It is important to plan the timetable in a way that distributes the learning 
of all art forms equally throughout the year.

As per the NCF-SE 2023, the time allocated for Arts Education for the entire 
academic year is 100 hours (or 150 periods of 40 minutes each). This book has 
been written with this time allocation in mind. 

It is preferable to have all four art forms distributed across the week so that 
progress in all sections happens simultaneously. It is better to avoid a system 
where one art form is taken up only after the full completion of another.

Experiential Work

Time in hours 20 20 20 20 20

No. of 40 minute

The Timetable
Under the Illustrative timetable of the NCF-SE 2023, arts education has been 
allocated four periods during the week and one period on Saturday. The document 
also suggests the use of block periods, where two 40-minute periods are combined 
to make enough time for activity-based classes. This would give a continuous 
stretch of 80 minutes (1 hour 20 minutes). Based on these options, the four art 
forms could be allocated the four periods on weekdays, while Saturday could 

0_Prelims.indd   16 30-Jun-25   11:43:41 AM



be used for interdisciplinary activities or art-based field trips, such as concerts, 
performances, or visits to art galleries.

While the first plan with 40-minute periods will have classes for all four art forms 
every week, the second plan will have only two art forms per week. Every individual 
art form would have classes every alternative week. It is important to ensure that all 
art forms progress simultaneously, as this would enable the children to understand 
the inter-connections between them, leading to a more holistic understanding.

Assessment
Assessments in Arts Education play a crucial role in understanding and 
nurturing students’ creative abilities and artistic growth. Unlike other subjects, 
arts education assessments focus on evaluating a wide range of skills, including 
creativity, critical thinking, technical proficiency, and expressive capabilities. 
These assessments are designed not only to measure progress and mastery but 
also to encourage exploration, self-expression, and a deeper appreciation for the 
arts.
Methods of Assessments
Since assessment processes in arts education are primarily skill-based, they 
do not rely on the ‘correct’ or ‘wrong’ answer from the child. Therefore, it is 
important not to structure ‘tests’ with question papers and written answers as 
this would entirely defeat the purpose of the approach used in the arts education 
curriculum. A variety of assessment methods, such as portfolios, performance 
reviews, project-based evaluations, and reflective self-assessments, can provide 
valuable insights into each student’s unique artistic journey.
Formative and Summative Assessments
●	 Formative assessment is based on observations in every class and the child’s 

performance in each activity. Rubrics provided at the end of each chapter help 
structure the scores or grades throughout the year.

●	 Summative assessment requires a separate day allotted for assessment. Activities 
conducted in class throughout the year and its variations can be used to assess 
the child’s understanding and ability in different skills and competencies. 
Examples are provided at the end of each section to enable better planning. 
Students are to create spontaneously, based on the given task. 

0_Prelims.indd   18 30-Jun-25   11:43:41 AM



Grades and Scores
Since art centred on creativity, visualisation, expression, and imagination, it does 
not have correct or wrong answers. Therefore, scoring is based on parameters, 
such as the level of skill acquired and the competencies demonstrated by the child. 
The teachers must be completely familiar with the competencies and learning 
outcomes for each activity, to ensure a fair assessment. 

A five-point scale is recommended for marking under criterion. This would 
enable teachers, parents, and students clearly understand the child’s progress. 
The table below can be used as a reference to mark the five-point scale in the 
rubrics provided after each chapter. 

It is essential to combine both quantitative assessment (scores or grades based 
on rubrics) and qualitative assessment (teacher’s observations on the child’s 
behaviour, interest, progress, and other aspects that may not be mentioned in 
the rubrics).

Learning Level of Student Numerical Scale Grades

Beginning 1 E

Developing 2 D

Promising 3 C

Proficient 4 B
Excellent 5 A

Assessment criteria are based on Curricular Goals (CG) and Competencies (C) from the NCF-SE 2023.

Dear Children,
Imagine stepping into a world where colours dance, music 
tells stories, and you get to create characters, pictures, and 
movement! That’s exactly what you will experience in this 
book. It all has a lot of fun. 

As you proceed with the textbook, you will discover that 
all art forms are connected. You will see how visual arts, 
theatre, music, and dance are connected with each other. A 
painting can tell a story without words, just like a play can 
bring emotions to life. A tune can make us want to move, just 
as a dance can show feelings that words cannot express. Art 
is all around us, and through this book, you will learn how to 
see, hear, feel, and express in a whole new way. 

Each chapter will guide you through exciting activities. You 
might paint a scene from the story, act out a funny moment 
with your friends, create your own rhythms inspired by the 
characters, or use movement to show different emotions. You 
will also get a chance to work together, just like the animals 
in our Panchatantra story, and discover how teamwork makes 
art even more powerful.

But this journey is not just about learning new skills. It’s 
about finding your own voice. Whether you love drawing, 
acting, singing, or dancing, this book will help you express 

0_Prelims.indd   21 30-Jun-25   11:43:42 AM



xxii

yourself in ways you never imagined. There’s no right or 
wrong in art—only the joy of creating and sharing.

So, get ready to explore, experiment, and express! By the 
time you reach the last page, you won’t just have read a story, 
you will have lived it through art. Let’s begin this magical 
adventure together!

OBJECTS ON THE MOVE

Have you ever taken a ride on a giant wheel 
at a fair? 

	 The wheel is one of the most important inventions of 
humankind. It was invented more than 5000 years ago 
as a potter’s wheel. After that, it was used in carts and 
chariots to transport people and goods.
	 Think of the various objects and places where you 
see wheels. Can you imagine a life without wheels?
	 This chapter helps you explore the world of 
transport, where things are constantly on the 
move— with a few bumps and halts along the way. 
Through many exciting activities, you will observe 
vehicles and make artworks that give them new 
shapes, forms, colours, and functions.

ACTIVITY 1.2   Creating Patterns from Parts

Have you ever visited an automobile 
workshop? The mechanics there remove 
and repair different parts of bikes, cars, 
and other vehicles. 
	 Just like vehicles have different parts, 
pictures and artworks also have parts. 
These parts are called visual elements.

Identify the parts of a bicycle and visual 
elements used in the picture given.
On a separate sheet of paper, create your 
pattern using any two or three vehicle 
parts. It could be a seat, a bell, a pedal, 
a mirror,  a handlebar, a steering wheel, 
or any other part of any vehicle. Make it 
interesting with colours.

SPREADING THE MESSAGE

	 A well-designed poster can positively 
influence a person’s thoughts and behaviour.

School events are a lot of fun, but they 
also involve a lot of preparation and 	 This chapter introduces you to some 
organisation. We want many people to basic design principles that will help

to share event details. 
	 A poster or invitation card should not 
only look attractive but also make the 
information easy to remember. 
	 Posters can also be used to remind 
people about important topics, such as 
road safety, personal safety, cleanliness, 
nutrition and hygiene, good habits, school 
rules, and so on.

	 Identify the common elements used in 
the different posters.

	What helps you easily get the main 
message on each poster? 

	What is the first thing that catches your 
attention in each poster? Why do you 
see it first?

Posters carry messages that inform and 
create awareness. They use a mix of 
visuals and words to catch our attention 
and communicate important messages 
quickly and effectively. 

Part-1 Chapter 5.indd   42 27-Jun-25   3:51:34 PM



Posters convey information effectively in 
just a few words. The arrangement of text 
and images in a poster is based on design 
principles. These principles help us make 
effective designing decisions.
	 Emphasis is a design principle that 
gives importance to one part more than 
others. It helps the viewer focus on the 
main message the visual and text convey.
	 Identify the visual or text in the poster 

that is emphasised. 
	How has it been emphasised?

It is very important that you remember these do’s and dont’s every time 
you are on stage, for any performance that you do in the future. These 
comprise what is called ‘stage etiquette’. These are basic behavioural 
rules that create a pleasant experience for the actors and the audience.

story. Later, you may tell me what you

	 Once, in Class 5B, a group of students decided to 
put up a grand play called The Jungle Adventure. It 
had everything—talking trees, dancing monkeys and a 
detective squirrel. They were all very excited. So excited 
that everyone wanted a role on stage.
	 “I’ll be the lion!”, said Aditya. “I’ll be the river!”, shouted 
Meera, practising her watery dance. “I’ll be the narrator 
and also the parrot, and maybe the waterfall!”, added Nisha, 
clearly trying to break some kind of world record. After a 

week of fun rehearsals, they were ready, 
or so they thought. 

	 Three days before the big show, their 
teacher asked, “Who’s doing the lights, music and 

setting up the stage? What about your costumes?”.
	 There was a sudden silence.
	 They had forgotten all about backstage work!
	 “Who will play the music when the squirrel finds 
the treasure?”
	 “How can we change the jungle tree without 
anyone behind the curtain?”, someone whispered. 

Part-2 Chapter 8.indd   70 27-Jun-25   5:57:52 PM



They looked at each other. 
Everyone had an acting role. No 
one wanted to give it up.
	 After a long discussion and 
argument, they decided to ask 
Class 5A for help.
	 At first, 5A teased them a bit, 
“Oh! the ‘famous actors’ forgot they needed a team?”. But they 
agreed to help.

	 They learnt all the requirements and their timing. They 
became the real heroes of the show—pulling curtains, 
playing jungle sounds, managing props and even fixing 
the monkey tail that kept falling off. On show day, The 
Jungle Adventure was a hit! The crowd clapped, laughed, 
and cheered. But this time, everyone clapped for the 
backstage crew too.
	 From that day on, the actors of Class 5B never forgot:
“A play on stage shines only because of the stars 
behind the curtain.”

So what do we learn? Planning in all areas of work is important.

It is absolutely fine. In fact, even the 
professional actors who have been 
performing for many years, still get nervous 
before getting on stage. Psychology says, 
this nervousness sometimes helps actors 
perform better. So, all you have to do is 
to continue to work hard and make sure 
you know your lines and movements 
very well.

Note to Teacher: Some support and 
facilitation by the teacher will be required at 
the casting and scene blocking stages. Try 
encouraging the children to manage it on 
their own as much as possible. Intervention 
is recommended only when it is of utmost 
necessity.

SOUNDS AND INSTRUMENTS

Over the past few years, we have learnt 
about various musical instruments. 
Now, let us continue that journey.
	 Sitar, tabla, mridangam, tanpura … you may 
have seen, listened to or heard about some of these 
musical instruments, right? Musical instruments 
enable us to create and embellish music with 
various sounds, making a song or piece of music 
rich and layered. There are hundreds of musical 
instruments, from simple to highly complex. 
	 As we studied earlier, musical instruments 
are divided into four categories, namely: string 
(tata vadya), wind (sushira vadya), percussion 
(avanaddha vadya) and solid (ghana vadya).

which is played by striking a pair of 
mallets (called mizrab) on strings. The 
body of the instrument is made of maple 
or walnut wood. Santoor generally has 
100 strings. In ancient Sanskrit texts, the 
instrument is referred to as Shatatantri 
Veena. Hailing from Kashmir, santoor was 
used to accompany a form of music called 
Sufiyana Mausiqui, connected to the 
Sufi tradition. Santoor gained a place in 
the world of Hindustani classical music, 
due to the contributions of legendary 
santoor maestros like Pandit Shivkumar 
Sharma and Pandit Bhajan Sopori. This 
instrument creates a sense of peace and 
calmness, while also reminding us of the 
sounds of the Kashmir valley.

What is Tempo? Tempo is the change in 
speed of rhythm. The change in rhythm 
to faster or slower is called the change of 
tempo.

ACTIVITY 16.2  Dance with Tempo

Level 1: Try your everyday activities,  such 
as walking and walking quickly, while 
keeping a steady beat. Keep the beat by 
clapping. Walk around the classroom to 8 
(4+4) beats at a steady pace. Now, walk at 
double speed to the same 8 beats. Do you 
notice the difference? When you walk, the 
tempo is slow, but when you walk faster 
at double speed to the same beat count, 
the tempo is faster.
	 For example, compare the pace of 
your steps while walking versus walking 
quickly—both fit within 8 beats, but the 
movement speed changes with the tempo.
