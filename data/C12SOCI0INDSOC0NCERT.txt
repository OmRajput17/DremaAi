FOREWORD

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005, recommends that children’s life 
at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a 
departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system 
and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks 
developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They 
also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries 
between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly 
further in the direction of a child-centred  system of education outlined in the National 
Policy on Education (1986).

The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers 
will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative 
activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, 
children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them 
by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one 
of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating 
creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participates in 
learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. 
Flexibility in the daily time-tables is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual 
calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. 
The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this 
textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than 
a source of stress or problem. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem 
of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages 
with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. 
The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space 
to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and 
activities requiring hands-on experience.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates 
the hardwork done by the textbook development committee. We wish to thank the 
Chairperson of the advisory group in Social Sciences, Professor Hari Vasudevan, 
and the Chief Advisor for this textbook, Professor Yogendra Singh, for guiding the 
work of this committee. Several teachers also contributed to the development of 
this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are 
indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us 
to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE 
TEXTBOOKS

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students. 
The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load 
and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this 
background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks 
across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes 
have been taken into consideration in this exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:

 Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class

 Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject

 Difficulty level
 Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from 

teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning

 Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above.

HOW TO USE THIS TEXTBOOK

This is the first of the two textbooks for Class XII in Sociology. It is designed 
to address the spirit of the new guidelines issued by the National Curriculum 
Framework 2005, as well as the specific objectives of the Sociology curriculum adopted 
by the NCERT (Box 1). 

Box 1: oBjectives of the sociology curriculum, Ncert 2005 

 To enable learners to relate classroom teaching to their outside enviornment.
 To introduce them to the basic concepts of Sociology that will enable them to 

observe and interpret social life.
 To be aware of the complexity of social processes.
 To appreciate diversity in Indian society and the world at large.
 To build the capacity of students to understand and analyse the changes in 

contemporary Indian Society.

Indian Society builds on the two textbooks for Class XI, and complements the 
second textbook for Class XII — Social Change and Development in India. The specific 
correspondence of chapters and sections to the NCERT syllabus is indicated in Box 2. 
This is a suggested correspondence; teachers may also find other sections to be relevant 
or useful for particular segments of the syllabus.

Suggestions for Use

As already mentioned, this textbook is intended to reflect the spirit of the new National 
Curriculum Framework, where the emphasis has been on reducing the curricular 
burden on the child, specially in the form of information to be reproduced. Moreover, 
an effort has been made to relate the subject matter to the contemporary social 
environment and to the everyday life of the child. These features necessarily involve 
changes in the content and format of the textbook, and, of course, in the way that the 
classroom use of the textbook is to be structured. While each school, each teacher and 
each class will doubtless evolve their own ways of using this textbook, it is broadly 
true that the NCF will shift emphasis towards classroom discussion, activities and 
projects, and away from information-absorption and reproduction.

In addition to these general features of the NCF which will affect all subjects, 
there are some features specific to the content of this textbook which may require 
special handling. The obvious candidates are the chapters on caste and other forms of 
inequality, and those on minorities and related issues (Chs. 3, 5 and 6). Depending on 
the composition of the class, teachers will have to devise their own methods of dealing 
with sensitive material without making any section of students feel embarrassed. 
However, at the same time students from dominant sections of the society should also 
be challenged to question their common sense and to rethink many taken-for-granted 
issues and opinions. It is partly in view of these considerations that Ch. 3 is very light 
on activities, leaving it to the teacher to devise suitable ones for the specific class and 
the situation in which she/he is teaching.

Reprint 2025-26



Apart from this exception, however, the text tries to be activity based. Activities 
are inserted quite deliberately and are intended to be an integral part of the textbook. 
Teachers and students are welcome to modify them to suit local situations, but please 
do not skip them! There are different kind of activities. One kind which is new is called 
an ‘Exercise’. It is based on a specific text or table given in the text, and requires 
students to answer very specific questions. These should be taken as mandatory. 
Information boxes that are meant to provide contextual material that is not part of the 
evaluative content (i.e., students will not be examined on this material) are coloured 
(i.e., any colour other than shades of grey, which are the standard shades for boxes). 

In order not to overburden the text, we have not inserted too many references or 
citations. The references given at the end of each chapter are thus intended to be more 
of a bibliography rather than simply a list of citations. However, citations are given 
where specific information or quotations are involved. Teachers are of course welcome 
to use any additional readings or texts they find useful. There is a consolidated glossary 
at the end of the textbook, and students should be encouraged to refer to it. Terms 
explained in detail in the text are generally not included in the glossary. Many, but not 
all, of the words that are included in the glossary appear in bold when they are first 
used in the textbook. Remember, every word that appears in bold type will be found 
in the glossary, but the glossary includes many more words as well. 

A special word on projects and practical work. This feature is a new one, and 
involves a significant change in the evaluation procedure. Since at least twenty per 
cent of the total marks for sociology are to be devoted to this section, close attention 
should be paid to this. Chapter 7 provides some suggestions, along with a brief recap 
of the methods discussed in the Class XI textbook (Ch. 5 of Introducing Sociology). In 
view of the scheduling of project work, Chapter 7 is perhaps best discussed relatively 
early in the course (rather than at the end of all the other chapters), preferably after 
Chapter 2 and 3 have been discussed. The class can revisit Chapter 7 at the end of the 
textbook, but selection of projects and work on them should start much earlier. The 
project suggestions are merely indicative; please feel free to devise your own, keeping 
in mind the constraints and methodological considerations mentioned in Chapter 7.

This is NCERT’s first attempt to take on board the concerns of the new NCF for 
Class XII. We are already aware of some ways in which this textbook could be further 
improved, and we are also confident that during the coming year, teachers and 
students will come up with many more suggestions and comments that will help us 
revise it. Please do write to us at the following postal address: The Head, Department 
of Education in the Social Sciences, NCERT, Shri Aurobindo Marg, New Delhi-110016. 
Or you can send email to: headdess@gmail.com. We look forward to your responses, 
and specially your critical comments, including suggestions for improvements in the 
layout and format. We promise to acknowledge all useful suggestions in the next 
edition of this textbook.

Ind ian Soc iety

In one important sense, Sociology is unlike any other subject that you may 
have studied.  It is a subject in which no one starts from zero – everyone 
already knows something about society. Other subjects are learnt because 
they are taught (at school, at home, or elsewhere); but much of our knowledge 
about society is acquired without explicit teaching.  Because it is such an 
integral part of the process of growing up, knowledge about society seems to 
be acquired “naturally” or “automatically”.  No child is expected to already 
know something about History, Geography, Psychology or Economics when 
they come to school.  But even a six year old already knows something about 
society and social relationships.  It is all the more true then, that, as young 
eighteen year old adults, you know a lot about the society you live in without 
ever having studied it.

This prior knowledge or familiarity with society is both an advantage and a 
disadvantage for sociology, the discipline that studies society.  The advantage 
is that students are generally not afraid of Sociology – they feel that it can’t be 
a very hard subject to learn.  The disadvantage is that this prior knowledge can 
be a problem – in order to learn Sociology, we need to “unlearn” what we already 
know about society.  In fact, the initial stage of learning Sociology consists 
mainly of such unlearning.  This is necessary because our prior knowledge 
about society – our common sense – is acquired from a particular viewpoint. 
This is the viewpoint of the social group and the social environment that we are 
socialised into.  Our social context shapes our opinions, beliefs and expectations 
about society and social relations.  These beliefs are not necessarily wrong, 
though they can be.  The problem is that they are ‘partial’.  The word partial 
is being used here in two different senses – incomplete (the opposite of whole), 
and biased (the opposite of impartial).  So our ‘unlearnt’ knowledge or common 
sense usually allows us to see only a part of social reality; moreover, it is liable 
to be tilted towards the viewpoints and interests of our own social group.

What may be of even more interest to you is that sociology can show you what 
you look like to others; it can teach you how to look at yourself ‘from the outside’, 
so to speak.  This is called ‘self-reflexivity’, or sometimes just reflexivity.  This 
is the ability to reflect upon yourself, to turn back your gaze (which is usually 
directed outward) back towards yourself.  But this self-inspection must be 
critical – i.e., it should be quick to criticise and slow to praise oneself.  

A comparable social map would tell you where you are located in society. 
For example, as a seventeen or eighteen year old, you belong to the social 
group called “young people”.  People your age or younger account for about 
forty per cent of India’s population.  You might belong to a particular regional 
or linguistic community, such as a Gujarati speaker from Gujarat or a Telugu 
speaker from Andhra Pradesh.  Depending on your parent’s occupation and 

2 your family income, you would also be a member of an economic class, such 
as lower middle class or upper class.  You could be a member of a particular 
religious community, a caste or tribe, or other such social group.  Each of 

Reprint 2025-26



Introduc ing Ind ian Soc iety

these identities would locate you on a social map, and among a web of social 
relationships.  Sociology tells you about what kinds of groups or groupings 
there are in society, what their relationships are to each other, and what this 
might mean in terms of your own life.

But sociology can do more than simply help to locate you or others in this 
simple sense of describing the places of different social groups.  As C.Wright 
Mills, a well-known American sociologist has written, sociology can help you to 
map the links and connections between “personal troubles” and “social issues”. 
By personal troubles Mills means the kinds of individual worries, problems or 
concerns that everyone has.  So, for example, you may be unhappy about the 
way elders in your family treat you or how your brothers, sisters or friends treat 
you.  You may be worried about your future and what sort of job you might 
get. Other aspects of your individual identity may be sources of pride, tension, 
confidence or embarrassment in different ways.  But all of these are about one 
person and derive meaning from this personalised perspective. A social issue, 
on the other hand, is about large groups and not about the individuals who 
make them up.  

This entire book is meant to introduce you to Indian society from a 
sociological rather than common sense point of view.  What can be said by way 
of an introduction to this introduction?  Perhaps it would be appropriate at this 
point to indicate in advance the larger processes that were at work in shaping 
Indian society, processes that you will encounter in detail in the pages to follow.

1.2 A Preview of this Book

In this, the first of two textbooks on sociology, you will be introduced to the 
basic structure of Indian society.  (The second textbook will be focussed on the 
specifics of social change and development in India.)

We begin with a discussion of the demographic structure of the Indian 
population (Chapter 2).  As you know, India is currently the second most 
populous country in the world, and in a few decades is projected to overtake 
China and become the most populous country in the world.  What are the ways 
in which sociologists and demographers study a population?  Which aspects of 
the population are socially significant, and what has been happening on these 
fronts in the Indian case?  Is our population simply an obstacle to development, 
or can it also be seen as helping development in some ways?  These are some 
of the questions that this chapter tries to tackle.  

In Chapter 3, we revisit the basic building blocks of Indian society in the 
form of the institutions of caste, tribe and family. As a unique feature of the 
Indian subcontinent, caste has always attracted a lot of scholarly attention. 
How has this institution been changing over the centuries, and what does 3
caste really mean today?  What is the context in which the concept of ‘tribe’ 

Reprint 2025-26



Ind ian Soc iety

was introduced into India? What sorts of communities are tribes supposed to 
be, and what is at stake in defining them as such? How do tribal communities 
define themselves in contemporary India?  Finally, the family as an institution 
has also been subjected to tremendous pressure in these times of rapid and 
intense social change. What changes do we see in the diverse forms of the family 
that exist in India?  By addressing questions like these, Chapter 3 builds the 
base for looking at further aspects of Indian society which would pre-suppose 
caste, tribe and family.

Chapter 4 explores the socio-cultural dimensions of the market as a powerful 
institution that has been the vehicle of change throughout world history. Given 
that the most sweeping and rapid economic changes were brought about first 
by colonialism and then by developmental policies, this chapter looks at how 
markets of different kinds have evolved in India, and the chain reactions they 
set in motion.  

Among the features of our society that have been the cause of greatest 
concern are its seemingly unlimited capacity for generating inequality and 
exclusion. Chapter 5 is devoted to this important subject. Chapter 5 looks at 
inequality and exclusion in the context of caste, tribe, gender and the ‘disabled’. 
Notorious as an instrument of division and injustice, the caste system has been 
the object of concerted attempts by the state and by the oppressed castes to 
reform or even abolish it.  What are the concrete problems and issues that this 
attempt faced?  How successful have movements to resist caste exclusion been 
in our recent past? What have been the special problems of tribal movements? 
In what context are tribal identities reasserting themselves today? Similar 
questions are dealt with in the context of gender relations, and the ‘disabled’. 
To what extent is our society responsive to the needs of the disabled? How 
much of an impact has the women’s movement had on the social institutions 
that have oppressed women?  

Chapter 6 deals with the difficult challenges posed by the immense diversity 
of Indian society.  This chapter invites us to step outside our normal, comfortable 
ways of thinking.  The familiar cliches and slogans about India being a land of 
unity in diversity have a hard and complex side to them.  Despite all the failures 
and inadequacies, India has not done too badly on this front. What have been 
our strengths and our weaknesses? How may young adults face issues like 
communal conflict, regional or linguistic chauvinism, and casteism without 
either wishing them away or being overwhelmed by them? Why is it important 
for our collective future as a nation that every minority in India not feel that 
it is insecure or at risk?

Finally, in Chapter 7, some suggestions are provided for you and your 
teachers to think about the practical component of your course.  This can be 
quite interesting and enjoyable, as you will discover.

Demography is the systematic study of population. The term is of Greek origin 
and is composed of the two words, demos (people) and graphein (describe), 
implying the description of people.  Demography studies the trends and 
processes associated with population including – changes in population size; 
patterns of births, deaths, and migration; and the structure and composition 
of the population, such as the relative proportions of women, men and different 
age groups. There are different varieties of demography, including formal 
demography which is a largely quantitative field, and social demography 
which focuses on the social, economic or political aspects of populations. All 
demographic studies are based on processes of counting or enumeration – such 
as the census or the survey – which involve the systematic collection of data 
on the people residing within a specified territory.

Demography is a field that is of special importance to sociology – in fact, 
the emergence of sociology and its successful establishment as an academic 
discipline owed a lot to demography.  Two different processes happened to 
take place at roughly the same time in Europe during the latter half of the 
eighteenth century – the formation of nation-states as the principal form of 
political organisation, and the beginnings of the modern science of statistics. 
The modern state had begun to expand its role and functions.  It had, for 
instance, begun to take an active interest in the development of early forms 
of public health management, policing and maintenance of law and order, 
economic policies relating to agriculture and industry, taxation and revenue 
generation and the governance of cities.  

This new and constantly expanding sphere of state activity required the 
systematic and regular collection of social statistics – or quantitative data on 
various aspects of the population and economy.  The practice of the collection 
of social statistics by the state is in itself much older, but it acquired its modern 
form towards the end of the eighteenth century.  The American census of 1790 
was probably the first modern census, and the practice was soon taken up in 
Europe as well in the early 1800s.  In India, censuses began to be conducted 
by the British Indian government between 1867–72, and regular ten yearly 
(or decennial) censuses have been conducted since 1881.  Independent India 
continued the practice, and seven decennial censuses have been conducted 
since 1951, the most recent being in 2011.  The Indian census is the largest 
such exercise in the world (since China, which has a slightly larger population, 
does not conduct regular censuses).

Demographic data are important for the planning and implementation of 
state policies, specially those for economic development and general public 
welfare.  But when they first emerged, social statistics also provided a strong 
justification for the new discipline of sociology. Aggregate statistics – or the 

6 numerical characteristics that refer to a large collectivity consisting of millions 
of people – offer a concrete and strong argument for the existence of social 
phenomena.  Even though country-level or state-level statistics like the number

of deaths per 1,000 population – or the death rate – are made up by aggregating 
(or adding up) individual deaths, the death rate itself is a social phenomenon 
and must be explained at the social level.  Emile Durkheim’s famous study 
explaining the variation in suicide rates across different countries was a good 
example of this. Durkheim argued that the rate of suicide (i.e., number of 
suicides per 100,000 population) had to be explained by social causes even 
though each particular instance of suicide may have involved reasons specific 
to that individual or her/his circumstances.  

Sometimes a distinction is made between formal demography and a broader 
field of population studies. Formal demography is primarily concerned with the 
measurement and analysis of the components of population change.  Its focus 
is on quantitative analysis for which it has a highly developed mathematical 
methodology suitable for forecasting population growth and changes in the 
composition of population.  Population studies or social demography, on the 
other hand, enquires into the wider causes and consequences of population 
structures and change.  Social demographers believe that social processes and 
structures regulate demographic processes; like sociologists, they seek to trace 
the social reasons that account for population trends.

2.1 Some TheorieS and ConCepTS in demography

The MalThusian Theory of PoPulaTion GrowTh

Among the most famous theories of demography is the one associated with the 
English political economist Thomas Robert Malthus (1766–1834).  Malthus’s 
theory of population growth – outlined in his Essay on Population (1798) – was 
a rather pessimistic one.  He argued that human populations tend to grow at 
a much faster rate than the rate at which the means of human subsistence 
(specially food, but also clothing and other agriculture-based products) can 
grow.  Therefore humanity is condemned to live in poverty forever because the 
growth of agricultural production will always be overtaken by population growth. 
While population rises in geometric progression (i.e., like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.), 
agricultural production can only grow in arithmetic progression  (i.e., like 2, 4, 
6, 8, 10, etc.). Because population growth always outstrips growth in production 
of subsistence resources, the only way to increase prosperity is by controlling 
the growth of population. Unfortunately, humanity has only a limited ability to 
voluntarily reduce the growth of its population (through ‘preventive checks’ 
such as postponing marriage or practicing sexual abstinence or celibacy). 
Malthus believed therefore that ‘positive checks’ to population growth – in the 
form of famines and diseases – were inevitable because they were nature’s way 

8 of dealing with the imbalance between food supply and increasing population. 

Malthus’s theory was influential for a long time.  But it was also challenged 
by theorists who claimed that economic growth could outstrip population

the rapid growth of population.  

Malthus was also criticised by liberal and Marxist 
scholars for asserting that poverty was caused by population 
growth.  The critics argued that problems like poverty and starvation were 
caused by the unequal distribution of economic resources rather than by 
population growth.  An unjust social system allowed a wealthy and privileged 
minority to live in luxury while the vast majority of the people were forced to 
live in poverty. 

The Theory of DeMoGraPhic TransiTion

Another significant theory in demography is the theory of demographic 
transition.  This suggests that population growth is linked to overall levels 
of economic development and that every society follows a typical pattern 
of development-related population growth.  There are three basic stages of 
population growth.  The first stage is that of low population growth in a 9
society that is underdeveloped and technologically backward.  Growth rates 
are low because both the death rate and the birth rate are very high, so that

the demographic transition is not yet complete as the 
mortality rate has been reduced but the birth rate has not been brought 
down to the same extent.  

COMMON CONCEPTS AND INDICATORS

Most demographic concepts are expressed as rates or ratios  they involve 
two numbers.  One of these numbers is the particular statistic that has been 
calculated for a speciÞc geographical-administrative unit; the other number 
provides a standard for comparison.  For example, the birth rate is the total 
number of live births in a particular area (an entire country, a state, a district 
or other territorial unit) during a speciÞed period (usually a year) divided by 
the total population of that area in thousands.  In other words, the birth rate 
is the number of live births per 1000 population. The death rate is a similar 
statistic, expressed as the number of deaths in a given area during a given 
time per 1000 population.  These statistics depend on the reporting of births 
and deaths by the families in which they occur.  

The rate of natural increase or the growth rate of population refers to the 
difference between the birth rate and the death rate.  When this difference is 
zero (or, in practice, very small) then we say that the population has stabilised, 

10 or has reached the replacement level, which is the rate of growth required 
for new generations to replace the older ones that are dying out.  Sometimes, 
societies can experience a negative growth rate, that is, their fertility levels are

and regions in the world today, such as Japan, Russia, Italy acTiviTy 2.2
and Eastern Europe.  

The fertility rate refers to the number of live births per Try to find out why the birth

The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths of babies or neighbourhood  about

in childbirth per 1,00,000 live births.  High rates of infant 
and maternal mortality are an unambiguous indicator of 
backwardness and poverty; development is accompanied by sharp falls in these 
rates as medical facilities and levels of education, awareness and prosperity 
increase.  One concept which is somewhat complicated is that of life expectancy. 
This refers to the estimated number of years that an average person is expected 
to survive.  It is calculated on the basis of data on age-specific death rates in 
a given area over a period of time.

The sex ratio refers to the number of females per 1000 males in a given area 
at a specified time period.  Historically, all over the world it has been found that 
there are slightly more females than males in most countries. This is despite 
the fact that, slightly more male babies are born than female ones; nature 
seems to produce roughly 943 to 952 female babies for every 1000 males. If 
despite this fact the sex ratio is somewhat in favour of females, this seems to 
be due to two reasons. First, girl babies appear to have an advantage over boy 
babies in terms of resistance to disease in infancy. At the other end of the life 
cycle, women have tended to outlive men in most societies, so that there are 
more older women than men.  The combination of these two factors leads to a 
sex ratio of roughly 1050 females per 1000 males in most contexts.  However, 
it has been found that the sex ratio has been declining in some countries like 
China, South Korea and specially India.  This phenomenon has been linked 
to prevailing social norms that tend to value males much more than females, 
which leads to ‘son preference’ and the relative neglect of girl babies.  

The age structure of the population refers to the proportion of persons in 
different age groups relative to the total population.  The age structure changes 
in response to changes in levels of development and the average life expectancy. 11
Initially, poor medical facilities, prevalence of disease and other factors make 
for a relatively short life span. Moreover, high infant and maternal mortality

rates also have an impact on the age structure.  With development, quality of 
life improves and with it the life expectancy also improves. This changes the 
age structure: relatively smaller proportions of the population are found in the 
younger age groups and larger proportions in the older age groups. This is also 
referred to as the ageing of the population.  

The dependency ratio is a measure comparing the portion of a population 
which is composed of dependents (i.e., elderly people who are too old to work, 
and children who are too young to work) with the portion that is in the working 
age group, generally defined as 15 to 64 years. The dependency ratio is equal 
to the population below 15 or above 64, divided by population in the 15-64 age 
group. This is usually expressed as a percentage. A rising dependency ratio 
is a cause for worry in countries that are facing an ageing population, since it 
becomes difficult for a relatively smaller proportion of working-age people to 
carry the burden of providing for a relatively larger proportion of dependents. 
On the other hand, a falling dependency ratio can be a source of economic 
growth and prosperity due to the larger proportion of workers relative to 
non-workers.  This is sometimes refered to as the ‘demographic dividend’, 
or benefit flowing from the changing age structure. However, this benefit is 
temporary because the larger pool of working age people will eventually turn 
into non-working old people.

2.2 Size and growTh of india’S populaTion

India is the second most populous country in the world after China, with a 
total population of 121 crores (or 1.21 billion) according to the Census of India 
2011.  As can be seen from Table 1, the growth rate of India’s population has 
not always been very high.  Between 1901–1951 the average annual growth 
rate did not exceed 1.33%, a modest rate of growth.  In fact between 1911 and 
1921 there was a negative rate of growth of – 0.03%. This was because of the 
influenza epidemic during 1918–19 which killed about 12.5 million persons 
or 5% of the total population of the country (Visaria and Visaria 2003: 191). 
The growth rate of population substantially increased after independence 
from British rule going up to 2.2% during 1961-1981. Since then although 
the annual growth rate has decreased it remains one of the highest in the 
developing world. Chart 1 shows the comparative movement of the crude birth 
and death rates. The impact of the demographic transition phase is clearly 
seen in the graph where they begin to diverge from each other after the decade 
of 1921 to 1931.  

Before 1931, both death rates and birth rates were high, whereas, after 
this transitional moment the death rates fell sharply but the birth rate only 
fell slightly.  

12
The principal reasons for the decline in the death rate after 1921 were 

increased levels of control over famines and epidemic diseases. The latter

cause was perhaps the most important. The major epidemic diseases in 
the past were fevers of various sorts, plague, smallpox and cholera. But the 
single biggest epidemic was the influenza epidemic of 1918-19, which killed 
as many as 170 lakh people, or about 5% of the total population of India at 
that time. (Estimates of deaths vary, and some are much higher. Also known 
as ‘Spanish Flu’, the influenza pandemic was a global phenomenon – see the 
box below.  A pandemic is an epidemic that affects a very wide geographical 
area – see the glossary). 

The Global Influenza Pandemic of 1918 –19 Box 2.2
Influenza is caused by a virus that attacks mainly the upper respiratory 
trac t – the nose, throat and bronchi and rarely a lso the lungs. The genetic  
makeup of influenza viruses allows for both major and minor genetic changes, 
making them immune to existing  vac c ines. Three times in the last c entury, the 
influenza viruses have undergone major genetic changes, resulting in global 
pandemic s and  la rge tolls in terms of both d isease and  deaths. The most infamous 
pandemic  was “ Spanish Flu”  whic h a ffec ted  la rge parts of the world  popula tion 
and  is thought to have killed  a t least 40 million peop le in 1918-1919. More rec ently, 
two other influenza pandemics occurred in 1957 (“Asian influenza”) and 1968 
(“Hong Kong influenza”) and caused significant morbidity and mortality globally. 
The global mortality rate from the 1918/1919 Spanish flu pandemic is not known, but 
is estimated at 2.5 – 5% of the human population, with 20% of the world population 
suffering from the disease to some extent. Influenza may have killed as many as 
25 million in its first 25 weeks; in contrast, AIDS killed 25 million in its first 25 years. 
Influenza spread across the world, killing more than 25 million in six months; some 
estima tes put the tota l killed  a t over twic e tha t number, possib ly even 100 million.
In the United States, about 28% of the population suffered, and 500,000 to 675,000 
died. In Britain 200,000 died; in France more than 400,000. Entire villages perished 
in Alaska  and  southern Afric a . In Austra lia  an estima ted  10,000 peop le d ied  
and in the Fiji Islands, 14% of the population died during only two weeks, and in 
Western Samoa 22%. An estimated 17 million died in India, about 5% of India’s 
population at the time. In the British Indian Army, almost 22% of troops who caught 
the d isease d ied  of it.

Improvements in medical cures for these diseases, programmes for mass 
vaccination, and efforts to improve sanitation helped to control epidemics. 
However, diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, diarrhoea and dysentery continue 
to kill people even today, although the numbers are nowhere as high as they 
used to be in the epidemics of the past.  Surat witnessed a small epidemic of 
plague in September 1994, while dengue and chikungunya epidemics are since 
reported in various parts of the country.  

Famines were also a major and recurring source of increased mortality. 
Famines were caused by high levels of continuing poverty and malnutrition 
in an agroclimatic environment that was very vulnerable to variations in 
rainfall.  Lack of adequate means of transportation and communication as 
well as inadequate efforts on the part of the state were some of the factors 
responsible for famines.  However, as scholars like Amartya Sen and 
others have shown, famines were not necessarily due to fall in foodgrains 
production; they were also caused by a ‘failure of entitlements’, or the 
inability of people to buy or otherwise obtain food.  Substantial improvements 
in the productivity of Indian agriculture (specially through the expansion 
of irrigation); improved means of communication; and more vigorous relief 
and preventive measures by the state have all helped to drastically reduce 
deaths from famine.  Nevertheless, starvation deaths are still reported from 
some backward regions of the country. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural 
Employment Guarantee Act is the latest state initiative to tackle the problem 
of hunger and starvation in rural areas.

Unlike the death rate, the birth rate has not registered a sharp fall.  This 
is because the birth rate is a sociocultural phenomenon that is relatively 
slow to change.  By and large, increased levels of prosperity exert a strong 
downward pull on the birth rate. Once infant mortality rates decline, and 
there is an overall  increase in the levels of education and awareness, family 
size begins to fall.  There are very wide variations in  fertility rates across the 
States of India, as can be seen in Chart 1 (on page no. 13). Some states, like 
Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal 
have managed to bring down their total fertility rates (TFR) to 1.7 each 
(2016). This means that the average woman in these states produces only 
1.7 children, which is below the ‘replacement level’ and Kerala’s TFR is also 
below the replacement level, which means that the population is going to 
decline in  future. But there are some states, notably Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, 
Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, which still have very high TFRs. In 2016, the 
TFRs of these states were 3.3, 2.8, 2.7 and 3.1, respectively. According to 
Sample Registration System, Statistical report 2020, India’s crude birth 
rate was 19.5. The rural birth rate was 21.1 and urban birth rate was 16.1. 
As per this statistics, Bihar with 25.5 and Uttar Pradesh with 25.1 account 
for the highest birth rate in India. Furthermore, as per economic survey 
2018-19, these two states will also account for almost half (50%) of the additions 15
to the Indian population up to the year 2041. Uttar Pradesh alone is expected to 
account for a little less than one-quarter (22%) of this increase. Chart 2 (on page

regional groupings of States.

2.3 Age Structure of the IndIAn PoPulAtIon

India has a very young population — that is, the majority of Indians tend to 
be young, and the average age is also less than that for most other countries. 
Table 2 shows that the share of the under 15 age group in the total population 
has come down from its highest level of 42% in 1971 to 29% in 2011.  The 
share of the 15–59 age group has increased slightly from 53% to 63%, while 
the share of the 60+ age group is very small but it has begun to increase 
(from 5% to 7%) over the same period.  But the age composition of the Indian 
population is expected to change significantly in the next two decades.  Most 
of this change will be at the two ends of the age spectrum – as Table 2 shows, 
the 0 -14 age group will reduce its share by about 11% (from 34% in 2001 to 
23% in 2026) while the 60 plus age group will increase its share by about 5%

The Age Group ‘pyramid’ shown in Chart 3 provides a much more 
deta iled  version of the kind  of age grouped  da ta  p resented  in Tab le 2. 
Here, data are shown separately for males (on the left side) and females 
(on the right side) with the relevant five-year age group in the middle. 
Looking at the horizontal bars (including both males and females in a 
particular age group) gives you a visual sense of the age structure of 
the popula tion. The age groups beg in from the 0-4 years group  a t the 
bottom of the pyramid  and  go on to the 80 years and  above age group  
a t the top .  There a re four d ifferent pyramids for the dec ennia l c ensus 
years of 1961, 1981, 2001 and the estimates for 2026.  The pyramid for 
2026 shows the estimated future size of the relevant age groups based 
on da ta  on the past ra tes of growth of eac h age group .  Suc h estimates 
are also called ‘projections’.
These pyramids show you the effec t of a  gradua l fa ll in the b irth ra te and  
rise in the life expec tanc y.  As more and  more peop le beg in to live to an 
older age, the top  of the pyramid  grows wider.  As rela tively fewer new 
b irths take p lac e, the bottom of the pyramid  grows narrower.  But the 
b irth ra te is slow to fa ll, so the bottom doesn’ t c hange muc h between 
1961 and 1981.  The middle of the pyramid grows wider and wider as 
its share of the tota l popula tion inc reases.  This c rea tes a  ‘ bulge’  in the 
middle age groups that is clearly visible in the pyramid for 2026.  This is 
what is refered to as the ‘demographic  d ividend ’  which will be d iscussed  
la ter in this c hap ter.
Study this c hart c a refully.  With the help  of your teac her, try to trac e 
what happens to the new-born generation of 1961 (the 0 – 4 age group) 
as it moves up  the pyramid  in suc c esive years.  
	Where will the 0 – 4 age group of 1961 be located in the pyramids 

for the la ter years?  
	Where – in whic h age group  – is the widest pa rt of the pyramid  as 

you move from 1961 to 2026?  
	What do you think the shape of the pyramid  might be in the year 

2051 and 3001?
As with fertility rates, there are wide regional variations in the age structure 

as well.  While a state like Kerala is beginning to acquire an age structure like 
that of the developed countries, Uttar Pradesh presents a very different picture 
with high proportions in the younger age groups and relatively low proportions 
among the aged.  India as a whole is somewhere in the middle, because it 
includes states like Uttar Pradesh as well as states that are more like Kerala. 
Chart 4 shows the estimated population pyramids for Uttar Pradesh and Kerala 21
in the year 2026.  Note the difference in the location of the widest parts of the 
pyramid for Kerala and Uttar Pradesh.

The Demographic  Struc ture of the Ind ian Soc iety

The bias towards younger age groups in the age structure is believed to 
be an advantage for India.  Like the East Asian economies in the past decade 
and like Ireland today, India is supposed to be beneÞ tting from a demographic 
dividend.  This dividend arises from the fact that the current generation of 
working-age people is a relatively large one, and it has only a relatively small 
preceding generation of old people to support.  But there is nothing automatic 
about this advantage  it needs to be consciously exploited through appropriate 
policies as is explained in Box 2.3 below.

Does the c hanging age struc ture offer a ‘demographic  BOX 2.3
dividend’ for India?
The demographic  advantage or ‘ d ividend ’  to be derived  from the 
age struc ture of the popula tion is due to the fac t tha t Ind ia  is (and  will rema in 
for some time) one of the youngest c ountries in the world .  A third  of Ind ia ’ s 
popula tion was below 15 years of age in 2011.  In 2020, the average Ind ian 
was only 29 years old , c ompared  with an average age of 37 in China  and  
the United  Sta tes, 45 in Western Europe, and  48 in Japan.  This imp lies a  la rge 
and  growing labour forc e, whic h c an deliver unexpec ted  benefi ts in terms of 
g rowth and  p rosperity. 
The ‘ demographic  d ividend ’  results from an inc rease in the p roportion of 
workers rela tive to non-workers in the popula tion.  In terms of age, the working 
popula tion is roughly tha t between 15 to 64 years of age.  This working age 
group  must support itself as well as those outside this age group  (i.e., c hild ren 
and  elderly peop le) who a re unab le to work and  a re therefore dependents.  
Changes in the age struc ture due to the demographic  transition lower the 
‘dependency ra tio’ , or the ra tio of non-working age to working-age popula tion, 
thus c rea ting  the potentia l for genera ting  growth.
But this potentia l c an be c onverted  into ac tua l g rowth only if the rise in the 
working age group  is ac c ompanied  by inc reasing levels of educ a tion and  
emp loyment.  If the new entrants to the labour forc e a re not educ a ted  then 
their produc tivity remains low.  If they remain unemployed, then they are unable 
to ea rn a t a ll and  bec ome dependents ra ther than earners.  Thus, c hang ing 
age struc ture by itself c annot guarantee any benefi ts unless it is p roperly utilised  
through p lanned development.  The rea l prob lem is in defi ning the dependency 
ra tio as the ra tio of the non-working age to working-age popula tion, ra ther 
than the ra tio of non-workers to workers. The d ifferenc e between the two is 
determined  by the extent of unemp loyment and  underemp loyment, whic h 
keep  a  part of the labour forc e out of p roduc tive work. This d ifferenc e exp la ins 
why some c ountries a re ab le to exp loit the demographic  advantage while 
others a re not. 
Ind ia  is indeed  fac ing a  window of opportunity c rea ted  by the demographic  
d ividend . The effec t of demographic  trends on the dependenc y ra tio defi ned  
in terms of age groups is quite visib le. The tota l dependenc y ra tio fell from 79 in 
1970 to 64 in 2005. But the p roc ess is likely to extend  well into this c entury with

c ontinued  fa ll in the p roportion of c hild ren and  then rise to 50 by 2050 bec ause

2.4 The deClining Sex-raTio in india 

The sex ratio is an important indicator of gender balance in the population.  As 
mentioned in the section on concepts earlier, historically, the sex ratio has been 
slightly in favour of females, that is, the number of females per 1000 males has 
generally been somewhat higher than 1000.  However, India has had a declining 
sex-ratio for more than a century, as is clear from Table 3.  From 972 females 
per 1000 males at the turn of the twentieth century, the sex ratio has declined to 
933 at the turn of the twenty-first century.  The trends of the last four decades 
have been particularly worrying – from 941 in 1961 the sex ratio had fallen to an 
all-time low of 927 in 1991 before posting a modest increase in 2001. According 
to Census of India 2011 sex ratio has increased and now it is 943 females per 
1000 males.

But what has really alarmed demographers, policy makers, social activists 
and concerned citizens is the drastic fall in the child sex ratio.  Age specific sex 
ratios began to be computed in 1961.  As is shown in Table 3, the sex ratio for the 
0 – 6 years age group (known as the juvenile or child sex ratio) has generally been 
substantially higher than the overall sex ratio for all age groups, but it has been 
falling very sharply.  In fact the decade 1991–2001 represents an anomaly in that 

24 the overall sex ratio has posted its highest ever increase of 6 points from the all time 
low of 927 to 933, but the child sex ratio has dropped from 945 to 927, a plunge 
of 18 points taking it below the overall sex ratio for the first time. In 2011 Census 
(provisional) the child sex ratio again decreased by 13 points and now it is 919.

The state-level child sex ratios offer even greater cause for worry.  As many 
as nine States and Union Territories have a child sex ratio of under 900 females 
per 1000 males. Haryana is the worst state with an incredibly low child sex 
ratio of 793 (the only state below 800), followed by Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, 
Delhi, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. As Map 2 shows, 
Uttar Pradesh, Daman & Diu, Himachal Pradesh, Lakhshadweep and Madya 
Pradesh are all under 925, while large states such as West Bengal, Assam, 
Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka are above the national average 
of 919 but below the 970-mark.  Even Kerala, the state with the better overall 
sex ratio does not do too well at 964, while the highest child sex ratio of 972 
is found in Arunachal Pradesh.

Demographers and sociologists have offered several reasons for the decline 
in the  sex ratio in India. The main health factor that affects women differently 
from men is childbearing. It is relevant to ask if the fall in the sex ratio may be 
partly due to the increased risk of death in childbirth that only women face. 
However, maternal mortality is supposed to decline with development, as levels 
of nutrition, general education and awareness, as well as, the availability of 
medical and communication facilities improves. Indeed, maternal mortality 

25
rates have been coming down in India even though they remain high by 
international standards.  So, it is difficult to see how maternal mortality could 
have been responsible for the worsening of the sex ratio over time. Combined

with the fact that the decline in the child sex ratio has been much steeper than 
the overall figure, social scientists believe that the cause has to be sought in 
the differential treatment of girl babies.

Several factors may be held responsible for the decline in the child sex ratio, 
including severe neglect of girl babies in infancy, leading to higher death rates; 
sex-specific abortions that prevent girl babies from being born; and female 
infanticide (or the killing of girl babies 
due to religious or cultural beliefs).  Each 
of these reasons point to a serious social 
problem, and there is some evidence that 
all of these have been at work in India. 
Practices of female infanticide have been 
known to exist in many regions, while 
increasing importance is being attached 
to modern medical techniques by which 
the sex of the baby can be determined in 
the very early stages of pregnancy.  The 
availability of the sonogram (an x-ray like 
diagnostic device based on ultra-sound 
technology), originally developed to identify 
genetic or other disorders in the foetus, are 
misused to identify and selectively abort 
female foetuses. 

The regional pattern of low child sex 
ratios seems to support this argument.  It 
is striking that the lowest child sex ratios 
are found in the most prosperous regions 
of India.  According to the Economic 
Survey for a recent year, Maharashtra, 
Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi 
are having high per capita income and 
the child sex ratio of these states is still 
low. So the problem of selective abortions 
is not due to poverty or ignorance or lack 

Women’s Agitation
of resources.  

Sometimes economically prosperous families decide to have fewer children 
– often only one or two now – they may also wish to choose the sex of their 
child.  This becomes possible with the availablity of ultra-sound technology, 
although the government has passed strict laws banning this practice and 
imposing heavy fines and imprisonment as punishment.  Known as the Pre-
natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, this 
law has been in force since 1996, and has been further strengthened in 2003. 
However, in the long run, the solution to problems, like bias against girl children, 
depends more on how social attitudes evolve, even though laws and rules can 
also help. Recently, the Government of India has introduced the programme, 
‘Beti-Bachao, Beti-Padhao’. It can prove to be an important policy to increase 27
the child sex ratio in the country.

2.5 liTeraCy

Literacy as a prerequisite to education is an instrument of empowerment. 
The more literate the population the greater the consciousness of career options, 
as well as participation in the knowledge economy.  Further, literacy can lead 
to health awareness and fuller participation in the cultural and economic 
well being of the community. Literacy levels have improved considerably after 
independence, and almost two-thirds of our population is now literate.  But 
improvements in the literacy rate have to struggle to keep up with the rate of 
growth of the Indian population, which is still quite high.  

Literacy varies considerably across gender, across regions, and across 
social groups.  As can be seen from Table 4, the literacy rate for women is 
16.3% less than the literacy rate for men.  However, female literacy has been 
rising faster than male literacy, partly because it started from relatively low 
levels.  Female literacy rose by about 10.4 per cent between 2001 and 2011 
compared to the rise in male literacy of 7.6 per cent in the same period. 
Literacy increased approximately 8% in total. Male literacy rose about 5% 
whereas female literacy rose about 10%. Again female literacy has been rising 
faster than male literacy. Literacy rates also vary by social group – historically 
disadvantaged communities like the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes 
have lower rates of literacy, and rates of female literacy within these groups 
are even lower.  Regional variations are still very wide, with states like Kerala 
approaching universal literacy, while states like Bihar are lagging far behind. 
The inequalities in the literacy rate are specially important because they 
tend to reproduce inequality across generations.  Illiterate parents are at a 
severe disadvantage in ensuring that their children are well educated, thus 
perpetuating existing inequalities.

2.6 RuRal-uRban DiffeRences

The vast majority of the population of India has always lived in the rural areas, 
and that continues to be true. According to Census of India 2011 still more 
people are living in rural areas but the population of urban areas has increased. 
Now 68.8% population lives in rural areas while 31.2% people live in urban 
areas. However, as Table 5 shows, the urban population has been increasing 
its share steadily, from about 11% at the beginning of the twentieth century 
to about 28% at the beginning of the twenty-first century, an increase of about 
two-and-a-half times.  It is not a question of numbers alone; processes of 
modern development ensure that the economic and social significance of the 
agrarian-rural way of life declines relative to the significance of the industrial-
urban way of life. This has been broadly true all over the world, and it is true in 
India as well.

Agriculture used to be by far the largest contributor to the country, but 
today it only contributes about one-sixth of the gross domestic product.  While 
the majority of our people live in the rural areas and make their living out 
of agriculture, the relative economic value of what they produce has fallen

drastically.  Moreover, more and more people who live in villages may no longer

migra tions? Considered from an urban point of view,  the rapid 
growth in urbanisation shows that the town or city has been 
acting as a magnet for the rural population.  Those who 

cannot find work (or sufficient work) in the rural areas go to the city in search 
of work.  This flow of rural-to-urban migration has also been accelerated by 
the continuous decline of common property resources like ponds, forests and 
grazing lands.  These common resources enabled poor people to survive in 
the villages although they owned little or no land.  Now, these resources have 
been turned into private property, or they are exhausted (Ponds may run dry 
or no longer provide enough fish; forests may have been cut down and have 
vanished…).  If people no longer have access to these resources, but on the 
other hand have to buy many things in the market that they used to get free 
(like fuel, fodder or supplementary food items), then their hardship increases. 
This hardship is worsened by the fact that opportunities for earning cash 
income are limited in the villages.

Sometimes the city may also be preferred for social reasons, specially the 
relative anonymity it offers.  The fact that urban life involves interaction with 
strangers can be an advantage for different reasons.  For the socially oppressed 
groups like the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, this may offer some 
partial protection from the daily humiliation they may suffer in the village where 
everyone knows their caste identity.  The anonymity of the city also allows the 
poorer sections of the socially dominant rural groups to engage in low status 
work that they would not be able to do in the village.  All these reasons make 
the city an attractive destination for the villagers.  The swelling cities bear 
testimony to this flow of population.  This is evident from the rapid rate of 
urbanisation in the post-Independence period.

While urbanisation has been occurring at a rapid pace, it is the biggest 
30

cities – the metropolises – that have been growing the fastest.  These metros 
attract migrants from the rural areas as well as from small towns.  There are

now 5,161 towns and cities in India, where 286 million people live.  What is 
striking, however, is that more than two-thirds of the urban population lives 
in 27 big cities with million-plus populations.  Clearly the larger cities in India 
are growing at such a rapid rate that the urban infrastructure can hardly keep 
pace.  With the mass media’s primary focus on these cities, the public face of 
India is becoming more and more urban rather than rural.  Yet in terms of the 
political power dynamics in the country, the rural areas remain a decisive force.

2.7 populaTion poliCy in india

It will be clear from the discussion in this chapter that population dynamics is 
an  important matter and that it crucially affects the developmental prospects 
of a nation as well as the health and well being of its people.  This is particularly 
true of developing countries who have to face special challenges in this regard. 
It is hardly surprising therefore that India has had an official population policy 
for more than a half century.  In fact, India was perhaps the first country to 
explicitly announce such a policy in 1952. 

The population policy took the concrete form of the National Family Planning 
Programme.  The broad objectives of this programme have remained the same – 
to try to influence the rate and pattern of population growth in socially desirable 
directions.  In the early days, the most important objective was to slow down 
the rate of population growth through the promotion of various birth control 
methods, improve public health standards, and increase public awareness

India ’s Demographic  Transition
Box 2.4

Census data from India (i.e., Registrar of India) suggests that population growth is 
on the dec line sinc e 1991. The average number of c hild ren a  woman expec ted  to 
give birth during her life was 3.8 in 1990, and this has fallen to 2.7 children per woman today 
(Bloom, 2011). Even though the fertility and population growth rates are declining, India’s 
population is projected to increase from 1.2 billion today to an estimated 1.6 billion by 2050 
due to  population momentum. Popula tion momentum refers to a  situa tion, where a  la rge

about population and health issues.  Over the past half-century or so, India 
has many significant achievements to her credit in the field of population, as 
summarised in Box 2.4.

The Family Planning Programme suffered a setback during the years of the 
National Emergency (1975 – 76). Normal parliamentary and legal procedures 
were suspended during this time and special laws and ordinances issued 
directly by the government (without being passed by Parliament) were in force. 
During this time the government tried to intensify the effort to bring down 
the growth rate of population by introducing a coercive programme of mass 
sterilisation. Here sterilisation refers to medical procedures like vasectomy (for 
men) and tubectomy (for women) which prevent conception and childbirth. 
Vast numbers of mostly poor and powerless people were forcibly sterilised and 
there was massive pressure on lower level government officials (like school 
teachers or office workers) to bring people for sterilisation in the camps that 
were organised for this purpose.  There was widespread popular opposition 
to this programme, and the new government elected after the Emergency 
abandoned it. Box 5

The National Family Planning Programme was renamed as the National 
Family Welfare Programme after the Emergency, and coercive methods were no 
longer used.  The programme now has a broad-based set of socio-demographic 
objectives. A new set of guidelines were formulated as part of the National 
Population Policy of the year 2000. In 2017, Government of India came out 
with National Health Policy 2017 in which most of these socio–demographic 
goals were incorporated with new targets (Box 2.5). Read these policy goals 
and discuss their implications in the class.

The history of India’s National Family Welfare Programme teaches us that 
while the state can do a lot to try and create the conditions for demographic 33
change, most demographic variables (specially those related to human fertility) 
are ultimately matters of economic, social and cultural change.

Having studied the structure and dynamics of the population of India in 
Chapter 2, we turn now to the study of social institutions. A population is 
not just a collection of separate, unrelated individuals, it is a society made up 
of distinct but interlinked classes and communities of various kinds. These 
communities are sustained and regulated by social institutions and social 
relationships. In this chapter we will be looking at three institutions that are 
central to Indian society, namely caste, tribe and family. 

3.1 Caste and the Caste system

Like any Indian, you already know that ‘caste’ is the name of an ancient social 
institution that has been part of Indian history and culture for thousands of 
years. But like any Indian living in the twenty-first century, you also know that 
something called ‘caste’ is definitely a part of Indian society today. To what 
extent are these two ‘castes’ – the one that is supposed to be part of India’s past, 
and the one that is part of its present – the same thing? This is the question 
that we will try to answer in this section.

Caste in the Past

Caste is an institution uniquely associated with the Indian sub-continent. 
While social arrangements producing similar effects have existed in other 
parts of the world, the exact form has not been found elsewhere. Although it 
is an institution characteristic of Hindu society, caste has spread to the major 
non-Hindu communities of the Indian sub-continent. This is specially true of 
Muslims, Christians and Sikhs. 

As is well-known, the English word ‘caste’ is actually a borrowing from the 
Portuguese casta, meaning pure breed. The word refers to a broad institutional 
arrangement that in Indian languages (beginning with the ancient Sanskrit) 
is referred to by two distinct terms, varna and jati. Varna, literally ‘colour’, 
is the name given to a four-fold division of society into brahmana, kshatriya, 
vaishya and shudra, though this excludes a significant section of the population 
composed of the ‘outcastes’, foreigners, slaves, conquered peoples and others, 
sometimes refered to as the panchamas or fifth category. Jati is a generic term 
referring to species or kinds of anything, ranging from inanimate objects to 
plants, animals and human beings. Jati is the word most commonly used to 
refer to the institution of caste in Indian languages, though it is interesting 
to note that, increasingly, Indian language speakers are beginning to use the 
English word ‘caste’. 

The precise relationship between varna and jati has been the subject of much 
36 speculation and debate among scholars. The most common interpretation is to 

treat varna as a broad all-India aggregative classification, while jati is taken to 
be a regional or local sub-classification involving a much more complex system

Soc ia l Institutions: Continuity and  Change

consisting of hundreds or even thousands of castes and 
sub-castes. This means that while the four varna classiÞcation Ayyankali 
is common to all of India, the jati hierarchy has more local (1863 – 1914)
classiÞcations that vary from region to region.   

Opinions also differ on the exact age of the caste 
system. It is generally agreed though, that the four varna 
classiÞcation is roughly three thousand years old. However, 
the caste system stood for different things in different time 
periods, so that it is misleading to think of the same system 
continuing for three thousand years. In its earliest phase, 
in the late Vedic period roughly between 900  500 BC, 
the caste system was really a varna system and consisted 
of only four major divisions. These divisions were not very 
elaborate or very rigid, and they were not determined by 
birth. Movement across the categories seems to have been 
not only possible but quite common. It is only in the post-
Vedic period that caste became the rigid institution that is 
familiar to us from well known deÞnitions. 

The most commonly cited deÞning features of caste are 
the following: Ayya nka li, b orn in Kera la ,

2. Membership in a caste involves strict rules about 
marriage. Caste groups are endogamous, i.e. marriage is restricted to 
members of the group.

3. Caste membership also involves rules about food and food-sharing. What 
kinds of food may or may not be eaten is prescribed and who one may share 
food with is also speciÞed.

4. Caste involves a system consisting of many castes arranged in a hierarchy 
of rank and status. In theory, every person has a caste, and every caste 
has a speciÞed place in the hierarchy of all castes. While the hierarchical 
position of many castes, particularly in the middle ranks, may vary from 
region to region, there is always a hierarchy.

5. Castes also involve sub-divisions within themselves, i.e., castes almost 
always have sub-castes and sometimes sub-castes may also have 
sub-castes. This is referred to as a segmental organisation.

6. Castes were traditionally linked to occupations. A person born into a caste 37
could only practice the occupation associated with that caste, so that 
occupations were hereditary, i.e. passed on from generation to generation.

On the other hand, a particular occupation could only be 
Jotirao Govindrao Phule pursued by the caste associated with it – members of other 

(1827 – 1890) castes could not enter the occupation.

These features are the prescribed rules found in 
ancient scriptural texts. Since these prescriptions were 
not always practiced, we cannot say to what extent these 
rules actually determined the empirical reality of caste – its 
concrete meaning for the people living at that time. As you 
can see, most of the prescriptions involved prohibitions 
or restrictions of various sorts. It is also clear from the 
historical evidence that caste was a very unequal institution 
– some castes benefitted greatly from the system, while 
others were condemned to a life of endless labour and 
subordination. Most important, once caste became rigidly 
determined by birth, it was in principle impossible for a 
person to ever change their life circumstances. Whether 
they deserved it or not, an upper caste person would always

its rules of purity and  pollution. Theoretically, the caste system can be understood as 
In  1873 h e  f o u n d e d  t h e the combination of two sets of principles, one based on 
Sa tya sho d ha k Sa m a j (Truth difference and separation and the other on wholism and 
Seekers Soc ie ty), w hic h w a s hierarchy. Each caste is supposed to be different from – and 
d evo ted  to  sec uring  huma n is therefore strictly separated from – every other caste. Many

the mixing of castes – rules ranging from marriage, food 
sharing and social interaction to occupation. On the other 

hand, these different and separated castes do not have an individual existence – 
they can only exist in relation to a larger whole, the totality of society consisting 
of all castes. Further, this societal whole or system is a hierarchical rather than 
egalitarian system. Each individual caste occupies not just a distinct place, 
but also an ordered rank – a particular position in a ladder-like arrangement 
going from highest to lowest. 

The hierarchical ordering of castes is based on the distinction between 
‘purity’ and ‘pollution’. This is a division between something believed to be 
closer to the sacred (thus connoting ritual purity), and something believed to be 
distant from or opposed to the sacred, therefore considered ritually polluting. 
Castes that are considered ritually pure have high status, while those considered 
less pure or impure have low status. As in all societies, material power (i.e., 
economic or military power) is closely associated with social status, so that 
those in power tend to be of high status, and vice versa. Historians believe that 

38 those who were defeated in wars were often assigned low caste status. 

Finally, castes are not only unequal to each other in ritual terms, they are 
also supposed to be complementary and non-competing groups. In other words,

each caste has its own place in the system which cannot 
be taken by any other caste. Since caste is also linked with Savitri Bai Phule 
occupation, the system functions as the social division of (1831–1897)
labour, except that, in principle, it allows no mobility.

Colonialism and Caste

Compared to the ancient past, we know a lot more about 
caste in our recent history. If modern history is taken to 
begin with the nineteenth century, then Indian Independence 
in 1947 offers a natural dividing line between the colonial 
period (roughly 150 years from around 1800 to 1947) and 
the post-Independence or post-colonial period (the seven 
decades from 1947 to the present day). The present form of 
caste as a social institution has been shaped very strongly 
by both the colonial period as well as the rapid changes that 
have come about in independent India.

the country efficiently. Some of these efforts took the shape 
of very methodical and intensive surveys and reports on the 
‘customs and manners’ of various tribes and castes all over 
the country. Many British administrative officials were also amateur ethnologists 
and took great interest in pursuing such surveys and studies. 

But by far the most important official effort to collect information on caste 
was through the census. First begun in the 1860s, the census became a 
regular ten-yearly exercise conducted by the British Indian government from 
1881 onwards. The 1901 Census under the direction of Herbert Risley was 
particularly important as it sought to collect information on the social hierarchy 
of caste – i.e., the social order of precedence in particular regions, as to the 
position of each caste in the rank order. This effort had a huge impact on 
social perceptions of caste and hundreds of petitions were addressed to the 
Census Commissioner by representatives of different castes claiming a higher 
position in the social scale and offering historical and scriptural evidence for 
their claims. Overall, scholars feel that this kind of direct attempt to count caste 
and to officially record caste status changed the institution itself. Before this 39
kind of intervention, caste identities had been much more fluid and less rigid; 
once they began to be counted and recorded, caste began to take on a new life.

The administration also took an interest in the welfare

(1879–1973) Government of India Act of 1935 was passed which gave 

legal recognition to the lists or ‘schedules’ of castes and 
tribes marked out for special treatment by the state. This is 
how the terms ‘Scheduled Tribes’ and the ‘Scheduled Castes’ 
came into being. Castes at the bottom of the hierarchy that 
suffered severe discrimination, including all the so-called 
‘untouchable’ castes, were included among the Scheduled 
Castes. (You will read more on untouchability and the 
struggles against it in Chapter 5 on social exclusion.)

Thus colonialism brought about major changes in the 
institution of caste. Perhaps it would be more accurate to 
say that the institution of caste underwent fundamental 
changes during the colonial period.  Not just India, but the

classes” and particularly the untouchable castes predated 
the nationalist movement, having begun in the second half 

of the nineteenth century. This was an initiative taken from both ends of the 
caste spectrum – by upper caste progressive reformers as well as by members 
of the lower castes such as Mahatma Jotiba Phule and Babasaheb Ambedkar 
in western India, Ayyankali, Sri Narayana Guru, Iyotheedass and Periyar (E.V. 
Ramaswamy Naickar) in the South. Both Mahatma Gandhi and Babasaheb 
Ambedkar began organising protests against untouchability from the 1920s 
onwards. Anti-untouchability programmes became a significant part of the 
Congress agenda so that, by the time Independence was on the horizon, there was 
a broad agreement across the spectrum of the nationalist movement to abolish 
caste distinctions. The dominant view in the nationalist movement was to treat 
caste as a social evil and as a colonial ploy to divide Indians. But the nationalist 
leaders, above all, Mahatma Gandhi, were able to simultaneously work for the 
upliftment of the lower castes, advocate the abolition of untouchability and 
other caste restrictions, and, at the same time, reassure the landowning upper 

40 castes that their interests, too, would be looked after.

The post-Independence Indian state inherited and reflected these 
contradictions. On the one hand, the state was committed to the abolition of

Soc ia l Institutions: Continuity and  Change

caste and explicitly wrote this into the Constitution. 
On the other hand, the state was both unable and Sri Narayana Guru 
unwilling to push through radical reforms which (1856 – 1928)
would have undermined the economic basis for caste 
inequality. At yet another level, the state assumed 
that if it operated in a caste-blind manner, this would 
automatically lead to the undermining of caste based 
privileges and the eventual abolition of the institution. 
For example, appointments to government jobs took 
no account of caste, thus leaving the well-educated 
upper castes and the ill-educated or often illiterate 
lower castes to compete on “equal” terms. The only 
exception to this was in the form of reservations for 
the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. 

The development activity of the state and the 
growth of private industry also affected caste indirectly 
through the speeding up and intensification of 
economic change. Modern industry created all kinds 
of new jobs for which there were no caste rules. 
Urbanisation and the conditions of collective living 
in the cities made it difficult for the caste-segregated 
patterns of social interaction to survive. At a different Sri Narayana  Guru, born in Kera la ,

in the textile mills of Mumbai (then Bombay), the 
jute mills of Kolkata (then Calcutta), or elsewhere, 
continued to be organised along caste and kinship-
based lines. The middle men who recruited labour for factories tended to 
recruit them from their own caste and region so that particular departments 
or shop floors were often dominated by specific castes. Prejudice against the 
untouchables remained quite strong and was not absent from the city, though 
not as extreme as it could be in the village.

Not surprisingly, it was in the cultural and domestic spheres that caste 
has proved strongest. Endogamy, or the practice of marrying within the 
caste, remained largely unaffected by modernisation and change. Even today, 
most marriages take place within caste boundaries, although there are more 
intercaste marriages. While some boundaries may have become more flexible or 
porous, the borders between groups of castes of similar socio-economic status 
are still heavily patrolled.  41

has been deeply conditioned by caste. While its functioning 
M. N. Srinivas has become more and more complex and hard to predict, 
(1916–1999) it cannot be denied that caste remains central to electoral 

politics. Since the 1980s we have also seen the emergence 
of explicitly caste-based political parties. In the early 
general elections, it seemed as though caste solidarities 
were decisive in winning elections. But the situation soon 
got very complicated as parties competed with each other 
in utilising the same kind of caste calculus.  

Sociologists and social anthropologists coined many new 
concepts to try and understand these processes of change. 
Perhaps the most common of these are ‘sanskritisation’ 
and ‘dominant caste’, both contributed by M.N. Srinivas, 
but discussed extensively and criticised by other scholars. 

‘Sanskritisation’ refers to a process whereby members of 
a (usually middle or lower) caste attempt to raise their own

land rights now came to be vested in the next layer of 
claimants, those who were involved in the management of agriculture but were 
not themselves the cultivators. These intermediate castes in turn depended on 
the labour of the lower castes including specially the ‘untouchable’ castes for 
tilling and tending the land. However, once they got land rights, they acquired 
considerable economic power. Their large numbers also gave them political 
power in the era of electoral democracy based on universal adult franchise. 
Thus, these intermediate castes became the ‘dominant’ castes in the country 
side and played a decisive role in regional politics and the agrarian economy. 
Examples of such dominant castes include the Yadavs of Bihar and Uttar 
Pradesh, the Vokkaligas of Karnataka, the Reddys and Khammas of Andhra 
Pradesh, the Marathas of Maharashtra, the Jats of Punjab, Haryana and 
Western Uttar Pradesh and the Patidars of Gujarat. 

One of the most significant yet paradoxical changes in the caste system 
in the contemporary period is that it has tended to become ‘invisible’ for the 

42 upper caste, urban middle and upper classes. For these groups, who have 
benefited the most from the developmental policies of the post-colonial era, 
caste has appeared to decline in significance precisely because it has done its

job so well. Their caste status had been crucial in ensuring that these groups 
had the necessary economic and educational resources to take full advantage 
of the opportunities offered by rapid development. In particular, the upper 
caste elite were able to benefit from subsidised public education, specially 
professional education in science, technology, medicine and management. 
At the same time, they were also able to take advantage of the expansion of public 
sector jobs in the early decades after independence. In this initial period, their lead over 
the rest of society (in terms of education) ensured that they did not face any 
serious competition. As their privileged status got consolidated in the second 
and third generations, these groups began to believe that their advancement 
had little to do with caste. Certainly for the third generations from these groups 
their economic and educational capital alone is quite sufficient to ensure that 
they will continue to get the best in terms of life chances. For this group, it 
now seems that caste plays no part in their public lives, being limited to the 
personal sphere of religious practice or marriage and kinship. However, a further 
complication is introduced by the fact that this is a differentiated group. Although 
the privileged as a group are overwhelmingly upper caste, not all upper caste 
people are privileged, some being poor.

For the scheduled castes and tribes and the backward castes – the opposite 
has happened. For them, caste has become all too visible, indeed their caste has 
tended to eclipse the other dimensions of their identities. Because they have 
no inherited educational and social capital, and because they must compete 
with an already entrenched upper caste group, they cannot afford to abandon 
their caste identity for it is one of the few collective assets they have. Moreover, 
they continue to suffer from discrimination of various kinds. The policies of 
reservation and other forms of protective discrimination instituted by the state 
in response to political pressure serve as their lifelines. But using this lifeline 
tends to make their caste the all-important and often the only aspect of their 
identity that the world recognises. 

3.2 tribal Communities

‘Tribe’ is a modern term for communities that are very old, being among the 
oldest inhabitants of the sub-continent. Tribes in India have generally been 
defined in terms of what they were not. Tribes were communities that did not 
practice a religion with a written text; did not have a state or political form of 
the normal kind and did not have sharp class divisions. 

ClassifiCations of tribal soCieties

In terms of positive characteristics, tribes have been classified according to their 43
‘permanent’ and ‘acquired’ traits. Permanent traits include region, language, 
physical characteristics and ecological habitat.

Permanent traits

The tribal population of India is widely dispersed, but there are also 
concentrations in certain regions. About 85% of the tribal population lives in 
‘middle India’, a wide band stretching from Gujarat and Rajasthan in the west 
to West Bengal and Odisha in the east, with Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, 
Chattisgarh and parts of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh forming the heart 
of this region. Of the remaining 15%, over 11% is in the North Eastern states, 
leaving only a little over 3% living in the rest of India. If we look at the share 
of tribals in the state population, then the North Eastern states have the 
highest concentrations, with all states, except Assam, having concentrations 
of more than 30%, and some, like Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram 
and Nagaland with more than 60% and upto 95% of tribal population. In the 
rest of the country, however, the tribal population is very small, being less than 
12% in all states except Odisha and Madhya Pradesh. The ecological habitats 
covered includes hills, forests, rural plains and urban industrial areas.

In terms of language, tribes are categorised into four categories. Two of them, 
Indo-Aryan and Dravidian, are shared by the rest of the Indian population as 
well, and tribes account for only about 1% of the former and about 3% of the 
latter. The other two language groups, the Austric and Tibeto-Burman, are 
primarily spoken by tribals, who account for all of the first and over 80% of the 
second group. In physical-racial terms, tribes are classified under the Negrito, 
Australoid, Mongoloid, Dravidian and Aryan categories. The last two are again 
shared with the rest of the population of India.

In terms of size, tribes vary a great deal, ranging from about seven million 
to some Andamanese islanders who may number less than a hundred persons. 
The biggest tribes are the Gonds, Bhils, Santhals, Oraons, Minas, Bodos and 
Mundas, all of whom are at least a million strong. The total population of tribes 
amounts to about 8.2% of the population of India, or about 84 million persons 
according to the 2001 Census. According to Census Report 2011, it is 8.6% 
of the population of India, or about 104 million tribal persons in the country.

acquired traits

Classifications based on acquired traits use two main criteria – mode of 
livelihood, and extent of incorporation into Hindu society – or a combination 
of the two. 

On the basis of livelihood, tribes can be categorised into fishermen, food 
gatherers and hunters, shifting cultivators, peasants and plantation and 
industrial workers. However, the dominant classification both in academic 
sociology as well as in politics and public affairs is the degree of assimilation 

44 into Hindu society. Assimilation can be seen either from the point of view of 
the tribes, or (as has been most often the case) from the point of view of the 
dominant Hindu mainstream. From the tribes’ point of view, apart from the 

Reprint 2025-26



Soc ia l Institutions: Continuity and  Change

extent of assimilation, attitude towards Hindu society is also a major criterion, 
with differentiation between tribes that are positively inclined towards Hinduism 
and those who resist or oppose it. From the mainstream point of view, tribes 
may be viewed in terms of the status accorded to them in Hindu society, ranging 
from the high status given to some, to the generally low status accorded to most. 

tribe – the Career of a ConCePt

During the 1960s scholars debated 
whether tribes should be seen as 
one end of a continuum with caste-
based (Hindu) peasant society, or 
whether they were an altogether 
different kind of community. Those 
who argued for the continuum saw 
tribes as not being fundamentally 
different from caste-peasant 
society, but merely less stratified 
(fewer levels of hierarchy) and with 
a more community-based rather 
than individual notion of resource 
ownership. However, opponents 
argued that tribes were wholly 
different from castes because 
they had no notion of purity and A tribal village fair

pollution which is central to the 
caste system.

In short, the argument for a tribe-caste distinction was founded on an 
assumed cultural difference between Hindu castes, with their beliefs in purity 
and pollution and hierarchical integration, and ‘animist’ tribals with their more 
egalitarian and kinship based modes of social organisation.

By the 1970s all the major definitions of tribe were shown to be faulty. 
It was pointed out that the tribe-peasantry distinction did not hold in terms 
of any of the commonly advanced criteria: size, isolation, religion, and 
means of livelihood. Some Indian “tribes” like Santhal, Gonds, and Bhils are 
very large and spread over extensive territory. Certain tribes like Munda, Hos 
and others have long since turned to settled agriculture, and even hunting 
gathering tribes, like the Birhors of Bihar employ specialised households to 
make baskets, press oil etc. It has also been pointed out in a number of cases, 
that in the absence of other alternatives, “castes” (or non-tribals) have turned 
to hunting and gathering.

The discussion on caste-tribe differences was accompanied by a large body 45
of literature on the mechanisms through which tribes were absorbed into Hindu 
society, throughout the ages – through Sanskritisation, acceptance into the 

Reprint 2025-26



Ind ian Soc iety

Shudra fold following conquest by caste Hindus, through acculturation and so 
on. The whole span of Indian history is often seen as an absorption of different 
tribal groups into caste Hindu society at varying levels of the hierarchy, as their 
lands were colonised and the forests cut down. This is seen as either natural, 
parallel to the process by which all groups are assimiliated into Hinduism as 
sects; or it is seen as exploitative. The early school of anthropologists tended to 
emphasise the cultural aspects of tribal absorption into the mainstream, while 
the later writers have concentrated on the exploitative and political nature of 
the incorporation.

Some scholars have also argued that there is no coherent basis for treating 
tribes as “pristine” – i.e., original or pure – societies uncontaminated by 
civilisation. They propose instead that tribes should really be seen as “secondary” 
phenomena arising out of the exploitative and colonialist contact between pre-
existing states and non-state groups like the tribals. This contact itself creates 
an ideology of “tribalism” – the tribal groups begin to define themselves as 
tribals in order to distinguish themselves from the newly encountered others. 

Nevertheless, the idea that tribes are like stone age hunting and gathering 
societies that have remained untouched by time is still common, even though 
this has not been true for a long time. To begin with, adivasis were not always the 
oppressed groups they are now – there were several Gond kingdoms in Central 
India such as that of Garha Mandla, or Chanda. Many of the so-called Rajput 
kingdoms of central and western India actually emerged through a process of 
stratification among adivasi communities themselves. Adivasis often exercised 
dominance over the plains people through their capacity to raid them, and 
through their services as local militias. They also occupied a special trade niche, 
trading forest produce, salt and elephants. Moreover, the capitalist economy’s 
drive to exploit forest resources and minerals and to recruit cheap labour has 
brought tribal societies in contact with mainstream society a long time ago.

national DeveloPment versus tribal DeveloPment

The imperatives of ‘development’ have governed attitudes towards tribes and 
shaped the policies of the state. National development, particularly in the 
Nehruvian era, involved the building of large dams, factories and mines. Because 
the tribal areas were located in mineral rich and forest covered parts of the 
country, tribals have paid a disproportionate price for the development of the 
rest of Indian society. This kind of development has benefited the mainstream 
at the expense of the tribes. The process of dispossessing tribals of their land 
has occurred as a necessary byproduct of the exploitation of minerals and the 
utilisation of favourable sites for setting up hydroelectric power plants, many 
of which were in tribal areas.  

46 The loss of the forests on which most tribal communities depended has been 
a major blow. Forests started to be systematically exploited in British times 
and the trend continued after independence. The coming of private property

in land has also adversely affected tribals, whose community-based forms of 
collective ownership were placed at a disadvantage.

Many tribal concentration regions and states have also been experiencing 
the problem of heavy in-migration of non-tribals in response to the pressures 
of development. This threatens to disrupt and overwhelm tribal communities 
and cultures, besides accelerating the process of exploitation of tribals. The 
industrial areas of Jharkhand for example have suffered a dilution of the tribal 
share of population. But the most dramatic cases are probably in the North-
East. A state like Tripura had the tribal share of its population halved within 
a single decade, reducing them to a minority. Similar pressure is being felt by 
Arunachal Pradesh. 

Tribal idenTiTy Today

Forced incorporation of tribal communities into mainstream processes 
has had its impact on tribal culture and society as much as its economy. 
Tribal identities today are formed by this interactional process rather 
than any primordial (orginal, ancient) characteristics peculiar to tribes. 
Because the interaction with the mainstream has generally been on terms 
unfavourable to the tribal communities, many tribal identities today are 
centred on ideas of resistance and opposition to the overwhelming force of 
the non-tribal world. 

The positive impact 
of successes – such 
as the achievement of 
statehood for Jharkhand 
and Chattisgarh after 
a long struggle – is 
moderated by continuing 
problems. Many of the 
states of the North-
East, for example, have 
been living for decades 
under special laws that 
limit the civil liberties 
of citizens.

an educated middle class among tribal communities. Most visible in the 
North-eastern states, this is now a segment beginning to be seen in the 47
rest of the country as well, particularly among members of the larger tribal 
communities. In conjunction with policies of reservation (about which you

will learn more in Chapter 5), education is creating an urbanised professional 
class. As tribal societies get more differntiated – i.e., develop class and other 
divisions within themselves – different bases are growing for the assertion of 
tribal identity. 

Two broad sets of issues have been most important in giving rise to tribal 
movements. These are issues relating to control over vital economic resources 
like land and specially forests, and issues relating to matters of ethnic-cultural 
identity. The two can often go together, but with differentiation of tribal society 
they may also diverge. The reasons why the middle classes within tribal societies 
may assert their tribal identity may be different from the reasons why poor and 
uneducated tribals join tribal movements. As with any other community, it is 
the relationship between these kinds of internal dynamics and external forces 
that will shape the future.

3.3 Family and Kinship

Each one of us is born into a family, and most of us spend long years within 
it. Usually we feel very strongly about our family. Sometimes we feel very good 
about our parents, grandparents, siblings, uncles, aunts and cousins, whereas 
at others we don’t. On the one hand, we resent their interference, and yet we 
miss their overbearing ways when we are away from them. The family is a space 
of great warmth and care. It has also been a site of bitter conflicts, injustice and 
violence. Female infanticide, violent conflicts between brothers over property 
and ugly legal disputes are as much part of family and kinship as are stories 
of compassion, sacrifice and care.

The structure of the family can be studied both as a social institution 
48 in itself and also in its relationship to other social institutions of society. In 

itself a family can be defined as nuclear or extended. It can be male-headed 

Reprint 2025-26



Soc ia l Institutions: Continuity and  Change

or female-headed. The line of descent can be matrilineal or patrilineal. 
This internal structure of the family is usually related to other structures 
of society, namely political, economic, cultural etc. Thus the migration 
of men from the villages of the Himalayan region can lead to an unusual 
proportion of women-headed families in the village. Or the work schedules 
of young parents in the software industry in India may lead to increasing 
number of grandparents moving in as care-givers to young grandchildren. 
The composition of the family and its structure thereby changes and these 
changes can be understood in relation to other changes in society. The 
family (the private sphere) is linked to the economic, political, cultural, and 
educational (the public) spheres.

The family is an integral part of our lives. We take it for granted. We 
also assume that other peoples families must be like our own. As we saw 
however, families have different structures and these structures change. 
Sometimes these changes occur accidentally, as when a war takes place or 
people migrate in search of work. Sometimes these changes are purposely 
brought about, as when young people decide to choose their spouses 
instead of letting elders decide. Or when same sex love is expressed openly 
in society. 

It is evident from the kind of changes that take place that not only 
have family structures changed, but cultural ideas, norms and values also 
change. These changes are however not so easy to bring about. Both history 
and contemporary times suggest that often change in family and marriage 
norms are resisted violently. The family has many dimensions to it. In India 
however discussions on the family have often revolved around the nuclear 
and extended family. 

NUCLEAR AND EXTENDED FAMILY 

A nuclear family consists of only one set of parents and their children. An 
extended family (commonly known as the joint family) can take different 
forms, but has more than one couple, and often more than two generations, 
living together. This could be a set of brothers with their individual families, 
or an elderly couple with their sons and grandsons and their respective 
families. The extended family often is seen as symptomatic of India. Yet 
this is by no means the dominant form now or earlier. It was conÞned to 
certain sections and certain regions of the community. Indeed the term 
joint family itself is not a native category. As I.P. Desai observes, The 
expression joint family is not the translation of any Indian word like that. 
It is interesting to note that the words used for joint family in most of the 
Indian languages are the equivalents of translations of the English word 49
joint family. (Desai 1964:40)

the diverse forms of the family

Studies have shown how diverse family forms are found in different societies. 
With regard to the rule of residence, some societies are matrilocal in their 
marriage and family customs while others are patrilocal. In the first case, 
the newly married couple stays with the woman’s parents, whereas in the 
second case the couple lives with the man’s parents. With regard to the rules 
of inheritance, matrilineal societies pass on property from mother to daughter 
while patrilineal societies do so from father to son. A patriarchal family structure 
exists where the men exercise authority and dominance, and matriarchy where 
the women play a similarly dominant role. However, matriarchy – unlike 
patriarchy – has been a theoretical rather than an empirical concept. There is 
no historical or anthropological evidence of matriarchy – i.e., societies where 
women exercise dominance. However, there do exist matrilineal societies, i.e., 
societies where women inherit property from their mothers but do not exercise 
control over it, nor are they the decision makers in public affairs.

We usually think of markets as places where things are bought and sold.  In 
this common everyday usage, the word ‘market’ may refer to particular markets 
that we may know of, such as the market next to the railway station, the fruit 
market, or the wholesale market.  Sometimes we refer not to the physical place, 
but to the gathering of people – buyers and sellers – who constitute the market. 
Thus, for example, a weekly vegetable market may be found in different places 
on different days of the week in neighbouring villages or urban neighbourhoods. 
In yet another sense, ‘market’ refers to an area or category of trade or business, 
such as the market for cars or the market for readymade clothes.  A related 
sense refers to the demand for a particular product or service, such as the 
market for computer professionals.

What all of these meanings have in common is that they refer to a  specific 
market, whose meaning is readily understandable from the context.  But what 
does it mean to speak of ‘the market’ in a general way without refering to any 
particular place, gathering of people, or field of commercial activity?  This 
usage includes not only all of the specific senses mentioned above, but also 
the entire spectrum of economic activities and institutions. In this very broad 
sense, then, ‘the market’ is almost equivalent to ‘the economy’.  We are used to 
thinking of the market as an economic institution, but this chapter will show 
you that the market is also a social institution.  In its own way, the market 
is comparable to more obviously social institutions like caste, tribe or family 
discussed in Chapter 3.  

4.1 Sociological PerSPectiveS on MarketS

      and the econoMy

The discipline of economics is aimed at understanding and explaining how 
markets work in modern capitalist economies – for instance, how prices are 
determined, the probable impact of specific kinds of investment, or the factors 
that influence people to save or spend.  So what does sociology have to contribute 
to the study of markets that goes beyond what economics can tell us? 

To answer this question, we need to go back briefly to eighteenth century 
England and the beginnings of modern economics, which at that time was called 
‘political economy’. The most famous of the early political economists was Adam 
Smith, who in his book, The Wealth of Nations, attempted to understand the 
market economy that was just emerging at that time. Smith argued that the 
market economy is made up of a series of individual exchanges or transactions, 
which automatically create a functioning and ordered system.  This happens 
even though none of the individuals involved in the millions of transactions 

54 had intended to create a system.

Modern economics developed from the ideas of early thinkers such as Adam 
Smith, and is based on the idea that the economy can be studied as a separate

The Market as a  Soc ia l Institution

part of society that operates according to its own laws, 
leaving out the larger social or political context in which Adam Smith 
markets operate. In contrast to this approach, sociologists (1723-90)
have attempted to develop an alternative way of studying 
economic institutions and processes within the larger 
social framework. 

Sociologists view markets as social institutions that 
are constructed in culturally specific ways. For example, 
markets are often controlled or organised by particular social 
groups or classes, and have specific connections to other 
institutions, social processes and structures. Sociologists 
often express this idea by saying that economies are socially 
‘embedded’. This is illustrated by two examples, one of a 
weekly tribal haat, and the other of a ‘traditional business 
community’ and its trading networks in colonial India.

as moneylenders, entertainers, astrologers, and a host of 
other specialists offering their services and wares. In rural India there are also 
specialised markets that take place at less frequent intervals, for instance, cattle 
markets. These periodic markets link different regional and local economies 
together, and link them to the wider national economy and to towns and 
metropolitan centres.

The weekly haat is a common sight in rural and even urban India. In hilly 
and forested areas (especially those  inhabited by adivasis), where settlements 
are far-flung, roads and communications poor, and the economy relatively 
undeveloped, the weekly market is the major institution for the exchange of 
goods as well as for social intercourse. Local people come to the market to 
sell their agricultural or forest produce to traders, who carry it to the towns 
for resale, and they buy essentials such as salt and agricultural implements, 
and consumption items such as bangles and jewellery. But for many visitors, 
the primary reason to come to the market is social – to meet kin, to arrange 
marriages, exchange gossip, and so on. 55

its character has changed over time. After these remote areas were brought

A weekly market in tribal area

under the control of the colonial state, they were gradually incorporated into 
the wider regional and national economies. Tribal areas were ‘opened up’ by 
building roads and ‘pacifying’ the local people (many of whom resisted colonial 
rule through their so-called ‘tribal rebellions’), so that the rich forest and 
mineral resources of these areas could be exploited. This led to the influx of 
traders, moneylenders, and other non-tribal people from the plains into these 
areas. The local tribal economy was transformed as forest produce was sold 
to outsiders, and money and new kinds of goods entered the system. Tribals 
were also recruited as labourers to work on plantations and mines that were 
established under colonialism.  A ‘market’ for tribal labour developed during the 
colonial period. Due to all these changes, local tribal economies became linked 
into wider markets, usually with very negative consequences for local people. For 
example, the entry of traders and moneylenders from outside the local area led 
to the impoverishment of adivasis, many of whom lost their land to outsiders. 

The weekly market as a social institution, the links between the local tribal 
economy and the outside, and the exploitative economic relationships between 
adivasis and others, are illustrated by a study of a weekly market in Bastar 
district. This district is populated mainly by Gonds, an adivasi group. At the 
weekly market, you find local people, including tribals and non-tribals (mostly 
Hindus), as well as outsiders – mainly Hindu traders of various castes. Forest 
officials also come to the market to conduct business with adivasis who work for 
the Forest Department, and the market attracts a variety of specialists selling 
their goods and services. The major goods that are exchanged in the market 
are manufactured goods (such as jewellery and trinkets, pots and knives), 

56 non-local foods (such as salt and haldi (turmeric)), local food and agricultural 
produce and manufactured items (such as bamboo baskets), and forest produce 
(such as tamarind and oil-seeds). The forest produce that is brought by the

adivasis is purchased by traders who carry it to towns. In the market, the buyers 
are mostly adivasis while the sellers are mainly caste Hindus. Adivasis earn 
cash from the sale of forest and agricultural produce and from wage labour, 
which they spend in the market mainly on low-value trinkets and jewellery, 
and consumption items such as manufactured cloth.

Caste-based markets and trading networks in preColonial 
and Colonial india

In some traditional accounts of Indian economic history, India’s economy and 
society are seen as unchanging.  Economic transformation was thought to 
have begun only with the advent of colonialism.  It was assumed that India 
consisted of ancient village communities that were relatively self-sufficient, 
and that their economies were organised primarily on the basis of non-market 
exchange. Under colonialism and in the early post-independence period, the 
penetration of the commercial money economy into local agrarian economies,

and their incorporation into wider networks of exchange, was thought to have 
brought about radical social and economic changes in rural and urban society. 
While colonialism certainly brought about major economic transformations, for 
example due to the demand that land revenue be paid in cash, recent historical 
research has shown that much of India’s economy was already extensively 
monetised (trade was carried out using money) in the late pre-colonial period. 
And while various kinds of non-market exchange systems (such as the ‘jajmani 
system’) did exist in many villages and regions, even during the precolonial 
period villages were incorporated into wider networks of exchange through 
which agricultural products and other goods circulated (Bayly 1983, Stein and 
Subrahmanyam 1996).  It now seems that the sharp line that was often drawn 
between the ‘traditional’ and the ‘modern’ (or the pre-capitalist and capitalist) 
economy is actually rather fuzzy. Recent historical research has also highlighted 
the extensive and sophisticated trading networks that existed in pre-colonial 
India. Of course, we know that for centuries India was a major manufacturer 
and exporter of handloom cloth (both ordinary cotton and luxury silks), as well 
as the source of many other goods (such as spices) that were in great demand 
in the global market, especially in Europe. So it is not surprising that pre-
colonial India had well-organised manufacturing centres as well as indigenous 
merchant groups, trading networks, and banking systems that enabled trade 
to take place within India, and between India and the rest of the world. These 
traditional trading communities or castes had their own systems of banking 
and credit. For instance, an important instrument of exchange and credit was 
the hundi, or bill of exchange (like a credit note), which allowed merchants to 
engage in long-distance trade. Because trade took place primarily within the 
caste and kinship networks of these communities, a merchant in one part of 
the country could issue a hundi that would be honoured by a merchant in 
another place.

defined according to these principles, and not a government-controlled central 
bank, that … assured public confidence in individual Nakarattars as representatives

soCial organisation of markets –  ‘traditional 
business Communities’

Many sociological studies 
of the Indian economy have 
focused on ‘ t radi t ional 
merchant communities’ or 
castes such as the Nakarattars. 
As you have already learned, 
there is a close connection 
between the caste system 
and the economy, in terms 
of landholding, occupational 
differentiation, and so on. 
This is also true in the case 
of trade and markets. In 
fact, ‘Vaisyas’ constitute 
one of the four varnas – an 
indication of the importance 
of the merchant and of trade 

Agricultural work in a village
or business in Indian society 
since ancient times. However, like the other varnas, ‘Vaisya’ is often a status 
that is claimed or aspired to rather than a fixed identity or social status. 
Although there are ‘Vaisya’ communities (such as banias in North India), whose 
traditional occupation has been trade or commerce for a long time, there are 
some caste groups that have entered into trade. Such groups tend to acquire 
or claim ‘Vaisya’ status in the process of upward mobility. Like the history 
of all caste communities, in most cases there is a complex relationonship 
between caste status or identity, and caste practices, including occupation. 
The ‘traditional business communities’ in India include not only ‘Vaisyas’, 
but also other groups with distinctive religious or other community identities, 
such as the Parsis, Sindhis, Bohras, or Jains. Merchant communities did not 
always have a high status in society; for instance, during the colonial period the 
long-distance trade in salt was controlled by a marginalised ‘tribal’ group, the 
Banjaras. In each case, the particular nature of community institutions and 
ethos gives rise to a different organisation and practice of business.

To understand the operation of markets in India, both in earlier periods and 
at present, we can examine how specific arenas of business are controlled by 
particular communities. One of the reasons for this caste-based specialisation 
is that trade and commerce often operate through caste and kinship networks, 
as we have seen in the case of the Nakarattars. Because businessmen are 
more likely to trust others of their own community or kin group, they tend to 59
do business within such networks rather than with others outside – and this 
tends to create a caste monopoly within certain areas of business.

overturning existing economic institutions, the expansion

moneylending. Like the Nakarattars, the success of the Marwaris rested on 
their extensive social networks, which created the relations of trust necessary to 
operate their banking system. Many Marwari families accumulated enough wealth 
to become moneylenders, and by acting as bankers also helped the commercial 
expansion of the British in India (Hardgrove 2004). In the late colonial period and 
after Independence, some Marwari families transformed themselves into modern 
industrialists, and even today Marwaris control more of India’s industry than 
any other community. This story of the emergence of a new business community 
under colonialism, and its transformation from small migrant traders to merchant 
bankers to industrialists, illustrates the importance of the social context to 
economic processes.

4.2 UnderStanding caPitaliSM aS a Social SySteM

One of the founders of modern sociology, Karl Marx, was also a critic of modern 
capitalism. Marx understood capitalism as a system of commodity production, 
or production for the market, through the use of wage labour. As you have 
already learned, Marx wrote that all economic systems are also social systems. 
Each mode of production consists of particular relations of production, which 
in turn give rise to a specific class structure. He emphasised that the economy 
does not consist of things (goods circulating in the market), but is made up of 
relations between people who are connected to one another through the process 
of production. Under the capitalist mode of production, labour itself becomes a 
commodity, because workers must sell their labour power in the market to earn 
a wage. This gives rise to two basic classes – capitalists, who own the means 
of production (such as the factories), and workers, who sell their labour to the 
capitalists. The capitalist class is able to profit from this system by paying the 
workers less than the value of what they actually produce, and so extracting 
surplus value from their labour. Marx’s theory of capitalist economy and society 
provided the inspiration for numerous theories and debates about the nature 
of capitalism throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Commoditisation and Consumption

The growth of capitalism around the world has meant the extension of markets 
into places and spheres of life that were previously untouched by this system. 
Commodification occurs when things that were earlier not traded in the market 
become commodities. For instance, labour or skills become things that can be 
bought and sold. According to Marx and other critics of capitalism, the process 
of commodification has negative social effects. The commodification of labour 
is one example, but there are many other examples in contemporary society. 
For instance, there is a controversy about the sale of kidneys by the poor to 61
cater to rich patients who need kidney transplants. According to many people, 
human organs should not become commodities. In earlier times, human beings

themselves were bought and sold as slaves, but today it is considered immoral 
to treat people as commodities. But in modern society, almost everyone accepts 
the idea that a person’s labour can be bought, or that other services or skills 
can be provided in exchange for money. This is a situation that is found only 
in capitalist societies, according to Marx. 

In contemporary India, we can observe that things or processes that 
earlier were not part of market exchange become commodified. For example, 
traditionally, marriages were arranged by families, but now there are 
professional marriage bureaus and websites that help people to find brides and 
grooms for a fee. Another example are the many private institutes that offer 
courses in ‘personality development’, spoken English, and so on, that teach 
students (mostly middle class youth) the cultural and social skills required to 
succeed in the contemporary world. In earlier times, social skills such as good 
manners and etiquette were imparted mainly through the family. Or we could 
think of the burgeoning of privately owned schools and colleges and coaching 
classes as a process of commodification of education.

aCtivity 4.2

Commoditisation or commodification – these are big words that sound very complicated.  
But the p roc ess they refer to is a  familia r one and  it is p resent in our everyday life.  Here is a  
c ommon example – bottled  wa ter. 
In cities and towns and even in most villages now it is possible to buy water packed in sealed 
p lastic  bottles of 2 litres, 1 litre or sma ller c apac ity.  These bottles a re marketed  by a  wide 
variety of companies and there are innumerable brand names.  But this is a  new phenomenon, 
not more than ten or fifteen years old.  It is possible that you yourself may remember a time 
when bottled  water was not a round.  Ask older peop le. Your parents’  genera tion will c erta inly 
remember the initial feeling of novelty when bottled water became widely available.  In your 
grandparents’  genera tion, it was unthinkab le tha t anyone c ould  sell d rinking wa ter, c harge 
money for it.  But today we take bottled  wa ter for g ranted  as a  norma l, c onvenient thing , a  
c ommod ity tha t we c an buy (or sell).
 This is commoditisation/commodification – the process by which something which was not 
a  c ommod ity is made into a  c ommod ity and  bec omes part of the market ec onomy.  
Can you think of other examples of things that have been commodified relatively recently?  
Remember, a  c ommod ity need  not only be a  thing  or ob jec t; it c an a lso be a  servic e.  Try 
a lso to think of things tha t a re not c ommod ities today but c ould  bec ome c ommod ities in

were c ommod ities in the past but have stopped  being c ommod ities today (i.e., they used

4.3  GLOBALISATION – INTERLINKING OF LOCAL, REGIONAL,
   NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS 

Since the late 1980s, India has entered a new era in its economic history, 
following the change in economic policy from one of state-led development to 
liberalisation. This shift also ushered in the era of globalisation, a period in 
which the world is becoming increasingly interconnected  not only economically 
but also culturally and politically. The term globalisation includes a number 
of trends, especially the increase in international movement of commodities, 
money, information, and people, as well as the development of technology (such 
as in computers, telecommunications, and transport) and other infrastructure 
to allow this movement. 

A central feature of globalisation is the increasing extension and integration 
of markets around the world. This integration means that changes in a market 
in one part of the globe may have a profound impact somewhere else far away. 
For instance, Indias booming software industry may face a slump if the U.S.

services industries and business process outsourcing (BPO) industries (such 
as call centres) are some of the major avenues through which India is getting 
connected to the global economy. Companies based in India provide low-cost 
services and labour to customers located in the developed countries of the 
West. We can say that there is now a global market for Indian software labour

also suggests how culture itself may become a commodity. An example is the 
famous annual fair in Pushkar, Rajasthan, to which pastoralists and traders 
come from distant places to buy and sell camels and other livestock. While 
the Pushkar fair continues to be a major social and economic event for local 
people, it is also marketed internationally as a major tourist attraction. The 
fair is all the more attractive to tourists because it comes just before a major 
Hindu religious festival of Kartik Purnima, when pilgrims come to bathe in the 
holy Pushkar Lake. Thus, Hindu pilgrims, camel traders, and foreign tourists 
mingle at this event, exchanging not only livestock and money but also cultural 
symbols and religious merit.

debate on liberalisation – market versus state

The globalisation of the Indian economy has been due primarily to the policy 
of liberalisation that was started in the late 1980s. Liberalisation includes a 
range of policies such as the privatisation of public sector enterprises (selling 
government-owned companies to private companies); loosening of government 
regulations on capital, labour, and trade; a reduction in tariffs and import duties 
so that foreign goods can be imported more easily; and allowing easier access 
for foreign companies to set up industries in India. Another word for such 
changes is marketisation, or the use of markets or market-based processes 
(rather than government regulations or policies) to solve social, political, or 
economic problems. These include relaxation or removal of economic controls 
(deregulation), privatisation of industries, and removing government controls 
over wages and prices. Those who advocate marketisation believe that these 
steps will promote economic growth and prosperity because private industry 
is more efficient than government-owned industry.  

The changes that have been made under the liberalisation programme 
have stimulated economic growth and opened up Indian markets to foreign 
companies.  For example, many foreign branded goods are now sold, which 
were not previously available. Increasing foreign investment is supposed to 
help economic growth and employment. The privatisation of public companies 
is supposed to increase their efficiency and reduce the government’s burden 
of running these companies. However, the impact of liberalisation has been 
mixed.  Many people argue that liberalisation and globalisation have had, or 
will have, a negative net impact on India – that is, the costs and disadvantages 
will be more than the advantages and benefits.  Some sectors of Indian 
industry (like software and information technology) or agriculture (like fish 
or fruit) may benefit from access to a global market, but other sectors (like 
automobiles, electronics or oilseeds) will lose because they cannot compete with 
foreign producers.

66 For example, Indian farmers are now exposed to competition from farmers 
in other countries because import of agricultural products is allowed. Earlier, 
Indian agriculture was protected from the world market by support prices 

Reprint 2025-26



The Market as a  Soc ia l Institution

and subsidies.  Support prices help to ensure a minimum income for farmers 
because they are the prices at which the government agrees to buy agricultural 
commodities.  Subsidies lower the cost of farming because the government 
pays part of the price charged for inputs (such as fertilisers or diesel oil). 
Liberalisation is against this kind of government interference in markets, so 
support prices and subsidies are reduced or withdrawn.  This means that many 
farmers are not able to make a decent living from agriculture. Similarly, small 
manufacturers have been exposed to global competition as foreign goods and 
brands have entered the market, and some have not been able to compete. The 
privatisation or closing of public sector industries has led to loss of employment 
in some sectors, and to growth of unorganised sector employment at the expense 
of the organised sector. This is not good for workers because the organised 
sector generally offers better paid and more regular or permanent jobs. (See 
the chapters on agrarian change and industry  in the other textbook for Class 
XII, Social Change and Development in India).

In this chapter we have seen that there are many different kinds of markets 
in contemporary India, from the village haat to the virtual stock exchange. 
These markets are themselves social institutions, and are connected to other 
aspects of the social structure, such as caste and class, in various ways. In 
addition, we have learned that exchange has a social and symbolic significance 
that goes far beyond its immediate economic purpose. Moreover, the ways in 
which goods and services are exchanged or circulate is rapidly changing due 
to the liberalisation of the Indian economy and globalisation. There are many 
different ways and levels at which goods, services, cultural symbols, money, 
and so on, circulate — from the local market in a village or town right up to a 
global trading network such as the Nasdaq. In today’s rapidly changing world, 
it is important to understand how markets are being constantly transformed, 
and the broader social and economic consequences of these changes.

The family, caste, tribe and the market – these are the social institutions that 
have been considered in the last two chapters. These institutions were seen from 
the point of view of their role in forming communities and sustaining society. 
In this chapter we consider an equally important aspect of such institutions, 
namely their role in creating and sustaining patterns of inequality and exclusion.

For most of us who are born and live in India, social inequality and exclusion 
are facts of life. We see beggars in the streets and on railway platforms.  We see 
young children labouring as domestic workers, construction helpers, cleaners 
and helpers in streetside restaurants (dhabas) and tea-shops.  We are not 
surprised at the sight of small children, who work as domestic workers in middle 
class urban homes, carrying the school bags of older children to school.  It does 
not immediately strike us as unjust that some children are denied schooling. 
Some of us read about caste discrimination against children in schools; some of 
us face it.  Likewise, news reports about violence against women and prejudice 
against minority groups and the differently abled are part of our everyday lives. 

This everydayness of social inequality and exclusion often make them 
appear inevitable, almost natural.  If we do sometimes recognise that inequality 
and exclusion are not inevitable, we often think of them as being ‘deserved’ or 
‘justified’ in some sense.  Perhaps the poor and marginalised are where they 
are because they are lacking in ability, or haven’t tried hard enough to improve 
their situation?  We thus tend to blame them for their own plight – if only they 
worked harder or were more intelligent, they wouldn’t be where they are.  

A closer examination will show that few work harder than those who are located 
at the lower ranks of society.  As a South American proverb says – “If hard labour 
were really such a good thing, the rich would keep it all for themselves!”  All over 
the world, back-breaking work like stone breaking, digging, carrying heavy weights, 
pulling rickshaws or carts is invariably done by the poor.  And yet they rarely

shown that such a dramatic rise requires illegal or unscrupulous methods.

Activity 5.1 invites you to rethink the widely held commonsense view that 
hard work alone can improve an individual’s life chances.  It is true that hard 
work matters, and so does individual ability.  If all other things were equal, 
then personal effort, talent and luck would surely account for all the differences 
between individuals.  But, as is almost always the case, all other things are 
not equal.  It is these non-individual or group differences that explain social 
inequality and exclusion.  

5.1 What Is Social about socIal

 InequalIty and exclusIon?

The question being asked in this section has three broad answers which may 
be stated briefly as follows. First, social inequality and exclusion are social 
because they are not about individuals but about groups.  Second, they are 
social in the sense that they are not economic, although there is usually a 
strong link between social and economic inequality.  Third, they are systematic 
and structured – there is a definite pattern to social inqualities.  These three 
broad senses of the ‘social’ will be explored briefly below.  

SociAl InequAlity

In every society, some people have a greater share of valued resources – money, 
property, education, health, and power – than others.  These social resources 
can be divided into three forms of capital – economic capital in the form of 
material assets and income; cultural capital such as educational qualifications 
and status; and social capital in the form of networks of contacts and social 71
associations (Bourdieu 1986).  Often, these three forms of capital overlap and 
one can be converted into the other. For example, a person from a well-off 

Reprint 2025-26



Ind ian Soc iety

family (economic capital) can afford expensive higher education, and so can 
acquire cultural or educational capital. Someone with influential relatives and 
friends (social capital) may – through access to good advice, recommendations 
or information – manage to get a well-paid job. 

Patterns of unequal access to social resources are commonly called social 
inequality.  Some social inequality reflects innate differences between individuals 
for example, their varying abilities and efforts.  Someone may be endowed with 
exceptional intelligence or talent, or may have worked very hard to achieve their 
wealth and status.  However, by and large, social inequality is not the outcome 
of innate or ‘natural’ differences between people, but is produced by the society 
in which they live.  Sociologists use the term social stratification to refer to a 
system by which categories of people in a society are ranked in a hierarchy. 
This hierarchy then shapes people’s identity and experiences, their relations 
with others, as well as their access to resources and opportunities.  Three key 
principles help explain social stratification:
1. Social stratification is a characteristic of society, not simply a function of 

individual differences. Social stratification is a society-wide system that 
unequally distributes social resources among categories of people.  In the 
most technologically primitive societies – hunting and gathering societies, for 
instance – little was produced so only rudimentary social stratification could 
exist.  In more technologically advanced societies where people produce a 
surplus over and above their basic needs, however, social resources are 
unequally distributed to various social categories regardless of people’s 
innate individual abilities.  

2. Social stratification persists over generations.  It is closely linked to the 
family and to the inheritance of social resources from one generation to 
the next.  A person’s social position is ascribed.  That is, children assume 
the social positions of their parents. Within the caste system, birth dictates 
occupational opportunities. The ascribed aspect of social inequality is 
reinforced by the practice of endogamy. That is, marriage is usually restricted 
to members of the same caste, ruling out the potential for blurring caste 
lines through inter-caste marriage.

3. Social stratification is supported by patterns of belief, or ideology.  No 
system of social stratification is likely to persist over generations unless 
it is widely viewed as being either fair or inevitable.  The caste system, for 
example, is justified in terms of the opposition of purity and pollution, 
with the Brahmins designated as the most superior and Dalits as the most 
inferior by virtue of their birth and occupation.  Not everyone, though, 
thinks of a system of inequality as legitimate.  Typically, people with the 
greatest social privileges express the strongest support for systems of 

72 stratification such as caste and race.  Those who have experienced the 
exploitation and humiliation of being at the bottom of the hierarchy are 
most likely to challenge it.

Patterns of Soc ia l Inequa lity and  Exc lusion

Often we discuss social exclusion and discrimination as though they 
pertain to differential economic resources alone. This however is only partially 
true. People often face discrimination and exclusion because of their gender, 
religion, ethnicity, language, caste and disability. Thus, women from a privileged 
background may face sexual harassment in public places. A middle class 
professional from a minority religious or ethnic group may find it difficult to 
get accommodation in a middle class colony even in a metropolitan city. People 
often harbour prejudices about other social groups.  Each of us grows up as 
a member of a community from which we acquire ideas not just about our 
‘community’, our ‘caste’ or ‘class’ our ‘gender’ but also about others.  Often 
these ideas reflect prejudices.

Prejudices refer to pre-conceived opinions or attitudes held by members 
of one group towards another.  The word literally means ‘pre-judgement’, that 
is, an opinion formed in advance of any familiarity with the subject, before 
considering any available evidence.  A prejudiced person’s preconceived 
views are often based on hearsay rather than on direct evidence, and are 
resistant to change even in the face of new information.  Prejudice may be 
either positive or negative.  Although the word is generally used for negative 
pre-judgements, it can also apply to favourable pre-judgement.  For example, 
a person may be prejudiced in favour of members of his/her own caste or 
group and – without any evidence – believe them to be superior to members 
of other castes or groups. 

Prejudices are often grounded in stereotypes, fixed and inflexible 
characterisations of a group of people. Stereotypes are often applied to 
ethnic and racial groups and to women.  In a country such as India, which 
was colonised for a long time, many of these stereotypes are partly colonial 
creations.  Some communities were characterised as ‘martial races’, some others 
as effeminate or cowardly, yet others as untrustworthy.  In both English and 
Indian fictional writings we often encounter an entire group of people classified 
as ‘lazy’ or ‘cunning’.  It may indeed be true that some individuals are sometimes 
lazy or cunning, brave or cowardly.  But such a general statement is true of 
individuals in every group.  Even for such individuals, it is not true all the time 
– the same individual may be both lazy and hardworking at different times. 
Stereotypes fix whole groups into single, homogenous categories; they refuse to 
recognise the variation across individuals and across contexts or across time. 
They treat an entire community as though it were a single person with a single 
all-encompassing trait or characteristic.

If prejudice describes attitudes and opinions, discrimination refers to 
actual behaviour towards another group or individual. Discrimination can 
be seen in practices that disqualify members of one group from opportunities 
open to others, as when a person is refused a job because of their gender or 
religion.  Discrimination can be very hard to prove because it may not be open 73
or  explicitly stated.  Discriminatory behaviour or practices may be presented 
as motivated by other, more justifiable, reasons rather than prejudice.  For

such as education, health, transportation, 

insurance, social security, banking and even access to the police or judiciary. 
Social exclusion is not accidental but systematic – it is the result of structural 
features of society.  

India like most societies has been marked by acute practices of social 
discrimination and exclusion. At different periods of history protest movements 
arose against caste, gender and religious discrimination. Yet prejudices remain 
and often, new ones emerge. Thus, legislation alone is unable to transform 
society or produce lasting social change.  A constant social campaign to change 
awareness and sensitivity is required to break them. 

You have already read about the impact of colonialism on Indian society. 
What discrimination and exclusion mean was brought home to even the most 
privileged Indians at the hands of the British colonial state.  Such experiences 
were, of course, common to the various socially discriminated groups such 
as women, dalits and other oppressed castes and tribes. Faced with the 
humiliation of colonial rule and simultaneously exposed to ideas of democracy 
and justice, many Indians initiated and participated in a large number of social 
reform movements. 

In this chapter we focus on four such groups who have suffered from serious 
social inequality and exclusion, namely Dalits or the ex-untouchable castes; 
adivasis or communities refered to as ‘tribal’; women, and the differently abled. 
We attempt to look at each of their stories of struggles and achievements in 
the following sections.

74 Apart from these four groups, there are two more groups included in this 
category like transgender and people of third gender group. Information about 
these groups are given in Box 5.1a.

5.2 Caste and tribe – systems Justifying and

   Perpetuating Inequality

The CasTe SysTem as a DiscriminaTory SysTem

The caste system is a distinct Indian social institution that legitimises and 
enforces practices of discrimination against people born into particular castes. 
These practices of discrimination are humiliating, exclusionary and exploitative. 

Historically, the caste system classified people by their occupation and 
status.  Every caste was associated with an occupation, which meant that 
persons born into a particular caste were also ‘born into’ the occupation 
associated with their caste – they had no choice.  Moreover, and perhaps 
more importantly, each caste also had a specific place in the hierarchy of 
social status, so that, roughly speaking, not only were occupational categories 
ranked by social status, but there could be a further ranking within each broad 
occupational category. In strict scriptural terms, social and economic status 
were supposed to be sharply separated.  For example, the ritually highest caste 
– the Brahmins – were not supposed to amass wealth, and were subordinated 
to the secular power of kings and rulers belonging to the Kshatriya castes.  On 
the other hand, despite having the highest secular status and power, the king 
was subordinated to the Brahmin in the ritual-religious sphere.  (Compare this 
to the ‘apartheid’ system described in Box 5.1b)

However, in actual historical practice economic and social status tended to 
coincide.  There was thus a fairly close correlation between social (i.e. caste) 75
status and economic status – the ‘high’ castes were almost invariably of high 
economic status, while the ‘low’ castes were almost always of low economic 

Reprint 2025-26



Ind ian Soc iety

status.  In modern times, and particularly since the nineteenth century, the 
link between caste and occupation has become much less rigid.  Ritual-religious 
prohibitions on occupational change are not easily imposed today, and it is 
easier than before to change one’s occupation. Moreover, compared to a hundred 
or fifty years ago, the correlation between caste and economic status is also 
weaker – rich and poor people are to be found in every caste.  But – and this is 
the key point – the caste-class correlation is still remarkably stable at the macro 
level.  As the system has become less rigid, the distinctions between castes 
of broadly similar social and economic status have weakened.  Yet, between 
different socio-economic groupings, the distinctions continue to be maintained. 

Although things have certainly changed, they have not changed much at the 
macro level – it is still true that the privileged (and high economic status) sections 
of society tend to be overwhelmingly ‘upper’ caste while the disadvantaged (and 
low economic status) sections are dominated by the so called ‘lower’ castes. 
Moreover, the proportion of population that lives in poverty or affluence differs 
greatly across caste groups. (See Tables 1 and 2)  In short, even though there 
have been major changes brought about by social movements over more than a 
century, and despite changed modes of production as well as concerted attempts 
by the state to suppress its public role in independent India, caste continues 
to affect the life chances of Indians in the twenty-first century.

untouchAbility

‘Untouchability’ is an extreme and particularly vicious aspect of the caste system 
that prescribes stringent social sanctions against members of castes located at 
the bottom of the purity-pollution scale.  Strictly speaking, the ‘untouchable’ 
castes are outside the caste hierarchy – they are considered to be so ‘impure’

that their mere touch severely pollutes members of all other castes, bringing 
terrible punishment for the former and forcing the latter to perform elaborate 
purification rituals. In fact, notions of ‘distance pollution’ existed in many 
regions of India (particularly in the south) such that even the mere presence 
or the shadow of an ‘untouchable’ person is considered polluting.  Despite the 
limited literal meaning of the word, the institution of ‘untouchability’ refers not 
just to the avoidance or prohibition of physical contact but to a much broader 
set of social sanctions.

It is important to emphasise that the three main dimensions of 
untouchability – namely, exclusion, humiliation-subordination and exploitation 
– are all equally important in defining the phenomenon.  Although other (i.e., 
‘touchable’) low castes are also subjected to subordination and exploitation 
to some degree, they do not suffer the extreme forms of exclusion reserved 
for ‘untouchables.’  Dalits experience forms of exclusion that are unique 
and not practised against other groups – for instance, being prohibited from 
sharing drinking water sources or participating in collective religious worship, 
social ceremonies and festivals.  Moreover, untouchability is almost always 
associated with economic exploitation of various kinds, most commonly 
through the imposition of forced, unpaid (or under-paid) labour, or the 
confiscation of property.  Finally, untouchability is a pan-Indian phenomenon, 
although its specific forms and intensity vary considerably across regions and 
socio-historical contexts.

The so-called ‘untouchables’ have been referred to collectively by many 
names over the centuries. Whatever the specific etymology of these names, 
they are all derogatory and carry a strongly pejorative charge.  In fact, many of 
them continue to be used as forms of abuse even today, although their use is 
now a criminal offence.  Mahatma Gandhi had popularised the term ‘Harijan’ 79
(literally, children of God) in the 1930s to counter the pejorative charge carried 
by caste names.

However, the ex-untouchable communities and their leaders have coined 
another term, ‘Dalit’, which is now the generally accepted term for referring to 
these groups.  In Indian languages, the term Dalit literally means ‘downtrodden’ 
and conveys the sense of an oppressed people.  Though it was neither coined 
by Dr. Ambedkar nor frequently used by him, the term certainly resonates with 
his philosophy and the movement for empowerment that he led. It received 
wide currency during the caste riots in Mumbai in the early 1970s.  The Dalit 
Panthers, a radical group that emerged in western India during that time, used 
the term to assert their identity as part of their struggle for rights and dignity.

StAte And non-StAte initiAtiveS AddreSSinG cASte  
And tribe diScriminAtion 

The Indian state has had special programmes for the Scheduled Tribes and 
Scheduled Castes since even before Independence.  The ‘Schedules’ listing the 
castes and tribes recognised as deserving of special treatment because of the 
massive discrimination practiced against them were drawn up in 1935, by the 
British Indian government. After Independence, the same policies have been 
continued and many new ones added.  Among the most significant additions 
is the extension of special programmes to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) 
since the early 1990s.

The most important state initiative attempting to compensate for past and 
present caste discrimination is the one popularly known as ‘reservations’.  This 
involves the setting aside of some places or ‘seats’ for members of the Scheduled 
Castes and Tribes in different spheres of public life.  These include reservation of 
seats in the State and Central legislatures (i.e., state assemblies, Lok Sabha and 
Rajya Sabha); reservation of jobs in government service across all departments 
and public sector companies; and reservation of seats in educational 
institutions. The proportion of reserved seats is equal to the percentage share 
of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes in the total population.  But for the OBCs 
this proportion is decided differently. The same principle is extended to other 
developmental programmes of the government, some of which are exclusively 
for the Scheduled Castes or Tribes, while others give them preference.    

In addition to reservations, there have been a number of laws passed to 
end, prohibit and punish caste discrimination, specially untouchability.  One 
of the earliest such laws was the Caste Disabilities Removal Act of 1850, 
which disallowed the curtailment of rights of citizens due solely to change of 
religion or caste.  The most recent such law was the Constitution Amendment 
(Ninety Third Amendment) Act of 2005, which became law on 23rd January 
2006.  Coincidentally, both the 1850 law and the 2006 amendment related to 
education.  The 93rd Amendment is for introducing reservation for the Other 

80 80 Backward Classes in institutions of higher education, while the 1850 Act was 
used to allow entry of Dalits to government schools.  In between, there have been 
numerous laws, of which the important ones are, of course, the Constitution of

against very heavy odds – to struggle for justice and 
dignity. Dalits too have been increasingly active on 
the political, agitational, and cultural fronts. From the 
pre-Independence struggles and movements launched 
by people like Jyotiba Phule, Iyotheedas, Periyar, 
Ambedkar and others (See Chapter 3) to contemporary 
political organisations like the Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh  or the 
Dalit Sangharsh Samiti of Karnataka, Dalit political assertion has come a long 
way. Dalits have also made significant contributions to literature in several 
Indian languages, specially Marathi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. (See 
Box 5.4 which features a short poem by the well known Marathi Dalit poet, 
Daya Pawar.)

The OTher Backward classes

Untouchability was the most visible and comprehensive form of social 
discrimination. However, there were a large group of castes that were of low 
status and were also subjected to varying levels of discrimination short of 
untouchability. These were the service and artisanal castes who occupied 
the lower rungs of the caste hierarchy.  The Constitution of India recognises 
the possibility that there may be groups other than the Scheduled Tribes and 
Scheduled Castes who suffer from social disadvantages.  These groups – which 
need not be based on caste alone, but generally are identified by caste – were 
described as the ‘socially and educationally backward classes’. This is the 81
constitutional basis of the popular term ‘Other Backward Classes’ (OBCs), 
which is in common use today.

The City Box 5.2 Chapter 3), the OBCs are defined 
by Daya  Pawar negatively, by what they are not.  They

Seems like the Stone Age in the twentieth c entury. 

For these reasons, the OBCs are 
a much more diverse group than the 
Dalits or adivasis.  The first government 

of independent India under Jawaharlal Nehru appointed a commission to 
look into measures for the welfare of the OBCs.  The First Backward Classes 
Commission headed by Kaka Kalelkar submitted its report in 1953.  But the 
political climate at the time led to the report being sidelined.  From the mid-
fifties, the OBC issue became a regional affair pursued at the state rather than 
the central level.  

The southern states had a long history of backward caste political agitation 
that had started in the early twentieth century.  Because of these powerful social 
movements, policies to address the problems of the OBCs were in place long 
before they were discussed in most northern states.  The OBC issue returned 
to the central level in the late 1970s after the Emergency when the Janata 
Party came to power. The Second Backward Classes Commission headed by 
B.P. Mandal was appointed at this time.  However, it was only in 1990, when the 
central government decided to implement the ten-year old Mandal Commission 
report, that the OBC issue became a major one in national politics.

Since the 1990s we have seen the resurgence of lower caste movements in 
north India, among both the OBCs and Dalits.  The politicisation of the OBCs 
allows them to convert their large numbers – recent surveys show that they are 
about 41% of the national population – into political influence.  This was not 
possible at the national level before, as shown by the sidelining of the Kalelkar 
Commission report, and the neglect of the Mandal Commission report.

The large disparities between the upper OBCs (who are largely landed castes 
and enjoy dominance in rural society in many regions of India) and the lower 
OBCs (who are very poor and disadvantaged, and are often not very different 

82 from Dalits in socio-economic terms) make this a difficult political category to 
work with.  However, the OBCs are severely under-represented in all spheres 

Reprint 2025-26

except landholding and political representation (they have a large number of 
MLAs and MPs).  Although the upper OBCs are dominant in the rural sector, 
the situation of urban OBCs is much worse, being much closer to that of the 
Scheduled Castes and Tribes than to the upper castes.

AdivAsi struggles

Like the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes are also social groups 
that are duly recognised by the Constitution of India. The jana or tribes were 
believed to be ‘people of the forest’ whose distinctive habitat in the hill and 
forest areas shaped their economic, social and political attributes.  However, 
ecological isolation was nowhere absolute. Tribal groups have had long and close 
association with Hindu society and culture, making the boundaries between 
‘tribe’ and ‘caste’ quite porous.  (Recall the discussion of the concept of tribe 
in Chapter 3). 

In the case of adivasis, the movement of populations from one area to 
another further complicates the picture.  Today, barring the North-Eastern 
states, there are no areas of the country that are inhabited exclusively by tribal 
people; there are only areas of tribal concentration.  Since the middle of the 
nineteenth century, non-tribals have moved into the tribal districts of central 
India, while tribal people from the same districts have migrated to plantations, 
mines, factories and other places of employment.   

In the areas where tribal populations are concentrated, their economic 
and social conditions are usually much worse than those of non-tribals. The 
impoverished and exploited circumstances under which adivasis live can be 
traced historically to the pattern of accelerated resource extraction started by the 
colonial British government and continued by the government of independent 
India.  From the late nineteenth century onwards, the colonial government 
reserved most forest tracts for its own use, severing the rights that adivasis 
had long exercised to use the forest for gathering produce and for shifting 
cultivation.  Forests were now to be protected for maximising timber production. 
With this policy, the mainstay of their livelihoods was taken away from adivasis, 
rendering their lives poorer and more insecure. Denied access to forests and 
land for cultivation, adivasis were forced to either use the forests illegally (and 
be harassed and prosecuted as ‘encroachers’ and thieves) or migrate in search 
of wage labour.  

After the Independence of India in 1947 the government’s monopoly over 
forests continued. The policy of capital-intensive industrialisation adopted by the 
Indian government required mineral resources and power-generation capacities 
which were concentrated in Adivasi areas.  Adivasi lands were rapidly acquired 
for new mining and dam projects. In the process, millions of adivasis were 
displaced without any appropriate compensation or rehabilitation.  Justified 83
in the name of ‘national development’ and ‘economic growth’, these policies

were also a form of internal colonialism, subjugating adivasis and alienating 
the resources upon which they depended. Projects such as the Sardar Sarovar 
dam on the river Narmada in Western India and the Polavaram dam on the river 
Godavari in Andhra Pradesh displaced hundreds of thousands of adivasis from 
their original habitats. These processes continue to prevail and have become 
even more powerful since the 1990s when economic liberalisation policies were 
officially adopted by the Indian government. It is now easier for corporate firms 
to acquire large areas of land by displacing adivasis.

Like the term Dalit, the term Adivasi connotes political awareness and 
the assertion of rights.  Literally meaning ‘original inhabitants’, the term 
was coined in the 1930s as part of the struggle against the intrusion by the 
colonial government and outside settlers and moneylenders.  Being Adivasi is 
about shared experiences of the loss of forests, the alienation of land, repeated 
displacements since Independence in the name of ‘development projects’ and 
much more.

In spite of the heavy odds against them and in the face of their marginalisation 
many tribal groups have been waging struggles against outsiders (called ‘dikus’) 
and the state.  In post-Independence India, the most significant achievements 
of Adivasi movements include the attainment of statehood for Jharkhand 
and Chattisgarh, which were originally part of Bihar and Madhya Pradesh 
respectively.  In this respect adivasis and their struggles are different from the 
Dalit struggle because, unlike Dalits, adivasis were concentrated in contiguous 
areas and could demand states of their own. 

 5.3 Struggle for Women’S Equality and RightS

Because of the obvious biological and physical differences between men 
and women, gender inequality is often treated as natural.  However, despite 
appearances, scholars have shown that the inequalities between men and 
women are social rather than natural. For example, there are no biological 
reasons that can explain why so few women are found in positions of public 
power.  Nor can nature explain why women generally receive a smaller or no 
share in family property in most societies.  But the strongest argument comes 
from the societies that were different from the ‘normal’ or common pattern. 
If women were biologically unfit to be inheritors and heads of families, how 
did matrilineal societies (as the Nairs of Kerala used to be, and as the Khasis 
of Meghalaya still are) work for centuries?  How have women managed to be 
successful farmers and traders in so many African societies?  There is, in 
short, nothing biological about the inequalities that mark the relations between 
women and men. Gender is thus also a form of social inequality and exclusion 
like caste and class, but with its own specific features.  In this section we will 

85
look at how gender inequality came to be recognised as inequality in the Indian 
context, and the kinds of responses that this recognition produced.

The women’s question arose in modern India as part of the nineteenth 
century middle class social reform movements. The nature of these movements 
varied from region to region. They are often termed as middle class reform 
movements because many of these reformers were from the newly emerging 
western educated Indian middle class. They were often at once inspired by 
the democratic ideals of the modern west and by a deep pride in their own 
democratic traditions of the past. Many used both these resources to fight for 
women’s rights. We can only give illustrative examples here. We draw from 
the anti-sati campaign led by Raja Rammohun Roy in Bengal, the widow 
remarriage movement in the Bombay Presidency where Ranade was one of 
the leading reformers, from Jyotiba Phule’s simultaneous attack on caste and 
gender oppression, and from the social reform movement in Islam led by Sir 
Syed Ahmed Khan.  

Raja Rammohun Roy’s attempts to reform society, religion and the status 
of women can be taken as the starting point of nineteenth century social 
reform in Bengal. A decade before establishing the Brahmo Samaj in 1828, Roy 
undertook the campaign against “sati” which was the first women’s issue to 
receive public attention. Rammohun Roy’s ideas represented a curious mixture 
of Western rationality and an assertion of Indian traditionality. Both trends can 
be located in the overarching context of a response to colonialism. Rammohun 
thus attacked the practice of sati on the basis of both appeals to humanitarian 
and natural rights doctrines as well as Hindu shastras.

5.4 the struggles of the dIsabled

The differently abled are not ‘disabled’ only because they are physically or 
mentally ‘impaired’ but also because society is built in a manner that does 
not cater to their needs.  In contrast to the struggles over Dalit, adivasi or 
women’s rights, the rights of the disabled have been recognised only very 
recently. Yet in all historical periods, in all societies there have been people 
who are disabled.  One of the leading activists and scholars of disability in 
the Indian context, Anita Ghai, argues that this invisibility of the disabled 
can be compared to the Invisible Man of Ralph Ellison.  Ellison’s novel of 
that name is a famous indictment of racism against African Americans in 
the USA. 

I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the 
bodiless heads you see sometimes in the circus sideshows, it is as though I 
have been surrounded by mirrors of hard distorting glass. When they approach 
me they see only my surroundings, themselves, figments of their imagination. 
Indeed everything and anything except me (Ellison, 1952:3). 89

The very term ‘disabled’ is significant because it draws attention to the fact 
that public perception of the ‘disabled’ needs to be questioned.

The roots of such attitudes lie in the cultural conception that 
views an impaired body as a result of fate.  Destiny is seen 

as the culprit, and disabled people are the victims. The common perception 
views disability as retribution for past karma (actions) from which there can 
be no reprieve. The dominant cultural construction in India therefore looks at 

disability as essentially a characteristic of the individual.

poverty by increasing isolation and economic strain, not just for the individual 
but for the family; there is little doubt that disabled people are among the 
poorest in poor countries.

Significantly, efforts to redress the situation have come from the disabled 
themselves. The government has had to respond as the notification in Box 5.8 
shows. 

It is only recently with the efforts of the disabled themselves that some 
awareness is building in the society on the need to rethink ‘disability’.  This is 
illustrated by the newspaper report on the next page.

Recognition of disability is absent from the wider educational discourse. 
This is evident from the historical practices within the educational system that

the Indian context, caste, tribe and gender are now getting the attention they

as those who are marginalised by religion or by a combination of categories. 
More complex formations like groups defined by religion and caste, gender

D ifferent kinds of social institutions, ranging from the family to the market, 
can bring people together, create strong collective identities and strengthen 
social cohesion, as you learnt in chapters 3 and 4. But, on the other hand, 
as chapters 4 and 5 showed, the very same institutions can also be sources 
of inequality and exclusion. In this chapter, you will learn about some of the 
tensions and difficulties associated with cultural diversity. What precisely does 
‘cultural diversity’ mean, and why is it seen as a challenge? 

The term ‘diversity’ emphasises differences rather than inequalities. When 
we say that India is a nation of great cultural diversity, we mean that there are 
many different types of social groups and communities living here. These are 
communities defined by cultural markers such as language, religion, sect, race 
or caste. When these diverse communities are also part of a larger entity like a 
nation, then difficulties may be created by competition or conflict between them. 

This is why cultural diversity can present tough challenges. The 
difficulties arise from the fact that cultural identities are very powerful – they 
can arouse intense passions and are often able to moblise large numbers 
of people. Sometimes cultural differences are accompanied by economic 
and social inequalities, and this further complicates things. Measures to 
address the inequalities or injustices suffered by one community can provoke 
opposition from other communities. The situation is made worse when scarce 
resources – like river waters, jobs or government funds – have to be shared. 

6.1 The ImporTance of communITy IdenTITy

Every human being needs a sense of stable identity to operate in this world. 
Questions like — Who am I? How am I different from others? How do others 
understand and comprehend me? What goals and aspirations should I have? – 
constantly crop up in our life right from childhood. We are able to answer many 
of these questions because of the way in which we are socialised, or taught 
how to live in society by our immediate families and our community in various 
senses. (Recall the discussion of socialisation in your Class XI textbooks.) The 
socialisation process involves a continuous dialogue, negotiation and even 
struggle against significant others (those directly involved in our lives) like our 
parents, family, kin group and our community. Our community provides us 
the language (our mother tongue) and the cultural values through which we 
comprehend the world. It also anchors our self-identity. 

Community identity is based on birth and ‘belonging’ rather than on some 
form of acquired qualifications or ‘accomplishment’. It is what we ‘are’ rather 
than what we have ‘become’. We don’t have to do anything to be born into a 

98 community – in fact, no one has any choice about which family or community or 
country they are born into. These kinds of identities are called ‘ascriptive’ – that 
is, they are determined by the birth and do not involve any choice on the part of 
the individuals concerned. It is an odd fact of social life that people feel a deep

The Cha llenges of Cultura l Diversity

sense of security and satisfaction in belonging to communities in which their 
membership is entirely accidental. We often identify so strongly with communities 
we have done noting to ‘deserve’ - passed no exam, demonstrated no skill or 
competence... This is very unlike belonging to, say, a profession or team. Doctors 
or architects have to pass exams and demonstrate their competence. Even in 
sports, a certain level of skill and performance are a necessary pre-condition 
for membership in a team. But our membership in our families or religious or 
regional communities is without preconditions, and yet it is total. In fact, most 
ascriptive identities are very hard to shake off; even if we choose to disown them, 
others may continue to identify us by those very markers of belonging.

Perhaps it is because of this accidental, unconditional and yet almost 
inescapable belonging that we can often be so emotionally attached to our 
community identity. Expanding and overlapping circles of community ties 
(family, kinship, caste, ethnicity, language, region or religion) give meaning to 
our world and give us a sense of identity, of who we are. That is why people 
often react emotionally or even violently whenever there is a perceived threat 
to their community identity. 

A second feature of ascriptive identities and community feeling is that they 
are universal. Everyone has a motherland, a mother tongue, a family, a faith… 
This may not necessarily be strictly true of every individual, but it is true in 
a general sense. And we are all equally committed and loyal to our respective 
identities. Once again it is possible to come across people who may not be 
particularly committed to one or the other aspect of their identity. But the 
possibility of this commitment is potentially available to most people. Because 
of this, conflicts that involve our communities (whether of nation, language, 
religion, caste or region) are very hard to deal with. Each side in the conflict 
thinks of the other side as a hated enemy, and there is a tendency to exaggerate 
the virtues of one’s own side as well as the vices of the other side. Thus, when 
two nations are at war, patriots in each nation see the other as the enemy 
aggressor; each side believes that God and truth are on their side. In the heat 
of the moment, it is very hard for people on either side to see that they are 
constructing matching but reversed mirror images of each other. 

Communities, nations and nation-states

At the simplest level, a nation is a sort of large-scale community – it is a 
community of communities. Members of a nation share the desire to be part of 
the same political collectivity. This desire for political unity usually expresses 
itself as the aspiration to form a state. In its most general sense, the term state 
refers to an abstract entity consisting of a set of political-legal institutions 
claiming control over a particular geographical territory and the people living 
in it. In Max Weber’s well-known definition, a state is a “body that successfully 
claims a monopoly of legitimate force in a particular territory” (Weber 1970:78). 

99
A nation is a peculiar sort of community that is easy to describe but hard to 

define. We know and can describe many specific nations founded on the basis 
of common cultural, historical and political institutions like a shared religion,

language, ethnicity, history or regional 
culture. But it is hard to come up with 
any defining features, any characteristics 
that a nation must possess. For every 
possible criterion there are exceptions and 
counter-examples. For example, there are 
many nations that do not share a single 
common language, religion, ethnicity and 
so on. On the other hand, there are many 
languages, religions or ethnicities that are 
shared across nations. But this does not 
lead to the formation of a single unified 
nation of, say, all English speakers or of 
all Buddhists. 

How, then, can we distinguish a nation from other kinds of communities, such 
as an ethnic group (based on common descent in addition to other commonalities 
of language or culture), a religious community, or a regionally-defined community? 
Conceptually, there seems to be no hard distinction – any of the other types of 
community can one day form a nation. Conversely, no particular kind of community 
can be guaranteed to form a nation. 

The criterion that comes closest to distinguishing a nation is the state. Unlike the 
other kinds of communities mentioned before, nations are communities that have 
a state of their own. That is why the two are joined with a hyphen to form the term 
nation-state. Generally speaking, in recent times there has been a one-to-one bond 
between nation and state (one nation, one state; one state, one nation). But this is 
a new development. It was not true in the past that a single state could represent 
only one nation, or that every nation must have its own state. For example, 
when it was in existence, the Soviet Union explicitly recognised that the peoples 
it governed were of different ‘nations’ and more than one hundred such internal 
nationalities were recognised. Similarly, people constituting a nation may actually 
be citizens or residents of different states. For example, there are more Jamaicans 
living outside Jamaica than in Jamaica – that is, the population of ‘non-resident’ 
Jamaicans exceeds that of ‘resident’ Jamaicans. A different example is provided 
by ‘dual citizenship’ laws. These laws allow citizens of a particular state to also – 
simultaneously – be citizens of another state. Thus, to cite one instance, Jewish 
Americans may be citizens of Israel as well as the USA; they can even serve in the 
armed forces of one country without losing their citizenship in the other country.

In short, today it is hard to define a nation in any way other than to say that it 
is a community that has succeeded in acquiring a state of its own. Interestingly, 
the opposite has also become increasingly true. Just as would-be or aspiring 
nationalities are now more and more likely to work towards forming a state, 

100 existing states are also finding it more and more necessary to claim that they 
represent a nation. One of the characteristic features of the modern era (recall the 
discussion of modernity from Chapter 4 of your Class XI textbook, Understanding 
Society) is the establishment of democracy and nationalism as dominant sources

of political legitimacy. This means that, today, ‘the nation’ is the most accepted 
or proper justification for a state, while ‘the people’ are the ultimate source of 
legitimacy of the nation. In other words, states ‘need’ the nation as much or even 
more than nations need states.

But as we have seen in the preceding paragraphs, there is no historically fixed 
or logically necessary relationship between a nation-state and the varied forms of 
community that it could be based on. This means that there is no pre-determined 
answer to the question: How should the ‘state’ part of the nation-state treat the 
different kinds of community that make up the ‘nation’ part? As is shown in

might a lso feel a strong sense of identity with their community – ethnic , relig ious, linguistic  and so on.

of 2004 on Culture and Democracy), most states have generally been suspicious 
of cultural us cultural diversity and have tried to reduce or eliminate it. However, 
there are many successful examples – including India – which show that it is 
perfectly possible to have a strong nation-state without having to ‘homogenise’ 
different types of community identities into one standard type. 

Box 6.1 speaks of ‘assimilationist’ and ‘integrationist’ policies. Policies 
that promote assimilation are aimed at persuading, encouraging or forcing all 
citizens to adopt a uniform set of cultural values and norms. These values and 
norms are usually entirely or largely those of the dominant social group. Other, 
non-dominant or subordinated groups in society are expected or required to give 
up their own cultural values and adopt the prescribed ones. Policies promoting 
integration are different in style but not in overall objective: they insist that the 
public culture be restricted to a common national pattern, while all ‘non-national’ 
cultures are to be relegated to the private sphere. In this case too, there is the 
danger of the dominant group’s culture being treated as ‘national’ culture. 

You can probably see what the problem is by now. There is no necessary 
relationship between any specific form of community and the modern form 
of the state. Any of the many bases of community identity (like language, 
religion, ethnicity and so on) may or may not lead to nation formation – there 
are no guarantees. But because community identities can act as the basis for 
nation-formation, already existing states see all forms of community identity as 
dangerous rivals. That is why states generally tend to favour a single, homogenous 
national identity, in the hope of being able to control and manage it. However, 
suppressing cultural diversity can be very costly in terms of the alienation of 
the minority or subordinated communities whose culture is treated as ‘non-
national’. Moreover, the very act of suppression can provoke the opposite effect 
of intensifying community identity. So encouraging, or at least allowing, cultural 
diversity is good policy from both the practical and the principled point of view. 

Cultural Diversity and india as a Nation-state

The Indian nation-state is socially and culturally one of the most diverse 
countries of the world. It has a population of about 1.21 billion people, according 
to Census of India 2011, currently the second largest – and soon to become 
the largest – national population in the world. These billion-plus people speak 
about 1,632 different languages and dialects. As many as twenty two of these 
languages have been officially recognised and placed under the 8th Schedule 
of the Constitution, thus guaranteeing their legal status. In terms of religion, 
about 80% of the population are Hindus, who in turn are regionally specific, 
plural in beliefs and practices, and divided by castes and languages. About 
14.2% of the population are Muslims, which makes India the world’s second 

102 largest Muslim country after Indonesia and Pakistan. The other major religious 
communities are Christians (2.3%), Sikhs (1.7%), Buddhists (0.7%) and Jains 
(0.4%). Because of India’s huge population, these small percentages can also 
add up to large absolute numbers.

The Cha llenges of Cultura l Diversity

In terms of the nation-state’s relationship with community identities, 
the Indian case fits neither the assimilationist nor the integrationist model 
described in Box 6.1. From its very beginning the independent Indian state has 
ruled out an assimilationist model. However, the demand for such a model has 
been expressed by some sections of the dominant Hindu community. Although 
‘national integration’ is a constant theme in state policy, India has not been 
‘integrationist’ in the way that Box 6.1 describes. The Constitution declares the 
state to be a secular state, but religion, language and other such factors are not 
banished from the public sphere. In fact these communities have been explicitly

key fac tors in consolida ting and deepening democ rac ies and build ing enduring “ sta te-nations” . 

 Ind ia ’s constitution incorpora tes this notion. Although Ind ia  is cultura lly d iverse, comparative

recognised by the state. By international standards, very strong constitutional 
protection is offered to minority religions. In general, India’s problems have been 
more in the sphere of implementation and practice rather than laws or principles. 
But on the whole, India can be considered a good example of a ‘state-nation’ 
though it is not entirely free from the problems common to nation-states. 

6.2 Regionalism in the indian Context 

Regionalism in India is rooted in India’s diversity of languages, cultures, tribes, 
and religions. It is also encouraged by the geographical concentration of these 
identity markers in particular regions, and fuelled by a sense of regional 
deprivation. Indian federalism has been a means of accommodating these 
regional sentiments (Bhattacharyya 2005).

After Independence, initially the Indian state continued with the British-
Indian arrangement dividing India into large provinces, also called ‘presidencies’. 
(Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta were the three major presidencies; incidentally, 
all three cities after which the presidencies were named have changed their 
names recently). These were large multi-ethnic and multilingual provincial states 
constituting the major political-administrative units of a semi-federal state called 
the Union of India. Soon after the adoption of the Constitution, all these units 
of the colonial era had to be reorganised into ethno-linguistic States within the 
Indian union in response to strong popular agitations. (See Box 6.3.)

Adapted from an article by Ramachandra Guha in the Times of India, 1 November 2006.

Language coupled with regional and tribal identity  and not religion  has 
therefore provided the most powerful instrument for the formation of ethno-
national identity in India. However, this does not mean that all linguistic 
communities have got statehood. For instance, in the creation of three new 
states in 2000, namely Chhatisgarh, Uttaranchal and Jharkhand, language 
did not play a prominent role. Rather, a combination of ethnicity based on 
tribal identity, language, regional deprivation and ecology provided the basis

for intense regionalism resulting in statehood. Currently there are 28 States 105
(federal units) and 8 Union territories (centrally administered) within the Indian 
nation-state.

Respecting regional sentiments is not just a matter of creating States: this 
has to be backed up with an institutional structure that ensures their viability 
as relatively autonomous units within a larger federal structure. In India this 
is done by Constitutional provisions defining the powers of the States and 
the Centre. There are lists of ‘subjects’ or areas of governance which are the 
exclusive responsibility of either State or Centre, along with a ‘Concurrent List’ 
of areas where both are allowed to operate. The State legislatures determine 
the composition of the upper house of Parliament, the Rajya Sabha. In addition 
there are periodic committees and commissions that decide on Centre-State

To be effective, the ideas of inclusive 
nationalism had to be built into the 
Constitution. For, as already discussed 
(in section 6.1), there is a very strong 
tendency for the dominant group to assume 
that their culture, language or religion is 
synonymous with the nation state. However, 
for a strong and democratic nation, special 
constitutional provisions are required to 
ensure the rights of all groups and those 
of minority groups in particular. A brief A Kashmiri g irl
discussion on the definition of minorities will 
enable us to appreciate the importance of safeguarding minority 
rights for a strong, united and democratic nation.

The notion of minority groups is widely used in sociology and 
is more than a merely numerical distinction – it usually involves 
some sense of relative disadvantage. Thus, privileged minorities 
such as extremely wealthy people are not usually referred to as 
minorities; if they are, the term is qualified in some way, as in 
the phrase ‘privileged minority’. When minority is used without 
qualification, it generally implies a relatively small but also 
disadvantaged group. The sociological sense of minority also 
implies that the members of the minority form a collectivity – that 
is, they have a strong sense of group solidarity, a feeling of 
togetherness and belonging. This is linked to disadvantage 
because the experience of being subjected to prejudice and 
discrimination usually heightens feelings of intra-group loyalty 
and interests (Giddens 2001:248). Thus, groups that may be 
minorities in a statistical sense, such as people who are left-
handed or people born on 29th February, are not minorities in 
the sociological sense because they do not form a collectivity.

However, it is possible to have anomalous instances where a minority group 
is disadvantaged in one sense but not in another. Thus, for example, religious 
minorities like the Parsis or Sikhs may be relatively well-off economically. But 
they may still be disadvantaged in a cultural sense because of their small 
numbers relative to the overwhelming majority of Hindus. Religious or cultural 
minorities need special protection because of the demographic dominance of 
the majority. 

Relative size and distribution of relig ious minorities
Box 6.5

As is well known, Hindus c onstitute an overwhelming ma jority in Ind ia : they number 
about 966 millions and account for 80% of the total population according to the 
2011 Census.  The Hindu population is four times la rger than the c omb ined  popula tion of a ll 
other minority relig ions, and  about six times la rger than the la rgest minority group , the Muslims. 

However, this can also be misleading because Hindus are not a homogenous group and are divided  
by caste – as indeed are all the other major religions, albeit to different extent.

The Muslims are by far the largest religious minority in India – they numbered 172 millions and were 
14.2% of the population in 2011. They are scattered all over the country, constitute a majority in 
Jammu and Kashmir and have sizeable pockets in West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Andhra 
Pradesh, Karna taka  and  Ra jasthan. 

Christians constitute around 2.3% of the population (27.8 million) and are scattered all over, with 
sizeab le poc kets in the north eastern and  southern sta tes. The three Christian-ma jority sta tes 
are all in the North East – Nagaland (88%), Mizoram (87%) and Meghalaya (74%).  Sizeable 
proportions of Christians are also found in Goa (25%) and Kerala (18.4%). 
The Sikhs constitute 1.7% of the population (21 million) and although they are found scattered 
across the country, they are concentrated in Punjab where they are in a majority (58%). 
There are also several other small religious groups – Buddhists (8 million, 0.7%), Jains 
(4.5 million, 0.4%), and ‘Other Religions and Persuasions’ (under 8 million, 0.7%).  The highest 
proportion of Buddhists is found in Sikkim (27%) and Arunachal Pradesh (12%), while among the 
larger states Maharashtra has the highest share of Buddhists at 6%. The highest concentrations 
of Jains are found in Maharashtra (1.3%), Delhi and Gujarat nearly 1 per cent each.

In the long years of struggle against British colonialism, Indian nationalists 
understood the imperative need to recognise and respect India’s diversity. Indeed 
‘unity in diversity’ became a short hand to capture the plural and diverse nature 
of Indian society. Discussions on minority and cultural rights mark many of 
the deliberations of the Indian National Congress and find final expression in 
the Indian Constitution (Zaidi 1984).

The makers of the Indian Constitution were aware that a strong and united 
nation could be built only when all sections of people had the freedom to practice 
their religion, and to develop their culture and language. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, 
the chief architect of the Constitution, made this point clear in the Constituent 
Assembly, as shown in Box 6.7. 109

Communalism, seCularism and the nation-state

Communalism

In everyday language, the word ‘communalism’ refers to aggressive chauvinism 
based on religious identity. Chauvinism itself is an attitude that sees one’s 
own group as the only legitimate or worthy group, with other groups being 
seen – by definition – as inferior, illegitimate and opposed. Thus, to simplify 
further, communalism is an aggressive political ideology linked to religion. This 
is a peculiarly Indian, or perhaps South Asian, meaning that is different from 
the sense of the ordinary English word. In the English language, “communal” 
means something related to a community or collectivity as different from an 
individual. The English meaning is neutral, whereas the South Asian meaning 
is strongly charged. The charge may be seen as positive – if one is sympathetic 
to communalism – or negative, if one is opposed to it.

It is important to emphasise that communalism is about politics, not about 
religion. Although communalists are intensely involved with religion, there is 
in fact no necessary relationship between personal faith and communalism. A 
communalist may or may not be a devout person, and devout believers may or may 
not be communalists. However, all communalists do believe in a political identity 
based on religion. The key factor is the attitude towards those who believe in 
other kinds of identities, including other religion-based identities. Communalists 
cultivate an aggressive political identity, and are prepared to condemn or attack 
everyone who does not share their identity. 

One of the characteristic features of communalism is its claim that 
religious identity overrides everything else. Whether one is poor or rich, 
whatever one’s occupation, caste or political beliefs, it is religion alone that 
counts. All Hindus are the same as are all Muslims, Sikhs and so on. This 
has the effect of constructing large and diverse groups as singular and 
homogenous. 

Communalism is an especially important issue in India because it has been 
a recurrent source of tension and violence. India has had a history of communal 
riots from pre-Independence times, often as a result of the divide-and-rule 
policy adopted by the colonial rulers. But colonialism did not invent inter-
community conflicts – there is also a long history of pre-colonial conflicts – and 
it certainly cannot be blamed for post-Independence riots and killings. Indeed, 
if we wish to look for instances of religious, cultural, regional or ethnic conflict 
they can be found in almost every phase of our history. But we should not 
forget that we also have a long tradition of religious pluralism, ranging from 
peaceful co-existence to actual inter-mixing or syncretism. This syncretic 
heritage is clearly evident in the devotional songs and poetry of the Bhakti and 
Sufi movements (Box 6.9). In short, history provides us with both good and 
bad examples; what we wish to learn from it is up to us.

Secularism is among the most complex terms in social 
and political theory. In the western context the main Ta lk to  your p a rents a nd  the

The Indian meanings of secular and secularism linguistic  g roup s, reg ions a nd  
include the western sense but also involve others. The relig ions.
most common use of secular in everyday language is 
as the opposite of communal. So, a secular person or state is one that does not 
favour any particular religion over others. Secularism in this sense is the opposite 
of religious chauvinism and it need not necessarily imply hostility to religion as 
such. In terms of the state-religion relationship, this sense of secularism implies 
equal respect for all religions, rather than separation or distancing. For example, the 
secular Indian state declares public holidays to mark the festivals of all religions. 

Some complications have been created by the tension between the Indian 
state’s simultaneous commitment to secularism along with the protection of 
minorities. The protection of minorities requires that they be given special 
consideration in a context where the normal working of the political system places 
them at a disadvantage vis-à-vis the majority community. But providing such 
protection immediately invites the accusation of favouritism or ‘appeasement’ 
of minorities. Opponents argue that secularism of this sort is only an excuse to 
favour the minorities in return for their votes or other kinds of support. Supporters 
argue that without such special protection, secularism can turn into an excuse 
for imposing the majority community’s values and norms on the minorities.

6.4 sTaTe and cIvIl socIeTy

You may have noticed that much of this chapter has been concerned with 
the state. The state is indeed a very crucial institution when it comes to 
the management of cultural diversity in a nation. Although it claims to 
represent the nation, the state can also become somewhat independent

of the nation and its people. To the extent that the state structure – the 
legislature, bureaucracy, judiciary, armed forces, police and other arms of 
the state – becomes insulated from the people, it also has the potential of

turning authoritarian. An authoritarian state is the opposite of a democratic 
state. It is a state in which the people have no voice and those in power are 
not accountable to anyone. Authoritarian states often limit or abolish civil 
liberties like freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of political 
activity, right to protection from wrongful use of authority, right to the 
due processes of the law, and so on. Apart from authoritarianism, there 
is also the possibility that state institutions become unable or unwilling to 
respond to the needs of the people because of corruption, inefficiency, or 
lack of resources. In short, there are many reasons why a state may not be 
all that it should be. Non-state actors and institutions become important 
in this context, for they can keep a watch on the state, protest against its 
injustices or supplement its efforts. 

Civil society is the name given to the broad arena which lies beyond 
the private domain of the family, but outside the domain of both state and 
market. Civil society is the non-state and non-market part of the public 
domain in which individuals get together voluntarily to create institutions 
and organisations. It is the sphere of active citizenship: here, individuals take 
up social issues, try to influence the state or make demands on it, pursue 
their collective interests or seek support for a variety of causes. It consists

This chapter suggests some small practical research projects that you can 
try out. There is a big difference between reading about research and actually 
doing it. Practical experience of trying to answer a question and collecting 
evidence systematically is a very valuable experience. This experience will 
hopefully introduce you to the excitement and also some of the difficulties of 
sociological research. Before you read this chapter, please refer once again 
to Chapter 5 (“Doing Sociology: Research Methods”) in the Class XI textbook, 
Introducing Sociology.

The projects suggested here have tried to anticipate the potential problems 
of organising this kind of activity for large number of students in different 
kinds of schools located in different kinds of contexts. These are intended just 
to give you a feel for research. A “real” research project would obviously be 
more elaborate and involve much more time and effort than is possible in your 
setting. These are meant as suggestions; feel free to think up ideas of your own 
in consultation with your teachers. 

Every research question needs an appropriate or suitable research method. 
A given question may be answered with more than one method, but a given 
research method is not necessarily appropriate for all questions. In other 
words, for most research questions one has a choice of possible methods but 
this choice is usually limited. One of the first tasks of the researcher – after 
carefully specifying the research question – is to select a suitable method. This 
selection must be done not only according to technical criteria (i.e., the degree of 
compatibility between question and method), but also practical considerations. 
These latter might include the amount of time available to do the research; the 
resources available in terms of both people and materials; the circumstances 
or situations in which it has to be done, and so on.  

For example, let us suppose you are interested in comparing co-educational 
schools with ‘boys only’ or ‘girls only’ schools.  This, of course, is a broad topic. 
You must first formulate a specific question that you want to answer. Examples 
could be: Do students in co-educational schools do better in studies than 
students in boys/girls only schools?  Are boys only schools always better than 
co-educational schools in sports? Are children in single sex schools happier 
than children in co-educational schools, or some other such question.  Having 
decided on a specific question, the next step is to choose the appropriate method. 

For the last question, ‘Are school children in single sex schools happier?’, for 
example, you could choose to interview students of different kinds of schools. 
In the interview you could ask them directly how they felt about their school. 
You could then analyse the answers you collect to see if there is any difference 
between those who attend different kinds of schools. As an alternative, you 
could try to use a different method – say that of direct observation – to answer 

118 the research question. This means that you would have to spend time in 
co-educational and boys/girls schools, observing how students behave. You 
would have to decide on some criteria by which you could say if students are

more or less happy with their school. So, after observing different kinds of 
schools for sufficient time, you could hope to answer your question. A third 
method you could use is the survey method. This would involve preparing a 
questionnaire designed to get information on how students felt about their 
schools. You would then distribute the questionnaire to an equal number 
of students in each kind of school. You would then collect the filled-in 
questionnaires and analyse the results.

Here are some examples of some practical difficulties that you might face when 
doing research of this kind. Suppose you decide to do a survey. You must first 
make enough copies of the questionnaire. This involves time, effort and money. 
Next, you may need permission from teachers to distribute the questionnaire to 
students in their classrooms.  You may not get permission the first time, or you 
may be asked to come back later….. After you have distributed the questionnaire 
you may find that many people have not bothered to return it to you or have 
not answered all questions, or other such problems. You then have to decide 
how to deal with this – go back to your respondents and ask them to complete 
the questionnaires; or ignore the incomplete questionnaires and consider only 
the complete ones; consider only the completed answers, and so on. You must 
be prepared to deal with such problems during research work.

7.1 Variety of Methods  

You may remember the discussion of research methods in Chapter 5 of the 
Class XI textbook, Introducing Sociology. This may be a good time to revisit this 
chapter and refresh your memory.

Survey Method

A survey usually involves asking a relatively large number of people (such as 
30, 100, 2000, and so on; what is considered ‘large’ depends on the context 
and the kind of topic) the same fixed set of questions. The questions may be 
asked by an investigator in person where they are read out to the respondent, 
and his/her answers are noted down by the investigator. Or the questionnaire 
may be handed over to the respondents who then fill it up themselves and 
give it back. The main advantage of the survey is that it can cover a lot of 
people, so that the results are truly representative of the relevant group or 
population. The disadvantage is that the questions to be asked are already fixed. 
No on-the-spot adjustments are possible. So, if a question is misunderstood 
by the respondents, then wrong or misleading results can be produced. If a 
respondent says something interesting then this cannot be followed up with 
further questions on the subject because you have to stick to the questionnaire 
format. Moreover, questionnaires are like a snapshot taken at one particular 119
moment. The situation may change later or may have been different before, 
but the survey wouldn’t capture this.

IntervIewS

An interview is different from a survey in that it is always conducted in person and 
usually involves much fewer persons (as few as 5, 20, or 40, usually not much 
more than that). Interviews may be structured, that is, follow a pre-determined 
pattern of questions or unstructured, where only a set of topics is pre-decided, 
and the actual questions emerge as part of a conversation.  Interviews may be 
more or less intensive, in the sense that one may interview a person for a long 
time (2–3 hours) or in repeated visits to get a really detailed version of their story. 

Interviews have the advantage of being flexible in that promising topics may 
be pursued in greater detail, questions may be refined or modified along the way, 
and clarifications may be sought. The disadvantage of the interview method is 
that it cannot cover a large number of people and is limited to presenting the 
views of a select group of individuals.

obServatIon

Observation is a method where the researcher must systematically watch 
and record what is happening in whatever context or situation that has been 
chosen for the research. This sounds simple but may not always be easy to 
do in practice. Careful attention has to be paid to what is happening without 
pre-judging what is relevant to the study and what is not. Sometimes, what 
is not happening is as important or interesting as what does actually happen. 
For example, if your research question is about how different classes of people 
use specific open spaces, then it is significant that a given class or group of 
people (say poor people, or middle class people for example) never enter the 
space, or are never seen in it.

CoMbInatIonS of More than one Method

You can also try to combine methods to approach the same research question 
from different angles. In fact, this is often highly recommended. For example, if 
you are researching the changing place of mass media sources like newspapers 
and television in social life, you could combine a survey with archival methods. 
The survey will tell you about what is happening today, while the archival 
methods might tell you about what magazines, newspapers or television 
programmes were like in the past.

7.2 Possible theMes and subjects for sMall 

120  research Projects

Here are some suggestions about possible research topics; you can always 
choose other topics in consultation with your teachers.  Remember that these 

Reprint 2025-26



Suggestions for Projec t Work

are only topics – you need to select specific questions based on these topics. 
Remember also that most methods can be used with most of these topics, but 
that the specific question chosen must be suitable for the method chosen. You 
can also use combinations of methods. The topics are in no particular order. 
Topics that are not obviously or directly derived from your textbooks have been 
emphasised because it will be easier for you and your teachers to think of your 
own project related to the texts.

1. PublIC tranSPort 

What part does it play in people’s lives?  Who needs it?  Why do they need it? 
To what degree are different types of people dependent on public transport? 
What sorts of problems and issues are associated with public transport?  How 
have forms of public transport been changing over time? Does differential 
access to public transport cause social problems? Are there groups who do not 
need public transport? What is their attitude towards it? You could also take 
up the case of a particular form of transport – say the tonga, or the rickshaw, 
or the train – and write about its history in relation to your town or city. What 
are the changes this mode of transport has gone through? Who have been its 
main rivals? Is the competition with rivals being lost or won? For what reasons? 
What is the likely future of this mode of transport? Will anyone miss it?

If you live in Delhi, try to find out more about the Delhi Metro. Could you 
write a science-fiction like account of what the Metro would be like fifty years 
from now, in, say 2050 or 2060? (Remember, it is not easy to write good science 
fiction!  You must give reasons for the things you imagine; these future things 
must be related in some coherent fashion to things/relations/situations that 
exist in the present. So you would have to imagine how public transport will 
evolve given present conditions, and what the role of the Metro would be in 
future compared to what it is now.)

2. role of CoMMunICatIon MedIa In SoCIal lIfe

Communication media could include the mass media, like newspapers, 
television, films, internet and so on – i.e., media which convey information and 
are seen/accessed by large numbers of people. It could also include the media 
that people use for communicating with each other, such as the telephone, 
letters, mobile phones, email and internet. In these areas, you could try to 
investigate, for example, the changing place of mass media in social life and 
the shifts within major formats like print, radio, television, and so on. At a 
different level, you could try to ask a different sort of question about the likes 
and dislikes of particular groups (classes, age groups and genders) regarding 
films, books etc. How do people perceive the new communication media (like 
mobile phones, or internet) and their impact? What can we learn through 
observation and inquiry about their place in people’s lives?  Observation allows 
you to capture the divergence (if any) between stated views and actual behaviour. 
(How many hours do people really watch television, as different from how many 
hours they feel they watch, or feel is appropriate to watch etc..) What are some 
of the consequences of shift in format? (For example, has TV really reduced 
the importance of radio and newspapers, or does each format still have its own 
special niche?) What are the reasons why people prefer one or the other format? 

Alternatively, you could think of doing any number of projects based on a 
content analysis of the media (newspapers, magazines, television etc.) and how 

122 they have treated particular  themes or subjects, such as, for example, schools 
and school education, the environment, caste, religious conflicts, sports events, 
local versus national or regional news, etc.

This refers to all the devices used to do work in the household, such as gas, 
kerosene or other type of stoves; mixies, grinders and food processors of 
various kinds; the electric or other kind of iron for ironing clothes; washing 
machines; ovens; toaster; pressure cooker, and so on. How has work within 
the household changed over time? Has the coming of these devices changed 
the nature of work and specially the intra-household division of labour? Who 
are the people who use these devices? Are they mostly men or women, young 
or old,  paid or unpaid workers? How do the users feel about them? Have they 
really made work easier? Have there been any changes in the age-related jobs 
done within the household? (i.e., do younger/older people do different kinds 
of jobs now as compared to earlier?)

Alternatively, you could simply concentrate on how the domestic tasks are 123
distributed within the household – who does what, and whether there have 
been changes lately.

4. the uSe of PublIC SPaCe  

This research topic is about the different uses to which public space (such 
as an open field, the roadside or footpath, empty plots in housing colonies, 
space outside public offices, and the like) is put. For example, some spaces 
support a lot of small scale commercial activity like roadside vendors, small 
temporary shops and parking lots etc. Other spaces seem empty but get 
used in different ways – to hold marriage or religious functions, for public 
meetings, as a dumping ground for various kinds of things… Many spaces 
are occupied by poor homeless people and become in effect their homes. 
Try to think of research questions in this general area: What do people from 
different classes (e.g., the poor, middle classes, affluent people etc.) feel about 
the use of public space? What kind of a resource do they represent for these 

124 groups? How has the use of a particular open space in your neighbourhood 
been changing over time? Has it generated any conflicts or frictions? What 
are the reasons for this conflict?

5. Changing aspirations of Different age groups  

Did you always have the same ambitions throughout your life? Most people 
change their goals, specially at young ages. This research topic tries to discover 
what these changes are and whether there are any patterns to the changes 
across different groups. You could try choosing research groups such as 
different age groups (e.g., Classes V, VIII and XI) in different kinds of schools; 
different genders; different parental backgrounds, etc., and see if any patterns 
emerge.  You could also include adults in your research design and see what 
they remember about these sorts of changes, and whether there is any pattern 
to changes after school as compared to changes within the school-going age.

6. the ‘Biography’ of a CommoDity

Think of a particular consumption item in your own home, such as a television 
set, a motor cycle, a carpet or a piece of furniture. Try to imagine what the 
life-history of that commodity would be. Write about it as though you were 
that commodity and were writing an ‘autobiography’. What are the circuits 
of exchange through which it has moved to get to where it is now? Can you 
trace the social relations through which the item was produced, traded, and 
purchased?  What is its symbolic significance, for its owners – i.e. for you, your 
family, for the community?

If it could think and talk, what would your television set (or sofa set, or 125
motorcyle…) have to say about the people it meets or sees (like your family or 
other families or households that you can imagine)?

Glossary

Arithmetic progression: See ‘progression - arithmetic’ 

Assimilation: A process of cultural unification and homogenisation by which newly 
entering or subordinate groups lose their distinctive culture and adopt the 
culture of the dominant majority. Assimilation may be forced or voluntary, and 
usually remains incomplete or blocked where the subordinate or entering group 
is not accorded full membership on equal terms. For example, if an immigrant 
community is discriminated against by the dominant majority, and is not allowed to 
intermarry.

Authoritarianism: A system of government that does not derive its legitimacy from the 
people. Not a democratic or republican form of government. 

Birth Control: The use of techniques of contraception to prevent conception and birth. 
BPO (Business Process Outsourcing): A practice whereby a particular part of the 

production process or component of a service industry is contracted out to be 
performed by a third party. For example, a telephone company that provides 
phone lines and services, may outsource its customer service division, i.e., get 
another smaller company to handle all calls and complaints by customers. 

Capital: An accumulated fund of investible resources. Usually used for ‘active’ funds, i.e., 
funds that are not just being hoarded or saved, but are being held for investment. 
Capital seeks to grow, to add to itself – this is the process of accumulation. 

Capitalism:  A mode of production based on generalised commodity production, or 
a social system where (a) private property and the market have penetrated all 
sectors, converting everything including labour power into a saleable commodity; 
(b) two main classes exist – a mass of wage labourers who own nothing but their 
labour power (their capacity to perform labour), and a class of capitalists who, in 
order to survive as capitalists, must invest their capital and earn ever increasing 
profits in a competitive market economy.

Checks - positive: A term used by T.R. Malthus to refer to constraints on the rate of 
population growth that are imposed by nature regardless of the wishes of human 
beings. Examples of such checks include – famines, epidemics and other natural 
disasters.

Checks - preventive: A term used by T.R. Malthus to refer to constraints on the rate of 
population growth that are voluntarily imposed on themselves by human beings. 
Examples of such checks include – postponing marriage; and practicing celibacy 
or birth control. 

Civil Society: The sphere of society that lies beyond the family but is not part of either 
state or market. The arena of voluntary associations and organisations formed for 
cultural, social, religious or other non-commercial and non-state collective pursuits.

Class: An economic grouping based on common or similar position in the social relations 
of production, levels of income and wealth, life style and political preferences. 129

Colonialism: The ideology by which a country seeks to conquer and colonise (forcibly 
settle, rule over) another. The colony becomes a subordinate part of the 
coloniser’s country, and is exploited in various ways for the colonising country’s 
gain. Related to imperialism, but involves a more sustained interest in settling 
down to live in and govern the colony (i.e., exercising detailed and local control) 
rather than (as with imperialism) plundering and departing, or ruling from a 
distance.

Commodification (or commoditisation): The transformation of a non-commodity      
(i.e., something that is not bought and sold for money in a market) into a 
commodity.

Commodity: A good or service that may be bought or sold in the market.
Commodity fetishism: A condition under capitalism under which social relations become 

expressed as relations between things.
Communalism: Chauvinism based on religious identity. The belief that religion 

supersedes all other aspects of a person’s or group’s identity. Usually 
accompanied by an aggressive and hostile attitude towards persons and groups of 
other religious (or non-religious) identities.

Community: A general term for any disctinctive group whose members are connected 
to each other by consciously recognised commonalities and bonds of kinship, 
language, culture and so on. Belief in these commonalities is more important than 
actual proof of their existence. 

Consumption: Final use of goods and services by people who have purchased them 
(consumers).

Democracy: A form of government which derives its legitimacy from the people, and 
relies on explicit popular endorsement through elections or other method of 
ascertaining the people’s opinion.

Discourse: The framework of thinking in a particular area of social life. For instance, 
the discourse of criminality means how people in a given society think about 
criminality.

Discrimination: Practices, acts or activities resulting in the unjustified exclusion of the 
members of a particular group from access to goods, services, jobs, resources, 
etc., that are normally accessible to others. Discrimination has to be distinguished 
from prejudice, although the two are usually quite closely associated.

Diversity (Cultural Diversity): The presence within the larger national, regional or other 
context of many different kinds of cultural communities such as those defined by 
language, religion, region, ethnicity and so on. A multiplicity or plurality of identities.

Dominant Caste: A middle or upper-middle ranking caste with a large population and 
newly acquired land ownership rights. This combination makes these castes 
politically, economically and therefore socially dominant in the countryside in 

130 many regions of India. Dominant castes replace the older castes which exercised 
dominance; unlike these earlier castes, these are not ‘twice born’ castes (i.e., not 
from the brahmin, kshatriya or vaishya varnas.

Glossary

Economic anthropology: A subfield of socio-cultural anthropology that studies the entire 
range of economies and cultures found in the prehistoric, historic and ethnographic 
records, especially non-market economic systems.

Embedded:  (As in ‘socially embedded’) Existing within a larger context of society or 
culture which ‘frame’ or contextualise the process or phenomenon in question. 
To say that the economic institutions are embedded in society is to say that they 
exist within society and are able to function because of the background rules and 
arrangements made possible by society.

Endogamy: Requires an individual to marry within a culturally defined group of which he 
or she is already a member, as for example, caste.

Enumeration: Literally, ‘numbering’; refers to processes of counting and measurement, 
specially those relating to people, such as a census or survey.

Epidemic and Pandemic: Derived from the Greek (epi = upon; demos = the people). 
Refers to a sudden increase in the rate at which a disease affects the people of 
a given geographic area at a specific time. The key factor here is that the rate 
of incidence (the number of fresh cases reported per unit of time, such as a day, 
week, or month) has to be substantially higher than the ‘normal’ rate. This can be a 
partly subjective judgement. If a disease has a high but constant rate of incidence 
in a specific geographical area (i.e., there is no sudden increase) it is called an 
endemic disease. An epidemic that is not restricted to a given geographical area 
but is more widespread (i.e., it is at a national, international or even global level) is 
called a pandemic. 

Ethnic cleansing: The creation of ethnically homogenous territories through the mass 
expulsion of other ethnic populations. 

Ethnicity: An ethnic group is one whose members share a distinct awareness of a 
common cultural identity, separating them from other groups around them. 

Exogamy: Requires the individual to marry outside of his/her own group.
Family: Is a group of persons directly linked by kin connections, the adult members of 

which assume responsibility of caring for children. 
Fertility: In the context of human population, this refers to the ability of human beings 

to reproduce. Since reproduction is primarily a female-centred process, fertility is 
calculated with reference to the female population, that is, in the child-bearing age 
group.

Gender: In social theory, the term reserved for the socially and culturally produced 
differences between men and women. (As different from ‘sex’ which refers to the 
physical-biological differences between men and women) Nature creates sexes, 
society creates genders.

Geometric progression: See ‘progression – geometric’

changes that have increased the interdependence, integration, and interaction 
among people and economic actors (companies) in disparate locations.

Integration:  A process of cultural unification whereby cultural distinctions are relegated 
to the private domain and a common public culture is adopted for all groups. 
This usually involves the adoption of the dominant culture as the official culture. 
Expressions of cultural difference or distinctiveness are not encouraged or 
sometimes even prohibited in the public domain. 

Jajmani system: Non-market exchange of produce, goods, and services within the 
(north) Indian village, without the use of money, based on the caste system and 
customary practices.

Jati:  The word for caste; a region-specific hierarchical ordering of castes that marry 
within their boundaries, pursue hereditary occupations and are fixed by birth. This 
is the traditional system, but it has undergone many changes over time.

Kinship: Ties are connections between individuals, established either through marriage 
or through the lines of descent that connect blood relatives (mothers, fathers, 
siblings, offspring, etc.)

Labour power: Capacity for labour; the mental and physical capabilities of human beings 
that are used in the process of production. (As different from labour, which is work 
performed) 

Laissez-faire: (French; literally, ‘let be’ or ‘leave alone’) – an economic philosophy that 
advocates free market system and minimal government intervention in economic 
matters. 

Liberalisation: The process whereby state controls over economic activity are relaxed 
and left to the market forces to decide. In general, a process of making laws more 
liberal or permissive.

Life chances: The potential opportunities or possible achievements available to a person 
during their life.

Lifestyle: A way of life; more concretely, the specific kinds and levels of consumption that 
define the everyday life of particular social groups.

Marketisation: The use of market based solutions to solve social, political, or economic 
problems.

Marriage: A socially acknowledged and approved sexual union between two adult 
individuals. When two people marry, they become kin to one another.

Minority groups: A group of people in a minority in a given society who, because of 
their distinct physical or cultural characteristics, find themselves in situations of 
inequality within that society. Such groups include ethnic minorities. 

Mode of production: In Marx’s historical materialism, a specific combination of forces 
of production and relations of production that create a historically distinct social 
formation.

Reciprocity: Informal, culturally regulated exchange (trade) of goods and services in a 
132 non-market economy.

Role Conflict: Conflict between the different social roles that the same individual is 
expected to play. For example, a working father may experience a role conflict 
between his role as a worker and his role as a father or husband.

Glossary

Monogamy: Restricts the individual to one spouse at a time. Under this system, at any 
given time a man can have only one wife and a woman can have only  
one husband.

Natal family: The family into which one is born, family of birth. (As different from the 
family into which one is married.)

Nation: A community that believes itself to be a community, based on several shared 
characteristics such as: common language, geographical location, history, religion, 
race, ethnicity, political aspirations, etc. However, nations may exist without one 
or more of such characteristics. A nation is comprised of its people, who are the 
ultimate guarantors of its existence, meaning and powers.

Nation - state: A particular type of state, characteristic of the modern world, in 
which a government has sovereign power within a defined territorial area, and 
the mass of the population are citizens who know themselves to be part of a 
single nation. Nation-states are closely associated with the rise of nationalism, 
although nationalist loyalties do not always conform to the boundaries of 
specific states that exist today. Nation-states developed as part of an emerging 
nation-state system, originating in Europe, but in current times spanning the 
whole globe.

Nationalism: Commitment, usually passionate commitment, to one’s nation and 
everything related to it. Putting the nation first, being biased in its favour, etc. The 
ideology that commonalities of language, religion, history, race, ethnicity, etc., 
make the community distinctive and unique.

Prejudice: The holding of preconceived ideas about an individual or group, ideas that 
are resistant to change even in the face of new information. Prejudice may be 
either positive or negative, but the common usage is for negative or derogatory 
preconceptions.

Preventive - checks: See ‘checks - preventive’ 
Productivity of agriculture: The amount of agricultural output (i.e., quantity of 

foodgrains or other crops) produced per unit area (e.g., acre, hectare, bigha, etc.). 
Increases in productivity refer to increases in agricultural output obtained solely 
through changes in the methods of farming and the quality of inputs, but without 
any expansion of the cultivated area. Examples of such changes include use of 
tractors, fertilisers, improved seeds, etc.

Progression - arithmetic: A series or sequence of numbers that may start with any 
number, but where each succeeding number is obtained by adding a fixed 
amount (number) to the preceding number. For example: 6, 10, 14, 18 and so 
on, where 6 is an arbitrary starting point, but 10 = 6 + 4; 14 = 10 + 4; 18 = 14 + 
4; and so on.

Progression - geometric: A series or sequence of numbers that may start with any 
number, but where each succeeding number is obtained by multiplying the 133
preceding number by a constant multiple. For example: 4, 20, 100, 500 and so on, 
where 4 is an arbitrary starting point, but 20 = 4 x 5; 100 = 20 x 5; 500 = 100 x 5; 
and so on.

Ind ian Soc iety

Reflexive: Literally, turning back on oneself. A reflexive (or self-reflexive) theory is one 
that seeks to explain not only the world but also its own operations within the 
world. Thus, a reflexive sociology will try to explain sociology itself as a social 
phenomenon, along with the other things it seeks to explain. Normally, theories 
seek to explain their object, not themselves.

Regionalism: The ideology of commitment to a particular regional identity which could be 
based on language, ethnicity and other characteristics in addition to geography.

Relations of production: Relations between people and groups with regard to 
production, especially those related to property and labour.

Replacement level: The level of fertility at which the existing generation produces 
just enough children to replace itself , so that the next generation is of the same 
size (total population) as the current one. This translates to the rule of thumb 
that a woman needs to have approximately 2.1 children to ensure that she and 
her spouse are ‘replaced’ (the extra 0.1 is required to compensate for the risk of 
unforeseen or accidental deaths). In other words, the replacement level of the total 
fertility rate is usually said to be 2.1.

Sanskritisation: A term invented by M.N. Srinivas to refer to the process by which middle 
or lower castes seek upward social mobility by imitating the ritual and social 
behaviour/practices of castes above themselves, usually brahmins or kshatriyas, 
also known as Dwija.

Scavenging: The practice of manual cleaning of human excreta and other garbage and 
waste products. Still practiced where sewerage systems are not in place. This can 
also be a service that the untouchable castes are forced to perform.

Secularism: There are different versions: (a) The doctrine by which the state is kept 
strictly separate from religion, i.e., separation of ‘church and state’ as in western 
societies. (b) The doctrine by which the state does not discriminate between 
different religions and shows equal respect to all. (c) The popular sense of the  
anti-thesis of communalism, i.e., an attitude that is not biased in favour of or 
against any religion.

Social constructionism: The perspective that emphasises society over nature in 
explaining reality. It views social relations, values and interactions – rather than 
biology or nature – as being decisive in determining the meaning and content of 
reality. (For example, social constructionism believes that things like gender, old 
age, famine, etc., are more social than physical or natural.) 

Social exclusion: The combined outcome of deprivation and discrimination, which 
prevent individuals or groups from participating fully in the economic, social and 
political life of the society in which they live. Social exclusion is structural, i.e., the 
result of social processes and institutions rather than individual action. 

Son preference: The social phenomenon where members of a community prefer to 
have sons rather than daughters, i.e., they value sons more than daughters. The 

134 existence of son preference can be established by observing social behaviour 
towards sons and daughters, or by asking people directly about their preferences 
and perceptions.

Glossary

State: An abstract entity consisting of a set of political-legal institutions claiming 
control over a particular geographical territory and the people living in it. A set 
of interlinked institutions for maintaining a monopoly over the use of legitimate 
violence in a specified territorial area. Includes institutions like the legislature, 
judiciary, executive, the army, policy and administration. In another sense, the 
name given to a regional government within a larger national structure, as in state 
government of Tamil Nadu, etc.

Stereotype: A fixed and inflexible characterisation of a group of people.
Stratification: The hierarchical arrangement of different segments of society into ‘strata’ 

or sub-groups whose members share the same general position in the hierarchy. 
Stratification implies inequality; egalitarian societies are in theory lacking in strata, 
though they may have other forms of sub-grouping which are not arranged in 
hierarchical terms.

Stock Market: A market for ‘stocks’ or shares in companies. Joint stock companies raise 
capital by selling shares – a share is a specified portion of the company’s assets. 
Share holders pay money to own shares in a company, and the company uses this 
money to conduct its business. The shareholders are paid dividends, or a share 
of the profits made by the company that is distributed according to the number of 
shares held by each shareholder. A stock market is the place or mechanism for the 
buying and selling of such shares.

Surplus value: Increase in the value of investment, or return to capital; under capitalism, 
surplus value is derived from surplus labour, or labour performed that is in excess 
of what is needed to equal the wage paid to the labourer.

Syncretism: A cultural phenomenon characterised by the inter-mingling or mixing 
of different religions or traditions. A hybrid of two distinct religious or cultural 
traditions.

Transgression: The violation of some rule or norm; going beyond socially or culturally 
determined rules and customs; breaking a social or cultural ‘law’ (which may not 
be a legal or formally written law).

Tribe: A social group consisting of collections of families and lineages (or clans) based on 
shared ties of kinship, ethnicity, common history or territorial-political organisation. 
Distinguished from a caste in that caste is a hierarchical system of mutually 
exclusive castes whereas a tribe is a single inclusive grouping (though it may have 
divisions based on clans or lineages).

Untouchability: A social practice within the caste system whereby members of the 
lowest castes are considered to be ritually impure to such an extent that they 
cause pollution by mere touch. Untouchable castes are at the bottom of the social 
scale and are excluded from most social institutions.

Varna: Literally, ‘colour’; a nation-wide version of the caste system dividing society into 
four hierarchically ordered varnas or caste groups named – brahmin, kshatriya, 135
vaishya and shudra.
