Foreword 

Information Technology has continuously been crossing the barriers of 
access and communication and reaching more and more people. The number 
of internet users in India has been on the rise. The tremendous growth in 
computer science, telecommunications and information technology has 
resulted in automation of various tasks and contributed to the ease of 
living. Technology has made continuous inroads into diverse areas—be it 
business, commerce, science, sports, health, transportation or education. 
Today, we are living in an interconnected world where computer based 
applications influence the way we learn, communicate, commute, or even 
socialise.

With so many users of Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT), huge volumes of data are continuously generated at an unprecedented 
rate. Many innovative business models are being evolved which utilise such 
data to reach potential customers in a more targeted way. Government 
agencies are also using data to deliver services and fast track progress 
of different programmes, strengthen accountability and to make more 
informed decisions. This has been creating better opportunities for our 
youth not only to enter the field of technical education but also in the 
world of work. NCERT, for the first time, has developed a textbook on 
‘Informatics Practices’ to develop skill sets in students to make use of the 
opportunities provided by ICT.

This book focuses on the fundamental concepts related to handling of 
data while opening a window to the emerging areas of data processing. It 
seeks to address the dual challenges of reducing curricular load as well as 
introducing the latest development in the field of ICT.

As an organisation committed to systemic reforms and continuous 
improvement in the quality of its curricular material, NCERT welcomes 
comments and suggestions to enable us to bring about necessary changes 
in its further publications.

Preface 

In the present education system of our country, specialised and 
discipline based courses are introduced at the higher secondary stage. 
This stage is crucial as well as challenging because of the transition 
from general to discipline-based curriculum. The syllabus at this stage 
needs to have sufficient rigour and depth while remaining mindful of the 
comprehension level of the learners. Further, the textbook should not be 
heavily loaded with content. 

We are living in an era where information drives many of our socio 
economic decisions. Millions of people are accessing internet round the 
clock for availing various services and thereby generating vast amount of 
data. Processing of data is becoming a key skill with applications across the 
disciplines. Thus, study of basic concepts of data handling and analysis 
is becoming more and more desirable. There are courses offered in the 
name of Computer Science, Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT), Information Technology (IT), etc. by various boards and schools up 
to secondary stage, as optional. These mainly focus on using computer for 
word processing, presentation tools and application software. 

Informatics Practices (IP) at the higher secondary stage of school 
education is also offered as an optional subject. At this stage, students 
can take up IP with the aim of pursuing a career in data science or related 
areas after going through professional courses at higher levels. Therefore, 
at higher secondary stage, the curriculum of IP introduces basics of 
database management systems and data processing. The book has seven 
chapters covering the following broader themes: 

•	 SQL Queries: Querying database using the Structured Query 
Language by applying SQL functions including aggregate functions.

•	 Data Handling: The popular Python library called Pandas has been 
introduced. The important data structures of Pandas – Series and 
DataFrame have been covered in details and basic data handling 
and data analysis using Pandas are included.

•	 Data Visualisation: The Pandas library called Pyplot is introduced. 
It demonstrates how to generate high quality graphs and charts 
from Python using the Pyplot tool.

•	 Internet and Web: Introduction to the concepts of Computer 
networks are given, followed by a brief overview of Internet, its 
application are given. The concept of web, website, and its hosting 
is also included. 

•	 Societal Impact: Awareness of digital footprints, data privacy and 
protection, cyber crime, etiquettes, copyright and plagiarism, 
E-waste in a digital society and their implications on security, 
privacy, piracy, ethics, values and health concerns.

Each chapter has two additional components — (i) activities and 
(ii) think and reflect for self assessment while learning as well as to generate 
further interest in the learner. A number of hands-on examples are given to 
gradually explain methodology to solve different types of problems across 
the Chapters. The programming examples as well as the exercises in the 
chapters are required to be solved in a computer and verify with the given 
outputs.  

Box items are pinned inside the chapters either to explain related 
concepts or to describe additional information related to the topic covered 
in that section. However, these box-items are not to be assessed through 
examinations.

Project Based Learning given at the end includes exemplar projects 
related to real-world problems. Teachers are supposed to assign these or 
similar projects to be developed in groups. Working in such projects may 
promote peer-learning, team spirit and responsiveness.

The chapters have been written by involving practicing teachers as well 
as subject experts. Several iterations have resulted into this book. Thanks 
are due to the authors and reviewers for their valuable contribution. I would 
like to place on record appreciation for Professor Om Vikas for leading the 
review activities of the book as well as for his guidance and motivation 
to the development team throughout. Comments and suggestions 
are welcome.

1.2 Functions in sQL

We know that a function is used to perform some 
particular task and it returns zero or more values as a 
result. Functions are useful while writing SQL queries 
also. Functions can be applied to work on single or 
multiple records (rows) of a table. Depending on their 
application in one or multiple rows, SQL functions 
are categorised as Single row functions and Aggregate 
functions. 

1.2.1 Single Row Functions

These are also known as Scalar functions. Single row 
functions are applied on a single value and return 
a single value. Figure 1.2 lists different single row 
functions under three categories —  Numeric (Math), 
String, Date and Time. 
Math functions accept numeric value as input, and 
return a numeric value as a result. String functions 
accept character value as input, and return either 
character or numeric values as output. Date and 
time functions accept date and time values as input, 
and return numeric or string, or date and time values 
as output.

Example 1.1
In order to increase sales, suppose the car dealer decides 
to offer his customers to pay the total amount in 10 
easy EMIs (equal monthly installments). Assume that 
EMIs are required to be in multiples of 10,000. For that, 
the dealer wants to list the CarID and Price along with 
the following data from the Inventory table:
a) Calculate GST as 12% of Price and display the result 

after rounding it off to one decimal place.

mysql> SELECT ROUND(12/100*Price,1) "GST" 
FROM INVENTORY;
+- - - - - - - - - +
|  GST     |

1.2.2 Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions are also called multiple row functions. 
These functions work on a set of records as a whole, 
and return a single value for each column of the records 
on which the function is applied. Table 1.8 shows the 
differences between single row functions and multiple 
row functions. Table 1.9 describes some of the aggregate 
functions along with their usage. Note that column 
must be of numeric type.

Table 1.8 Differences between Single row and Multiple row Functions

Single_row Functions Multiple_row functions

1. It operates on a single row at a time. 1. It operates on groups of rows.

2. It returns one result per row. 2. It returns one result for a group of rows.

3. It can be used in Select, Where, and Order 3. It can be used in the select clause only.

4. Math, String and Date functions are 4. Max(), Min(), Avg(), Sum(), Count() and Count(*) 
examples of single row functions. are examples of multiple row functions.

1.3 GRouP BY in sQL

At times we need to fetch a group of rows on the 
basis of common values in a column. This can be 
done using a GROUP BY clause. It groups the rows 
together that contain the same values in a specified 
column. We can use the aggregate functions (COUNT, 
MAX, MIN, AVG and SUM) to work on the grouped 
values. HAVING Clause in SQL is used to specify 
conditions on the rows with GROUP BY clause. 

Consider the SALE table from the CARSHOWROOM 
database:
mys ql > SELECT * FROM SALE;

1.4 oPeRations on ReLations 

We can perform certain operations on relations like 
Union, Intersection, and Set Difference to merge the 
tuples of two tables. These three operations are binary 
operations as they work upon two tables. Note here, that 
these operations can only be applied if both the relations 
have the same number of attributes, and corresponding 
attributes in both tables have the same domain. 

1.4.1 UNION (U)

This operation is used to combine the selected rows of 
two tables at a time. If some rows are the same in both 
the tables, then the result of the Union operation will 
show those rows only once. Figure 1.3 shows union of 
two sets.

If we need the list of students participating in either 
of events, then we have to apply UNION operation 
(represented by symbol U) on relations DANCE and MUSIC. 
The output of UNION operation is shown in Table 1.12.

Intersect operation is used to get the common tuples 
from two tables and is represented by the symbol ∩. 
Figure 1.4 shows intersection of two sets.

Figure 1.4: Intersection of two sets

Suppose we have to display the list of students 
who are participating in both the events (DANCE and 
MUSIC), then intersection operation is to be applied on 
these two tables. The output of INTERSECT operation is 
shown in Table 1.13.

This operation is used to get tuples/rows which are 
in the first table but not in the second table, and the 
operation is represented by the symbol - (minus). Figure 
1.5 shows minus operation (also called set difference) 
between two sets.

Figure 1.5:  Difference of two sets

Suppose, we want the list of students who are only

1.4.4 Cartesian Product

Cartesian product operation combines tuples from two 
relations. It results in all pairs of rows from the two input 
relations, regardless of whether or not they have the 
same values on common attributes. It is denoted as ‘X’.

The degree of the resulting relation is calculated 
as the sum of the degrees of both the relations under 
consideration. The cardinality of the resulting relation is 
calculated as the product of the cardinality of relations 
on which cartesian product is applied. Let us use 
the relations DANCE and MUSIC to show the output 
of cartesian product. Note that both relations are of 
degree 3. The cardinality of relations DANCE and MUSIC 
is 4 and 5 respectively. Applying cartesian product on 
these two relations will result in a relation of degree 6 
and cardinality 20, as shown in Table 1.15.

1.5 usinG two ReLations in a QueRY

Till now, we have written queries in SQL using a single 
relation only. In this section, we will learn to write 
queries using two relations.

1.5.1 Cartesian product on two tables

From the previous section, we learnt that application 
of operator cartesian product on two tables results 
in a table having all combinations of tuples from the 
underlying tables. When more than one table is to be 
used in a query, then we must specify the table names 
by separating commas in the FROM clause, as shown in 
Example 1.7. On execution of such a query, the DBMS 
(MySql) will first apply cartesian product on specified 
tables to have a single table. The following query of 
Example 1.7 applies cartesian product on the two tables 
DANCE and MUSIC:

Example 1.7

a) Display all possible combinations of tuples of 
relations DANCE and MUSIC
mys ql > SELECT * FROM DANCE,  MUSI C;

 As we are using SELECT * in the query, the output will 
be the Table 1.15 having degree 6 and cardinality 20.

notes b) From the all possible combinations of tuples of 
relations DANCE and MUSIC, display only those 
rows such that the attribute name in both have the 
same value.

= M. Na me ;

2 r ows  i n  s e t  ( 0 . 00 s e c )

   Note that in this query we have used table aliases 
(D for DANCE and M for MUSIC), just like column 
aliases to refer to tables by shortened names. It is 
important to note that table alias is valid only for 
current query and the original table name cannot be 
used in the query if its alias is given in FROM clause.

1.5.2 JOIN on two tables

JOIN operation combines tuples from two tables on 
specified conditions. This is unlike cartesian product, 
which make all possible combinations of tuples. While 
using the JOIN clause of SQL, we specify conditions on 
the related attributes of two tables within the FROM 
clause. Usually, such an attribute is the primary key 
in one table and foreign key in another table. Let us 
create two tables UNIFORM (UCode, UName, UColor) 
and COST (UCode, Size, Price) in the SchoolUniform 
database. UCode is Primary Key in table UNIFORM. 
UCode and Size is the Composite Key in table COST. 
Therefore, Ucode is a common attribute between the 
two tables which can be used to fetch the common data 
from both the tables. Hence, we need to define Ucode as 
foreign key in the Price table while creating this table.

Example 1.7
List the UCode, UName, UColor, Size and Price of related 
tuples of  tables UNIFORM and COST.
The given query may be written in three different ways 
as given below:

4 r ows  i n  s e t  ( 0 . 08 s e c )

  As the attribute Ucode is in both tables, we need 
to use table alias to remove ambiguity. Hence, we 
have used qualifier with attribute UCode in SELECT 
and FROM clauses to indicate its scope.

b) Explicit use of JOIN clause
mys ql > SELECT * FROM UNI FORM U J OI N COST C ON 
U. Uc ode =C. Uc ode ;

   The output of the query is the same as shown 
in Table 1.19. In this query, we have used JOIN 
clause explicitly along with condition in FROM 
clause. Hence, no condition needs to be given in 
WHERE clause.

c) Explicit use of NATURAL JOIN clause
    The output of queries (a) and (b) shown in Table 
1.19 has a repetitive column Ucode having exactly 
the same values. This redundant column provides 
no additional information. There is an extension 
of JOIN operation called NATURAL JOIN which 
works similar to JOIN clause in SQL, but removes 
the redundant attribute. This operator can be used

   It is clear from the output that the result of this 
query is same as that of queries written in (a) and (b), 
except that the attribute Ucode appears only once.

Following are some of the points to be considered 
while applying JOIN operations on two or more relations:

• If two tables are to be joined on equality condition 
on the common attribute, then one may use JOIN 
with ON clause or NATURAL JOIN in FROM clause. 
If three tables are to be joined on equality condition, 
then two JOIN or NATURAL JOIN are required.

• In general, N-1 joins are needed to combine N tables 
on equality condition.

• With JOIN clause, we may use any relational 
operators to combine tuples of two tables.

Summary

• A Function is used to perform a particular task 
and return a value as a result.

• Single row functions work on a single row to 
return a single value. 

• Multiple row functions work on a set of records as 
a whole and return a single value.

• Numeric functions perform operations on numeric 
values and return numeric values.

• String functions perform operations on character 
type values and return either character or numeric 
values.

well-established Python libraries for scientific 
and analytical use. These libraries allow us 
to manipulate, transform and visualise data 
easily and efficiently.  

NumPy, which stands for ‘Numerical 
Python’, is a library we discussed in class 
XI. Recall that, it is a package that can 
be used for numerical data analysis and

notes scientific computing. NumPy uses a multidimensional 
array object and has functions and tools for working 
with these arrays.  Elements of an array stay together in 
memory, hence, they can be quickly accessed.

 
PANDAS (PANel DAta) is a high-level data manipulation 

tool used for analysing data. It is very easy to import 
and export data using Pandas library which has a very 
rich set of functions. It is built on packages like NumPy 
and Matplotlib and gives us a single, convenient place 
to do most of our data analysis and visualisation work. 
Pandas has three important data structures, namely – 
Series, DataFrame and Panel to make the process of 
analysing data organised, effective and efficient.

The Matplotlib library in Python is used for plotting 
graphs and visualisation. Using Matplotlib, with just a 
few lines of code we can generate publication quality 
plots, histograms, bar charts, scatterplots, etc. It is 
also built on Numpy, and is designed to work well with 
Numpy and Pandas. 

You may think what the need for Pandas is when 
NumPy can be used for data analysis. Following are 
some of the differences between Pandas and Numpy:
1. A Numpy array requires homogeneous data, while 

a Pandas DataFrame can have different data types 
(float, int, string, datetime, etc.). 

2. Pandas have a simpler interface for operations like 
file loading, plotting, selection, joining, GROUP 
BY, which come very handy in data-processing 
applications.

3. Pandas DataFrames (with column names) make it 
very easy to keep track of data. 

4. Pandas is used when data is in Tabular Format, 
whereas Numpy is used for numeric array based 
data manipulation.

2.1.1. Installing Pandas

Installing Pandas is very similar to installing NumPy. To 
install Pandas from command line, we need to type in:

pi p i ns t a l l  pa nda s

Note that both NumPy and Pandas can be installed 
only when Python is already installed on that system. 
The same is true for other libraries of Python.

2.1.2. Data Structure in Pandas

A data structure is a collection of data values and 
operations that can be applied to that data. It enables 
efficient storage, retrieval and modification to the data. 
For example, we have already worked with a data 
structure ndarray in NumPy in Class XI. Recall the ease 
with which we can store, access and update data using 
a NumPy array. Two commonly used data structures in 
Pandas that we will cover in this book are: 
• Series 
• DataFrame

2.2 serIes

A Series is a one-dimensional array containing a 
sequence of values of any data type (int, float, list, 
string, etc) which by default have numeric data labels 
starting from zero. The data label associated with a 
particular value is called its index. We can also assign 
values of other data types as index. We can imagine a 
Pandas Series as a column in a spreadsheet. Example 
of a series containing names of students is given below:

I nde x Va l ue
0  Ar na b
1  Sa mr i dhi
2   Ra mi t
3   Di vya m
4  Kr i t i ka

2.2.1 Creation of Series

There are different ways in which a series can be created 
in Pandas. To create or use series, we first need to import 
the Pandas library.

(A) Creation of Series from Scalar Values
A Series can be created using scalar values as shown in 
the example below:

>>> i mpor t  pa nda s  a s  pd   # i mpor t  Pa nda s  wi t h  a l i a s  pd
>>> s e r i e s 1 = pd. Se r i e s ( [ 10, 20, 30] )   #c r e a t e  a  Se r i e s
>>> pr i nt ( s e r i e s 1)   #Di s pl a y t he  s e r i e s

Output:
0    10
1    20
2    30
dt ype :  i n t 64

Reprint 2025-26



30 InformatIcs PractIces

Observe that output is shown in two columns -  the 
index is on the left and the data value is on the right. If 
we do not explicitly specify an index for the data values 
while creating a series, then by default indices range 
from 0 through N –  1. Here N is the number of data 
elements.

We can also assign user-defined labels to the index 
and use them to access elements of a Series. The 

Activity 2.1
following example has a numeric index in random order. 

Create a series having 
names of any five >>> s e r i e s 2 = pd. Se r i e s ( [ " Ka vi " , " Shya m" , " Ra

vi " ] ,  i nde x=[ 3, 5 , 1] )
famous monuments of 

>>> pr i nt ( s e r i e s 2)   #Di s pl a y t he  s e r i e s
India and assign their 
States as index values.

Output:
3     Ka vi
5    Shya m
1     Ra vi
dt ype :  obj e c t

Here, data values Kavi, Shyam and Ravi have index 
values 3, 5 and 1, respectively. We can also use letters 
or strings as indices, for example:

>>> s e r i e s 2 = pd. Se r i e s ( [ 2 , 3 , 4] , i nde x=[ " Fe b" , " M
a r " , " Apr " ] )
>>> pr i nt ( s e r i e s 2)  #Di s pl a y t he  s e r i e s

Think and Reflect Output:
Fe b    2

While importing Ma r     3
Pandas, is it Apr     4
mandatory to always dt ype :  i n t 64
use pd as an alias   
name? What would 

Here, data values 2,3,4 have index values Feb, Mar 
happen if we give any 
other name? and Apr, respectively.

(B) Creation of Series from NumPy Arrays
We can create a series from a one-dimensional (1D) 
NumPy array, as shown below: 

>>> i mpor t  numpy a s  np  #  i mpor t  NumPy wi t h  a l i a s  np
>>> i mpor t  pa nda s  a s  pd
>>> a r r a y1 = np. a r r a y( [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4] )
>>> s e r i e s 3 = pd. Se r i e s ( a r r a y1)
>>> pr i nt ( s e r i e s 3)

Output:
0    1
1    2
2    3
3    4
dt ype :  i n t 32

Reprint 2025-26



Data HanDling Using PanDas - i 31

The following example shows that we can use letters notes

or strings as indices:

>>> s e r i e s 4 = pd. Se r i e s ( a r r a y1,  i nde x = [ " J a n" ,  
" Fe b" ,  " Ma r " ,  " Apr " ] )
>>> pr i nt ( s e r i e s 4)
J a n    1
Fe b    2
Ma r     3
Apr     4
dt ype :  i n t 32

When index labels are passed with the array, then 
the length of the index and array must be of the same 
size, else it will result in a ValueError. In the example 
shown below, array1 contains 4 values whereas there 
are only 3 indices, hence ValueError is displayed.

>>> s e r i e s 5 = pd. Se r i e s ( a r r a y1,  i nde x = [ " J a n" ,  
" Fe b" ,  " Ma r " ] )
Va l ue Er r or :  Le ngt h of  pa s s e d va l ue s  i s  4 ,  i nde x 
i mpl i e s  3

(C) Creation of Series from Dictionary
Recall that Python dictionary has key: value pairs and 
a value can be quickly retrieved when its key is known. 
Dictionary keys can be used to construct an index for a 
Series, as shown in the following example. Here, keys of 
the dictionary dict1 become indices in the series. 

>>> di c t 1  = { ' I ndi a ' :  ' Ne wDe l hi ' ,  ' UK' :  
' London ' ,  ' J a pa n ' :  ' Tokyo ' }
>>> pr i nt ( di c t 1)   #Di s pl a y t he  di c t i ona r y
{ ' I ndi a ' :  ' Ne wDe l hi ' ,  ' UK' :  ' London ' ,  ' J a pa n ' :  
' Tokyo ' }
>>> s e r i e s 8 = pd. Se r i e s ( di c t 1)  
>>> pr i nt ( s e r i e s 8)   #Di s pl a y t he  s e r i e s
I ndi a     Ne wDe l hi
UK         London
J a pa n       Tokyo
dt ype :  obj e c t

2.2.2 Accessing Elements of a Series

There are two common ways for accessing the elements 
of a series: Indexing and Slicing.

(A) Indexing
Indexing in Series is similar to that for NumPy arrays, 
and is used to access elements in a series. Indexes 
are of two types: positional index and labelled index. 
Positional index takes an integer value that corresponds 
to its position in the series starting from 0, whereas 
labelled index takes any user-defined label as index.

Reprint 2025-26



32 InformatIcs PractIces

• Following example shows usage of the positional 
index for accessing a value from a Series.

>>> s e r i e s Num = pd. Se r i e s ( [ 10, 20, 30] )
>>> s e r i e s Num[ 2]
30

Here, the value 30 is displayed for the positional 
index 2.

When labels are specified, we can use labels as 
indices while selecting values from a Series, as shown 
below. Here, the value 3 is displayed for the labelled 
index Mar.

>>> s e r i e s Mnt hs  = pd. Se r i e s ( [ 2 , 3 , 4] , i nde x=[ " Fe b
" , " Ma r " , " Apr " ] )
>>> s e r i e s Mnt hs [ " Ma r " ]
3

In the following example, value NewDelhi is 
displayed for the labelled index India. 

>>> s e r i e s Ca pCnt r y  = pd. Se r i e s ( [ ' Ne wDe l hi ' ,    
     ' Wa s hi ngt onDC' ,  ' London ' ,  ' Pa r i s ' ] ,  
i nde x=[ ' I ndi a ' ,  ' USA' ,  ' UK' ,  ' Fr a nc e ' ] )

Activity 2.2 >>> s e r i e s Ca pCnt r y[ ' I ndi a ' ]
' Ne wDe l hi '

Write the statement to 
get NewDelhi as output We can also access an element of the series using 
using positional index. the positional index:

>>> s e r i e s Ca pCnt r y[ 1]
' Wa s hi ngt onDC'

More than one element of a series can be accessed 
using a list of positional integers or a list of index 
labels as shown in the following examples:

>>> s e r i e s Ca pCnt r y[ [ 3 , 2] ]
Fr a nc e      Pa r i s
UK        London
dt ype :  obj e c t

>>> s e r i e s Ca pCnt r y[ [ ' UK' , ' USA' ] ]
UK           London
USA    Wa s hi ngt onDC
dt ype :  obj e c t

The index values associated with the series can be 
altered by assigning new index values as shown in 
the following example:

>>> s e r i e s Ca pCnt r y . i nde x=[ 10, 20, 30, 40]
>>> s e r i e s Ca pCnt r y

40           Pa r i s
dt ype :  obj e c t

(B) Slicing
Sometimes, we may need to extract a part of a series. 
This can be done through slicing. This is similar to 
slicing used with NumPy arrays. We can define which 
part of the series is to be sliced by specifying the start 
and end parameters [start :end] with the series name. 
When we use positional indices for slicing, the value 
at the endindex position is excluded, i.e., only (end - 
start) number of data values of the series are extracted. 
Consider the following series seriesCapCntry: 

>>> s e r i e s Ca pCnt r y  = pd. Se r i e s ( [ ' Ne wDe l hi ' ,  ' Wa s hi ngt onDC' ,  ' London ' ,  
' Pa r i s ' ] ,  i nde x=[ ' I ndi a ' ,  ' USA' ,  ' UK' ,  ' Fr a nc e ' ] )

 >>> s e r i e s Ca pCnt r y[ 1: 3]  #e xc l ude s  t he  va l ue  a t  i nde x pos i t i on 3

USA    Wa s hi ngt onDC
UK           London         
d t ype :  obj e c t

As we can see that in the above output, only data 
values  at indices 1 and 2 are displayed. If labelled 
indexes are used for slicing, then value at the end index 
label is also included in the output, for example: 

>>> s e r i e s Ca pCnt r y[ ' USA'  :  ' Fr a nc e ' ]  

USA       Wa s hi ngt onDC
UK              London    
Fr a nc e            Pa r i s
dt ype :  obj e c t

We can also get the series in reverse order, for 
example: 

>>> s e r i e s Ca pCnt r y[  :  :  - 1]
Fr a nc e            Pa r i s
UK              London
USA       Wa s hi ngt onDC
I ndi a          Ne wDe l hi
dt ype :  obj e c t

notes We can also use slicing to modify the values of series 
elements as shown in the following example: 

>>> i mpor t  numpy a s  np
>>> s e r i e s Al ph = pd. Se r i e s ( np. a r a nge ( 10, 16, 1) ,  
i nde x = [ ' a ' ,  ' b ' ,  ' c ' ,  ' d ' ,  ' e ' ,  ' f ' ] )
>>> s e r i e s Al ph
a     10

Observe that updating the values in a series using 
slicing also excludes the value at the end index position. 
But, it changes the value at the end index label when 
slicing is done using labels.

2.2.3 Attributes of Series

We can access certain properties called attributes of 
a series by using that property with the series name.

2.2.5 Mathematical Operations on Series

We have learnt in Class XI that if we perform basic 
mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, etc., on two NumPy arrays, 
the operation is done on each corresponding pair of 
elements. Similarly, we can perform mathematical 
operations on two series in Pandas.

While performing mathematical operations on series, 
index matching is implemented and all missing values 
are filled in with NaN by default. 

Consider the following series: seriesA and seriesB 
for understanding mathematical operations on series in 
Pandas.

>>> s e r i e s A = pd. Se r i e s ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5] ,  i nde x = 
[ ' a ' ,  ' b ' ,  ' c ' ,  ' d ' ,  ' e ' ] )

(A) Addition of two Series
It can be done in two ways. In the first method, two 
series are simply added together, as shown in the 
following code. Table 2.2 shows the detailed values that 
were matched while performing the addition. Note here 
that the output of addition is NaN if one of the elements 
or both elements have no value.

>>> s e r i e s A + s e r i e s B 
a      - 9 . 0
b      Na N
c     - 47. 0
d      Na N
e     105. 0
y      Na N
z       Na N

b 2 NaN

c 3 -50 -47.0

d 4 NaN

e 5 100 105.00

y 20 NaN

z 10 NaN

The second method is applied when we do not 
want to have NaN values in the output. We can use 
the series method add() and a parameter fill_value to 
replace missing value with a specified value. That is, 
calling seriesA.add(seriesB) is equivalent to calling 
seriesA+seriesB, but add() allows explicit specification 
of the fill value for any element in seriesA or seriesB 
that might be missing, as shown in Table 2.3.

subtraction, multiplication and division can also be

explicitly calling of the appropriate method.

2.3 dataFrame

Sometimes we need to work on multiple columns at 
a time, i.e., we need to process the tabular data. For 
example, the result of a class, items in a restaurant’s 
menu, reservation chart of a train, etc. Pandas store 
such tabular data using a DataFrame. A DataFrame is 
a two-dimensional labelled data structure like a table 
of MySQL. It contains rows and columns, and therefore 
has both a row and column index. Each column can 
have a different type of value such as numeric, string, 
boolean, etc., as in tables of a database.

Some of them are listed in this section.

Empt y Da t a Fr a me we pass 3 columns or 

Col umns :  [ ] 5 columns instead of 

I nde x:  [ ] 4 in the above code? 
What is the reason?

(B) Creation of DataFrame from NumPy ndarrays
Consider the following three NumPy ndarrays. Let us 
create a simple DataFrame without any column labels, 
using a single ndarray:

>>> i mpor t  numpy a s  np
>>> a r r a y1 = np. a r r a y( [ 10, 20, 30] )
>>> a r r a y2 = np. a r r a y( [ 100, 200, 300] )
>>> a r r a y3 = np. a r r a y( [ - 10, - 20, - 30,  - 40] )

>>> dFr a me 4 = pd. Da t a Fr a me ( a r r a y1)
>>> dFr a me 4
    0
0  10
1  20
2  30

We can create a DataFrame using more than one 
ndarrays, as shown in the following example:

>>> dFr a me 5 = pd. Da t a Fr a me ( [ a r r a y1,  a r r a y3,  
a r r a y2] ,  c ol umns =[  ' A' ,  ' B' ,  ' C' ,  ' D' ] )
>>> dFr a me 5
     A    B    C     D
0   10   20   30   Na N
1  - 10  - 20  - 30 - 40. 0
2  100  200  300   Na N

(C) Creation of DataFrame from List of Dictionaries
We can create DataFrame from a list of Dictionaries, for 
example:

# Cr e a t e  l i s t  of  d i c t i ona r i e s
>>> l i s t Di c t  = [ { ' a ' : 10,  ' b ' : 20} ,  { ' a ' : 5 ,  
' b ' : 10,  ' c ' : 20} ]

>>> dFr a me Li s t Di c t  = pd. Da t a Fr a me ( l i s t Di c t )
>>> dFr a me Li s t Di c t
    a    b      c
0   10  20   Na N
1   5   10  20. 0

Here, the dictionary keys are taken as column 
labels, and the values corresponding to each key are 
taken as rows. There will be as many rows as the 
number of dictionaries present in the list. In the above 
example there are two dictionaries in the list. So, the 
DataFrame consists of two rows. Number of columns 

Reprint 2025-26



42 InformatIcs PractIces

in a DataFrame is equal to the maximum number of 
keys in any dictionary of the list. Hence, there are three 
columns as the second dictionary has three elements. 
Also, note that NaN (Not a Number) is inserted if a 
corresponding value for a column is missing.

(D) Creation of DataFrame from Dictionary of Lists
DataFrames can also be created from a dictionary of 
lists. Consider the following dictionary consisting of the 
keys ‘State’, ‘GArea’ (geographical area) and ‘VDF’ (very 
dense forest) and the corresponding values as list.

>>> di c t For e s t  = { ' St a t e ' :  [ ' As s a m' ,  ' De l hi ' ,  
' Ke r a l a ' ] ,
  ' GAr e a ' :  [ 78438,  1483,  38852]  ,
  ' VDF'  :  [ 2797,  6 . 72, 1663] }
>>> dFr a me For e s t = pd. Da t a Fr a me ( di c t For e s t )
>>> dFr a me For e s t
    St a t e    GAr e a     VDF
0   As s a m   78438  2797. 00
1   De l hi    1483     6 . 72
2   Ke r a l a   38852  1663. 00

Note that dictionary keys become column labels by 
default in a DataFrame, and the lists become the rows. 
Thus, a DataFrame can be thought of as a dictionary of 
lists or a dictionary of series.

We can change the sequence of columns in a 
DataFrame. This can be done by assigning a particular 
sequence of the dictionary keys as columns parameter, 
for example: 

>>> dFr a me For e s t 1  = pd. Da t a Fr a me ( di c t For e s t ,  
c ol umns  = [ ' St a t e ' , ' VDF' ,  ' GAr e a ' ] )
>>> dFr a me For e s t 1
    St a t e       VDF   GAr e a
0   As s a m   2797. 00  78438
1   De l hi      6 . 72   1483
2   Ke r a l a   1663. 00  38852

In the output, VDF is now displayed as the middle 
column instead of last.

(E) Creation of DataFrame from Series
Consider the following three Series:

s e r i e s A = pd. Se r i e s ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5] ,
  i nde x = [ ' a ' ,  ' b ' ,  ' c ' ,  ' d ' ,  ' e ' ] )

s er i es B = pd. Ser i es  ( [ 1000, 2000, - 1000, - 5000, 1000] ,
  i nde x = [ ' a ' ,  ' b ' ,  ' c ' ,  ' d ' ,  ' e ' ] )

Reprint 2025-26



Data HanDling Using PanDas - i 43

s e r i e s C = pd. Se r i e s ( [ 10, 20, - 10, - 50, 100] , notes

  i nde x = [ ' z ' ,  ' y ' ,  ' a ' ,  ' c ' ,  ' e ' ] )

We can create a DataFrame using a single series as 
shown below:

>>> dFr a me 6 = pd. Da t a Fr a me ( s e r i e s A)
>>> dFr a me 6
   0
a   1
b  2
c   3
d  4
e   5

Here, the DataFrame dFrame6 has as many numbers 
of rows as the numbers of elements in the series, but 
has only one column. To create a DataFrame using 
more than one series, we need to pass multiple series in 
the list as shown below:

>>> dFr a me 7 = pd. Da t a Fr a me ( [ s e r i e s A,  s e r i e s B] )
>>> dFr a me 7
a      b      c      d      e
0      1      2      3      4      5
1  1000  2000 - 1000 - 5000  1000

Observe that the labels in the series object become 
the column names in the DataFrame object and each 
series becomes a row in the DataFrame. Now look at the 
following example:

>>> dFr a me 8 = pd. Da t a Fr a me ( [ s e r i e s A,  s e r i e s C] )
>>> dFr a me 8
a     b      c     d       e      z      y
0   1 . 0   2 . 0    3 . 0   4 . 0     5 . 0    Na N   Na N
1 - 10. 0   Na N - 50. 0   Na N  100. 0   10. 0   20. 0

Here, different series do not have the same set of 
labels. But, the number of columns in a DataFrame 
equals to distinct labels in all the series. So, if a particular 
series does not have a corresponding value for a label, 
NaN is inserted in the DataFrame column.

(F) Creation of DataFrame from Dictionary of Series
A dictionary of series can also be used to create a 
DataFrame. For example, ResultSheet is a dictionary of 
series containing marks of 5 students in three subjects. 
The names of the students are the keys to the dictionary, 
and the index values of the series are the subject names 
as shown below:

same? Hi ndi        97     96        88    67       99

The following output shows that every column in the 
DataFrame is a Series:

>>> t ype ( Re s ul t DF. Ar na b)  
<c l a s s  ' pa nda s . c or e . s e r i e s . Se r i e s ' >

When a DataFrame is created from a Dictionary of 
Series, the resulting index or row labels are a union of all 
series indexes used to create the DataFrame. For example: 

di c t For Uni on = {  ' Se r i e s 1 '  :  
pd. Se r i e s ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5] ,
  i nde x = [ ' a ' ,  ' b ' ,  ' c ' ,  ' d ' ,  ' e ' ] )  ,
       ' Se r i e s 2 '  :  
pd. Se r i e s ( [ 10, 20, - 10, - 50, 100] ,
  i nde x = [ ' z ' ,  ' y ' ,  ' a ' ,  ' c ' ,  ' e ' ] ) ,

2.3.2 Operations on rows and columns in DataFrames

We can perform some basic operations on rows and 
columns of a DataFrame like selection, deletion, 
addition, and renaming, as discussed in this section.

(A) Adding a New Column to a DataFrame
We can easily add a new column to a DataFrame. Let 
us consider the DataFrame ResultDF defined earlier. In 
order to add a new column for another student ‘Preeti’, 
we can write the following statement: 

>>> Re s ul t DF[ ' Pr e e t i ' ] =[ 89, 78, 76]
>>> Re s ul t DF
                
         Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya   Ma l l i ka  Pr e e t i
Ma t hs        90     92        89    81       94     89
Sc i e nc e      91     81        91    71       95     78
Hi ndi        97     96        88    67       99     76

Assigning values to a new column label that does not 
exist will create a new column at the end. If the column 
already exists in the DataFrame then the assignment 
statement will update the values of the already existing 
column, for example:

>>> Re s ul t DF[ ' Ra mi t ' ] =[ 99,  98,  78]
>>> Re s ul t DF
         Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya   Ma l l i ka  Pr e e t i
Ma t hs        90     99        89    81       94     89
Sc i e nc e      91     98        91    71       95     78
Hi ndi        97     78        88    67       99     76

We can also change data of an entire column to a 
particular value in a DataFrame. For example, the 
following statement sets marks=90 for all subjects for 
the column name 'Arnab':

>>> Re s ul t DF[ ' Ar na b ' ] =90
>>> Re s ul t DF

         Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya   Ma l l i ka  Pr e e t i
Ma t hs        90     99        89    81       94     89
Sc i e nc e      90     98        91    71       95     78
Hi ndi        90     78        88    67       99     76

(B)  Adding a New Row to a DataFrame
We can add a new row to a DataFrame using the 
DataFrame.loc[ ] method. Consider the DataFrame 
ResultDF that has three rows for the three subjects – 
Maths, Science and Hindi. Suppose, we need to add the 
marks for English subject in ResultDF, we can use the 
following statement:

>>> Re s ul t DF
         Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya   Ma l l i ka   Pr e e t i
Ma t hs        90     92        89    81       94  89
Sc i e nc e      91     81        91    71       95      78
Hi ndi        97     96        88    67       99      76

>>> Re s ul t DF. l oc [ ' Engl i s h ' ]  = [ 85,  86,  83,  80,  90,  89]
>>> Re s ul t DF

We cannot use this method to add a row of data with 
already existing (duplicate) index value (label). In such 
case, a row with this index label will be updated, for 
example:

>>> Re s ul t DF. l oc [ ' Engl i s h ' ]  = [ 95,  86,  95,  80,  95, 99]
>>> Re s ul t DF

         Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya   Ma l l i ka   Pr e e t i

Hi ndi        97     96        88    67       99      76
Engl i s h      95     86        95    80       95      99

DataFRame.loc[] method can also be used to change 
the data values of a row to a particular value. For 
example, the following statement sets marks in 'Maths' 
for all columns to 0:

>>> Re s ul t DF. l oc [ ' Ma t hs ' ] =0
>>> Re s ul t DF
         Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya   Ma l l i ka   Pr e e t i
Ma t hs         0       0          0      0         0    0
Sc i e nc e      91     81        91    71       95      78
Hi ndi        97     96        88    67       99      76
Engl i s h      95     86        95    80       95      99

the number of rows than the number of rows in the DataFrame, it results

(C) Deleting Rows or Columns from a DataFrame notes

We can use the DataFrame.drop() method to delete rows 
and columns from a DataFrame. We need to specify the 
names of the labels to be dropped and the axis from 
which they need to be dropped. To delete a row, the 
parameter axis is assigned the value 0 and for deleting 
a column,the parameter axis is assigned the value 1. 
Consider the following DataFrame: 

 >>> Re s ul t DF
         Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya  Ma l l i ka
Ma t hs        90     92        89    81      94
Sc i e nc e      91     81        91    71      95
Hi ndi        97     96        88    67      99
Engl i s h      95     86        95    80      95

 The following example shows how to delete the row 
with label 'Science':

>>> Re s ul t DF = Re s ul t DF. dr op( ' Sc i e nc e ' ,  a xi s =0)
>>> Re s ul t DF
         Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya  Ma l l i ka
Ma t hs        90     92        89    81      94
Hi ndi        97     96        88    67      99
Engl i s h      95     86        95    80      95 

The following example shows how to delete the 
columns having labels 'Samridhi', 'Ramit' and 'Riya':

 >>> Re s ul t DF = Re s ul t DF. dr op( [ ' Sa mr i dhi ' , ' Ra mi
t ' , ' Ri ya ' ] ,  a xi s =1)
 >>> Re s ul t DF
         Ar na b  Ma l l i ka
Ma t hs        90       94
Hi ndi        97       99
Engl i s h      95       95

 If the DataFrame has more than one row with the 
same label, the DataFrame.drop() method will delete all 
the matching rows from it. For example, consider the 
following DataFrame:  

 
>>> Re s ul t DF

  Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya   Ma l l i ka
Ma t hs      90     92        89    81       94
Sc i e nc e    91     81        91    71       95
Hi ndi      97     96        88    67       99
Hi ndi      97     89        78    60       45

To remove the duplicate rows labelled ‘Hindi’, we 
need to write the following statement:

 >>> Re s u l t DF= Re s ul t DF. dr op( ' Hi ndi ' ,  a x i s =0)
>>> Re s u l t DF

(D) Renaming Row Labels of a DataFrame
We can change the labels of rows and columns in a 
DataFrame using the DataFrame.rename() method. 
Consider the following DataFrame. To rename the row 
indices Maths to sub1, Science to sub2, Hindi to sub3 
and English to sub4 we can write the following statement: 

>>> Re s ul t DF  
  Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya   Ma l l i ka
Ma t hs      90     92        89    81       94
Sc i e nc e    91     81        91    71       95
Engl i s h    97     96        88    67       99
Hi ndi      97     89        78    60       45

Think and Reflect
>>> Re s ul t DF=Re s ul t DF. r e na me ( { ' Ma t hs ' : ' Sub1 ' ,  

What if in the rename ‘ Sc i e nc e ' : ' Sub2 ' , ' Engl i s h ' : ' Sub3 ' ,  
function we pass a 

' Hi ndi ' : ' Sub4 ' } ,  a xi s =' i nde x ' )
value for a row label 

>>> pr i nt ( Re s ul t DF)
that does not exist?

  Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya   Ma l l i ka
Sub1     90     92        89    81       94
Sub2     91     81        91    71       95
Sub3     97     96        88    67       99
Sub4     97     89        78    60       45

  The parameter axis='index' is used to specify that 
the row label is to be changed. If no new label is passed 
corresponding to an existing label, the existing row label 
is left as it is, for example: 

>>> Re s ul t DF=Re s ul t DF. r e na me ( { ' Ma t hs ' : ' Sub1 ' , ‘ S
c i e nc e ' : ' Sub2 ' , ' Hi ndi ' : ' Sub4 ' } ,  a xi s =' i nde x ' )
>>> pr i nt ( Re s ul t DF)

Sub2     91     81        91    71       95
Engl i s h   97     96        88    67       99
Sub4     97     89        78    60       45

(E) Renaming Column Labels of a DataFrame
To alter the column names of ResultDF we can again use 
the rename() method, as shown below. The parameter 
axis='columns' implies we want to change the column 
labels:

 >>> Re s ul t DF=Re s ul t DF. r e na me ( { ' Ar na b ' : ' St ude nt 1 ' , ' Ra mi t ' : ' St ude nt 2 ' , '
Sa mr i dhi ' : ' St ude nt 3 ' , ' Ma l l i ka ' : ' St ude nt 4 ' } , a xi s =' c ol umns ' )
>>> pr i nt ( Rs ul t DF)

Hi ndi           97        89        78    60        45

Note that the column Riya remains unchanged since 
we did not pass any new label.

2.3.3 Accessing DataFrames Element through  Think and Reflect
        Indexing

What would happen if 
Data elements in a DataFrame can be accessed using the label or row index 
indexing.There are two ways of indexing Dataframes : passed is not present 

Label based indexing and Boolean Indexing. in the DataFrame?

(A) Label Based Indexing
There are several methods in Pandas to implement label 
based indexing. DataFrame.loc[ ] is an important method 
that is used for label based indexing with DataFrames. 
Let us continue to use the ResultDF created earlier. 
As shown in the following example, a single row label 
returns the row as a Series.

>>> Re s ul t DF
          Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya   Ma l l i ka  
Ma t hs        90     92        89    81       94     
Sc i e nc e      91     81        91    71       95     
Hi ndi        97     96        88    67       99     

>>> Re s ul t DF. l oc [ ' Sc i e nc e ' ]

Ar na b     91
Ra mi t      81
Sa mr i dhi   91
Ri ya       71
Ma l l i ka    95
Na me :  Sc i e nc e ,  d t ype :  i n t 64

Also, note that when the row label is passed as an 
integer value, it is interpreted as a label of the index and 
not as an integer position along the index, for example:

>>> dFr a me 10Mul t i pl e s  = pd. Da t a Fr a me ( [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50] )

>>> dFr a me 10Mul t i pl e s . l oc [ 2]
0    30
Na me :  2 ,  d t ype :  i n t 64

When a single column label is passed, it returns the column 
as a Series.

>>> Re s ul t DF. l oc [ : , ' Ar na b ' ]

Reprint 2025-26



50 InformatIcs PractIces

notes Ma t hs  90
Sc i e nc e  91
Hi ndi  97
Na me :  Ar na b,  d t ype :  i n t 64

Also, we can obtain the same result that is the marks 
of ‘Arnab’ in all the subjects by using the command:

>>> pr i nt ( df [ ' Ar na b ' ] )

Ma t hs  56
Sc i e nc e  91
Engl i s h  97 Hi ndi  97
Na me :  Ar na b,  d t ype :  i n t 64

To read more than one row from a DataFrame, a list 
of row labels is used as shown below. Note that using [[]] 
returns a DataFrame.

>>> Re s ul t DF. l oc [ [ ' Sc i e nc e ' ,  ' Hi ndi ' ] ]

        Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya   Ma l l i ka  
Sc i e nc e     91     81        91    71       95     
Hi ndi       97     96        88    67       99     

(B) Boolean Indexing
Boolean means a binary variable that can represent 
either of the two states -  True (indicated by 1) or False 
(indicated by 0). In Boolean indexing, we can select 
the subsets of data based on the actual values in the 
DataFrame rather than their row/column labels. Thus, 
we can use conditions on column names to filter data 
values. Consider the DataFrame ResultDF, the following 
statement displays True or False depending on whether 
the data value satisfies the given condition or not.   

>>> Re s ul t DF. l oc [ ' Ma t hs ' ]  > 90
Ar na b       Fa l s e
Ra mi t         Tr ue
Sa mr i dhi     Fa l s e
Ri ya         Fa l s e
Ma l l i ka       Tr ue
Na me :  Ma t hs ,  d t ype :  bool

To check in which subjects ‘Arnab’ has scored more 
than 90, we can write:

>>> Re s ul t DF. l oc [ : , ‘ Ar na b’ ] >90
Ma t hs       Fa l s e
Sc i e nc e      Tr ue
Hi ndi        Tr ue
Na me :  Ar na b,  d t ype :  bool

2.3.4 Accessing DataFrames Element through Slicing

We can use slicing to select a subset of rows and/or 
columns from a DataFrame. To retrieve a set of rows, 

Reprint 2025-26



Data HanDling Using PanDas - i 51

slicing can be used with row labels. For example:
>>> Re s ul t DF. l oc [ ' Ma t hs ' :  ' Sc i e nc e ' ]
        Ar na b  Ra mi t   Sa mr i dhi   Ri ya   Ma l l i ka  
Ma t hs       90     92        89    81       94     
Sc i e nc e     91     81        91    71       95     

Here, the rows with labels Maths and Science are 
displayed. Note that in DataFrames slicing is inclusive Activity 2.8
of the end values. We may use a slice of labels with 
a column name to access values of those rows in that a) Using the DataFrame 

column only. For example, the following statement ResultDF, write the 
statement to access 

displays the rows with label Maths and Science, and 
Marks of Arnab in 

column with label Arnab: Maths.
>>> Re s ul t DF. l oc [ ' Ma t hs ' :  ' Sc i e nc e ' ,  ‘ Ar na b’ ] b) Create a DataFrame 
Ma t hs           90 having 5 rows and 
Sc i e nc e         91 write the statement 
Na me :  Ar na b,  d t ype :  i n t 64 to get the first 4 rows 

of it.
We may use a slice of labels with a slice of column 

names to access values of those rows and columns:

>>> Re s ul t DF. l oc [ ' Ma t hs ' :  ' Sc i e nc e ' ,  ‘ Ar na b’ : ’ Sa mr i dhi ’ ]

       Ar na b   Ra mi t  Sa mr i dhi
Ma t hs              90      92         89
Sc i e nc e            91      81         91

Alternatively, we may use a slice of labels with a list 
of column names to access values of those rows and 
columns:

>>> Re s ul t DF. l oc [ ' Ma t hs ' :  ' Sc i e nc e ' , [ ‘ Ar na b’ , ’ Sa mr i dhi ’ ] ]  

             Ar na b     Sa mr i dhi
Ma t hs            90           89
Sc i e nc e          91           91

Filtering Rows in DataFrames
In DataFrames, Boolean values like True (1) and False 
(0) can be associated with indices. They can also be used 
to filter the records using the DataFrmae.loc[] method. 

In order to select or omit particular row(s), we can use 
a Boolean list specifying ‘True’ for the rows to be shown 
and ‘False’ for the ones to be omitted in the output. For 
example, in the following statement, row having index 
as Science is omitted:

notes 2.3.5 Joining, Merging and Concatenation of  
        DataFrames

(A) Joining
We can use the pandas.DataFrame.append() method to 
merge two DataFrames.  It appends rowsof the second 
DataFrame at the end of the first DataFrame. Columns 
not present in the first DataFrame are added as new 
columns. For example, consider the two DataFrames—
dFrame1 and dFrame2described below. Let us use 
theappend() method to append dFrame2 to dFrame1:

>>> dFr a me 1=pd. Da t a Fr a me ( [ [ 1 ,  2 ,  3] ,  [ 4 ,  5] ,  
[ 6] ] ,  c ol umns =[ ' C1 ' ,  ' C2 ' ,  ' C3 ' ] ,  i nde x=[ ' R1 ' ,  
' R2 ' ,  ' R3 ' ] )
>>> dFr a me 1

R1   1   2 . 0   3 . 0
R2   4   5 . 0   Na N
R3   6   Na N  Na N

>>> dFr a me 2=pd. Da t a Fr a me ( [ [ 10,  20] ,  [ 30] ,  [ 40,  
50] ] ,  c ol umns =[ ' C2 ' ,  ' C5 ' ] ,  i nde x=[ ' R4 ' ,  ' R2 ' ,  
' R5 ' ] )
>>> dFr a me 2
    C2    C5
R4  10  20. 0
R2  30   Na N
R5  40  50. 0

>>> dFr a me 1=dFr a me 1. a ppe nd( dFr a me 2)
>>> dFr a me 1

R2  Na N  30. 0   Na N   Na N
R5  Na N  40. 0   Na N  50. 0

 Alternatively, if we append dFrame1 to dFrame2, the 
rows of dFrame2 precede the rows of dFrame1. To get 
the column labels appear in sorted order we can set the 
parameter sort=True. The column labels shall appear in 
unsorted order when the parameter sort = False.

# a ppe nd dFr a me 1 t o  dFr a me 2

The parameter verify_integrity of append()method 
may be set to True when we want to raise an error if the 
row labels are duplicate. By default, verify_integrity = 
False. That is why we could append the duplicate row 
with label R2 when appending the two DataFrames, as 
shown above.

The parameter ignore_index of append()method may 
be set to True, when we do not want to use row index 
labels. By default, ignore_index = False.
>>> dFrame1 = dFrame1.append(dFrame2, ignore_ Think and Reflect
i nde x=Tr ue )
>>> dFr a me 1 How can you check 
    C1    C2   C3    C5 whether a given

4  Na N  30. 0   Na N   Na N
5  Na N  40. 0   Na N  50. 0

 The append()method can also be used to append a 
series or a dictionary to a DataFrame.

2.3.6 Attributes of DataFrames

Like Series, we can access certain properties called 
attributes of a DataFrame by using that property with 
the DataFrame name. Table 2.4 lists some attributes of 
Pandas DataFrame. We are going to use a part of the 
data from a report called “STATE OF FOREST REPORT 
2017”, Published by Forest Survey of India, accessible 
at http://fsi.nic.in/forest-report-2017, as our example

2.4  ImPortIng and exPortIng data between csV 

FILes and dataFrames

We can create a DataFrame by importing data from CSV 
files where values are separated by commas. Similarly, 
we can also store or export data in a DataFrame as a 
.csv file.
2.4.1 Importing a CSV file to a DataFrame
Let us assume that we have the following data in a csv file 
named ResultData.csv stored in the folder C:/NCERT. 
In order to practice the code while we progress, you are 
suggested to create this csv file using a spreadsheet and 
save in your computer.

56 InformatIcs PractIces

notes We can load the data from the ResultData.csv file 
into a DataFrame, say marks using Pandas read_csv() 
function as shown below:
>>> marks = pd.read_csv("C:/NCERT/ResultData.
c s v" , s e p =" , " ,  he a de r =0)
>>> ma r ks
   Rol l No      Na me    Ec o      Ma t hs

4       5    Aa r oos h    18        27

• The first parameter to the read_csv() is the name of 
the comma separated data file along with its path. 

• The parameter sep specifies whether the values are 
separated by comma, semicolon, tab, or any other 
character. The default value for sepis a space. 

• The parameter header specifies the number of the row 
whose values are to be used as the column names. It 
also marks the start of the data to be fetched. header=0 
implies that column names are inferred from the first 
line of the file. By default, header=0.
We can exclusively specify column names using the 

parameter names while creating the DataFrame using 
the read_csv() function. For example, in the following 
statement, names parameter is used to specify the 
labels for columns of the DataFrame marks1: 
>>> marks1 = pd.read_csv("C:/NCERT/ResultData1.
c s v" , s e p=" , " ,  
  na me s =[ ' RNo' , ' St ude nt Na me ' ,  ' Sub1 ' ,  
' Sub2 ' ] )

2.4.2 Exporting a DataFrame to a CSV file
We can use the to_csv() function to save a DataFrame 
to a text or csv file. For example, to save the DataFrame 
ResultDF created in the previous section; we can use 
the following statement:

If two series are not aligned, NaN or missing values There is no concept of NaN values and if there

fails.

Series require more memory. NumPy occupies lesser memory.

Summary

• NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib are Python 
libraries for scientific and analytical use. 

• pip install pandas is the command to install 
Pandas library.

• A data structure is a collection of data values 
and the operations that can be applied to that 
data. It enables efficient storage, retrieval and 
modification to the data. 

• Two main data structures in Pandas library 
are Series and DataFrame. To use these 
data structures, we first need to import the 
Pandas library.

• A Series is a one-dimensional array containing a 
sequence of values. Each value has a data label 
associated with it also called its index. 

• The two common ways of accessing the elements 
of a series are Indexing and Slicing.

• There are two types of indexes: positional index 
and labelled index. Positional index takes an 
integer value that corresponds to its position in 
the series starting from 0, whereas labelled index 
takes any user-defined label as index.

• When positional indices are used for slicing, the 
value at end index position is excluded, i.e., only 
(end -  start) number of data values of the series 
are extracted. However with labelled indexes the

notes
value at the end index label is also included in 
the output. 

• All basic mathematical operations can be 
performed on Series either by using the 
operator or by using appropriate methods of the 
Series object. 

• While performing mathematical operations index 
matching is implemented and if no matching 
indexes are found during alignment, Pandas 
returns NaN so that the operation does not fail.

• A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data 
structure like a spreadsheet. It contains rows 
and columns and therefore has both a row and 
column index.

• When using a dictionary to create a DataFrame, 
keys of the Dictionary become the column labels 
of the DataFrame. A DataFrame can be thought of 
as a dictionary of lists/ Series (all Series/columns 
sharing the same index label for a row).

• Data can be loaded in a DataFrame from a file on 
the disk by using Pandas read_csv function.

• Data in a DataFrame can be written to a text 
file on disk by using the pandas.DataFrame.to_
csv()  function.

• DataFrame.T gives the transpose of a DataFrame. 
• Pandas haves a number of methods that support 

label based indexing but every label asked for 
must be in the index, or a KeyError will be raised. 

• DataFrame.loc[ ] is used for label based indexing 
of rows in DataFrames. 

• Pandas.DataFrame.append() method is used to 
merge two DataFrames. 

• Pandas supports non-unique index values. Only 
if a particular operation that does not support 
duplicate index values is attempted, an exception 
is raised at that time.

• The basic difference between Pandas Series and 
NumPy ndarray is that operations between Series 
automatically align the data based on labels. Thus, 
we can write computations without considering 
whether all Series involved have the same label or 
not whereas in case of ndarrays it raises an error.

Case Study
Let us consider the data of marks scored in unit tests 
held in school. For each unit test, the marks scored by 
all students of the class is recorded. Maximum marks 

 
are 25 in each subject. The subjects are Maths, Science. 
Social Studies (S.St.), Hindi, and English. For simplicity, 
we assume there are 4 students in the class and the 
table below shows their marks in Unit Test 1, Unit Test 
2 and Unit Test 3. Table 3.1 shows this data.

3.2 descrIptIve statIstIcs

Descriptive Statistics are used to summarise the given 
data. In other words, they refer to the methods which 
are used to get some basic idea  about the data. 

In this section, we will be discussing descriptive 
statistical methods that can be applied to a DataFrame. 
These are max, min, count, sum, mean, median, mode, 
quartiles, variance. In each case, we will consider the 
above created DataFrame df.

3.2.1 Calculating Maximum Values

DataFrame.max() is used to calculate the maximum 
values from the DataFrame, regardless of its data types. 
The following statement outputs the maximum value of 
each column of the DataFrame:

>>> print(df.max())

Name       Zuhaire  #Maximum value in name column          
                         #(alphabetically)

UT               3  #Maximum value in column UT 

Maths           24  #Maximum value in column Maths

Science         25  #Maximum value in column Science

S.St            25  #Maximum value in column S.St

Hindi           25  #Maximum value in column Hindi

Eng             24  #Maximum value in column Eng

dtype: object

If we want to output maximum value for the columns 
having only numeric values, then we can set the 
parameter numeric_only=True in the max() method, as 
shown below:

Program 3-2  Write the statements to output the 
maximum marks obtained in each subject 
in Unit Test 2. 

>>> dfUT2 = df[df.UT == 2]

>>> print('\nResult of Unit Test 2: 
\n\n',dfUT2)

Result of Unit Test 2:

10   Mishti   2     18       21    25     24   23
The output of Program 

3.2 can also be 
achieved using the >>> print('\nMaximum Mark obtained in 

following statements Each Subject in Unit Test 2: \n\n',dfUT2.
max(numeric_only=True))

>>> dfUT2=df[df 
['UT']==2].max

By default, the max() method finds the maximum 
value of each column (which means, axis=0). However, 
to find the maximum value of each row, we have to 
specify axis = 1 as its argument.

test among all the subjects

Note: In most of the python function calls, axis = 0 refers 
to row wise operations and axis = 1 refers to column wise 
operations. But in the call of max(), axis = 1 gives row wise 
output and axis = 0 (default case) gives column-wise output. 
Similar is the case with all statistical operations discussed 
in this chapter.

3.2.2 Calculating Minimum Values 

DataFrame.min() is used to display the minimum values 
from the DataFrame, regardless of the data types. That 
is, it shows the minimum value of each column or row. 
The following line of code output the minimum value of 
each column of the DataFrame:

>>> print(df.min())

The output of Program 
3.3 can also be Minimum Marks obtained by Mishti in each subject

column UT, we mentioned all the other column names for 
which minimum is to be calculated.

3.2.3 Calculating Sum of Values

DataFrame.sum() will display the sum of the values 
from the DataFrame regardless of its datatype. The 
following line of code outputs the sum of each column 
of the DataFrame:

>>> print(df.sum())

3.4 sortIng a dataFrame

Sorting refers to the arrangement of data elements in 
a specified order, which can either be ascending or 
descending. Pandas provide sort_values() function to 
sort the data values of a DataFrame. The syntax of the 
function is as follows:

DataFrame.sort_values(by, axis=0, ascending=True)

Here, a column list (by), axis arguments (0 for rows 
and 1 for columns) and the order of sorting (ascending 
= False or True) are passed as arguments. By default, 
sorting is done on row indexes in ascending order.

 Consider a scenario, where the teacher is interested 
in arranging a list according to the names of the students 
or according to marks obtained in a particular subject. 
In such cases, sorting can be used to obtain the desired 
results. Following is the python code for sorting the data 
in the DataFrame created at program 3.1.

To sort the entire data on the basis of attribute 
‘Name’, we use the following command:

#By default, sorting is done in ascending order. 

>>> print(df.sort_values(by=['Name']))

       Name  UT  Maths  Science  S.St  Hindi  Eng

Now, to obtain sorted list of marks scored by all 
students in Science in Unit Test 2, the following code 
can be used:

# Get the data corresponding to Unit Test 2

>>> dfUT2 = df[df.UT == 2]

# Sort according to ascending order of marks in 
Science

A DataFrame can be sorted based on multiple 
columns. Following is the code of sorting the DataFrame 
df based on marks in Science in Unit Test 3 in ascending 
order. If marks in Science are the same, then sorting 
will be done on the basis of marks in Hindi.

# Get the data corresponding to marks in Unit Test 
3

>>> dfUT3 = df[df.UT == 3]

# Sort the data according to Science and then 
according to Hindi

Here, we can see that the list is sorted on the basis 
of marks in Science. Two students namely, Zuhaire and 
Mishti have equal marks (18) in Science. Therefore for 
them, sorting is done on the basis of marks in Hindi.

3.5 group BY FunctIons notes

In pandas, DataFrame.GROUP BY() function is used 
to split the data into groups based on some criteria. 
Pandas objects like a DataFrame can be split on any 
of their axes. The GROUP BY function works based on 
a split-apply-combine strategy which is shown below 
using a 3-step process:

Step 1: Split the data into groups by creating a GROUP 
BY object from the original DataFrame.

Step 2: Apply the required function. 

Step 3: Combine the results to form a new DataFrame. 

To understand this better, let us consider the data 
shown in the diagram given below. Here, we have a two-
column DataFrame (key, data). We need to find the sum 
of the data column for a particular key, i.e. sum of all 
the data elements with key A, B and C, respectively. To 
do so, we first split the entire DataFrame into groups 
by key column. Then, we apply the sum function on the 
respective groups. Finally, we combine the results to 
form a new DataFrame that contains the desired result.

The above statements show how we create groups by 
splitting a DataFrame using GROUP BY(). Next step is 
to apply functions over the groups just created. This is 
done using Aggregation. 

Aggregation is a process in which an aggregate 
function is applied on each group created by GROUP 
BY(). It returns a single aggregated statistical value 
corresponding to each group. It can be used to apply 
multiple functions over an axis. Be default, functions 
are applied over columns. Aggregation can be performed 
using agg() or aggregate() function.

We use indexing to access the elements of a DataFrame. 
It is used for fast retrieval of data. By default, a numeric 
index starting from 0 is created as a row index, as shown 
below:

>>> df    #With default Index

11   Mishti   3     17       18    20     25   20

Here, the integer number in the first column 
starting from 0 is the index. However, depending on our 
requirements, we can select  some other column to be 
the index or we can add another index column. 

When we slice the data, we get the original index 
which is not continuous, e.g. when we select marks of 
all students in Unit Test 1, we get the following result:

>>> dfUT1 = df[df.UT == 1]

>>> print(dfUT1)

3.7 other dataFrame operatIons

In this section, we will learn more techniques and 
functions that can be used to manipulate and analyse 
data in a DataFrame.

3.7.1 Reshaping Data

The way a dataset is arranged into rows and columns is 
referred to as the shape of data. Reshaping data refers 
to the process of changing the shape of the dataset 
to make it suitable for some analysis problems. The 
example given in the below section explains the utility 
of reshaping the data.

For reshaping data, two basic functions are available 
in Pandas, pivot and pivot_table. This section covers 
them in detail.

(A) Pivot 
The pivot function is used to reshape and create a new 
DataFrame from the original one. Consider the following 
example of sales and profit data of four stores: S1, S2, 
S3 and S4 for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. 

Example 3.1 
>>> import pandas as pd

>>> data={'Store':['S1','S4','S3','S1','S2','S3
','S1','S2','S3'], 'Year':[2016,2016,2016,2017
,2017,2017,2018,2018,2018],

'Total_sales(Rs)':[12000,330000,420000, 
20000,10000,450000,30000, 11000,89000],
'Total_profit(
Rs)':[1100,5500,21000,32000,9000,45000,3000, 
1900,23000]
}
      
>>> df=pd.DataFrame(data)
>>> print(df)

           
   Store    Year    Total_sales(Rs)     Total_profit(Rs)
0    S1     2016            12000              1100
1    S4     2016           330000              5500
2    S3     2016           420000             21000

3    S1     2017            20000             32000
4    S2     2017            10000              9000
5    S3     2017           450000             45000
6    S1     2018            30000              3000
7    S2     2018            11000              1900
8    S3     2018            89000             23000

Let us try to answer the following queries on the 
above data.

1) What was the total sale of store S1 in all the years? 
Python statements to perform this task will be 
as follows:

    # will get the data related to store S1

>>> S1df = df[df.Store==’S1’]

#find the total of sales for Store S1
>>> S1df[‘Total_sales(Rs)’].sum()

62000

2) What is the maximum sale value by store S3 in 
any year? 

#will get the data related to store S3

>>> S3df = df[df.Store==’S3’]

#find the maximum sale for Store S3
>>> S3df[‘Total_sales(Rs)’].max() 

450000

3) Which store had the maximum total sale in all 
the years?

>>> S1df = df[df.Store=='S1']  

>>> S2df=df[df.Store == 'S2']  

>>> S3df = df[df.Store=='S3']   

>>> S4df = df[df.Store=='S4']  

>>> S1total = S1df['Total_sales(Rs)'].sum()

>>> S2total = S2df['Total_sales(Rs)'].sum()

  >>> S3total = S3df['Total_sales(Rs)'].sum()

  >>> S4total = S4df['Total_sales(Rs)'].sum()

 >>> max(S1total,S2total,S3total,S4total)

 959000

Notice that we have to slice the data corresponding to 
a particular store and then answer the query. Now, let 
us reshape the data using pivot and see the difference.

>>>

pivot1=df.pivot(index='Store',columns='Year',va
lues='Total_sales(Rs)')

Here, Index specifies the columns that will be acting 
as an index in the pivot table, columns specifies the 
new columns for the pivoted data and values specifies 
columns whose values will be displayed. In this 
particular case, store names will act as index, year 
will be the headers for columns and sales value will be 
displayed as values of the pivot table.      

>>> print(pivot1)
           

Year       2016      2017     2018
Store                             
S1      12000.0   20000.0  30000.0
S2          NaN   10000.0  11000.0
S3     420000.0  450000.0  89000.0
S4     330000.0       NaN      NaN

As can be seen above, the value of Total_sales (Rs) 
for every row in the original table has been transferred 
to the new table: pivot1, where each row has data of a 
store and each column has data of a year. Those cells in 
the new pivot table which do not have a matching entry 
in the original one are filled with NaN. For instance, we 
did not have values corresponding to sales of Store S2 
in 2016, thus the appropriate cell in pivot1 is filled with 
NaN. 

Now the python statements for the above queries will 
be as follows:

1) What was the total sale of store S1 in all the years? 
  >>> pivot1.loc[‘S1’].sum()

2) What is the maximum sale value by store S3 in 
any year? 

  >>> pivot1.loc[‘S3’].max()

3) Which store had the maximum total sale?
 >>> S1total = pivot1.loc['S1'].sum()

 >>> S2total = pivot1.loc['S2'].sum()

 >>> S3total = pivot1.loc['S3'].sum()

 >>> S4total = pivot1.loc['S4'].sum()

 >>> max(S1total,S2total,S3total,S4total)

Let us consider another example, where suppose we 
have stock data corresponding to a store as:

>>> data={'Item':['Pen','Pen','Pencil','Pencil'
,'Pen','Pen'],

'Color':['Red','Red','Black','Black','Blue','B
lue'],

'Price(Rs)':[10,25,7,5,50,20],

'Units_in_stock':[50,10,47,34,55,14]

}           

>>> df=pd.DataFrame(data)          

>>> print(df)

     Item  Color  Price(Rs)  Units_in_stock

0     Pen    Red         10              50

1     Pen    Red         25              10

2  Pencil  Black          7              47

3  Pencil  Black          5              34

4     Pen   Blue         50              55

5     Pen   Blue         20              14

Now, let us assume, we have to reshape the above 
table with Item as the index and Color as the column. 
We will use pivot function as given below:
>>> pivot3=df.pivot(index='Item',columns='Color
',values='Units_in_stock')

But this statement results in an error: “ValueError: 
Index contains duplicate entries, cannot reshape”. This 
is because duplicate data can’t be reshaped using pivot 
function. Hence, before calling the pivot() function, we 
need to ensure that our data do not have rows with 
duplicate values for the specified columns. If we can’t 
ensure this, we may have to use pivot_table function 
instead.

(C) Pivot Table
It works like a pivot function, but aggregates the values 
from rows with duplicate entries for the specified 
columns. In other words, we can use aggregate functions 
like min, max, mean etc, wherever we have duplicate 
entries. The default aggregate function is mean.

Syntax: 
pandas.pivot_table(data, values=None, 
index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean')

The parameter aggfunc can have values among sum, 
max, min, len, np.mean, np.median.

We can apply index to multiple columns if we don't 
have any unique column to act as index. 

>>> df1 = df.pivot_
table(index=['Item','Color'])
>>> print(df1)
              Price(Rs)  Units_in_stock
Item   Color                           
Pen    Blue        35.0            34.5
       Red         17.5            30.0

Pencil Black        6.0            40.5

Please note that mean has been used as the default 
aggregate function. Price of the blue pen in the original 
data is 50 and 20. Mean has been used as aggregate 
and the price of the blue pen is 35 in df1.  

We can use multiple aggregate functions on the 
data. Below example shows the use of the sum, max 
and np.mean function.

>>> pivot_table1=df.pivot_table(index='
Item',columns='Color',values='Units_in_
stock',aggfunc=[sum,max,np.mean])

>>> pivot_table1
        

                sum                    max                 mean            

Color    Black  Blue   Red     Black  Blue   Red    Black  Blue   Red

Item                                                        

Pen      NaN    69.0   60.0    NaN    55.0   50.0   NaN    34.5  30.0

Pencil  81.0     NaN   NaN     47.0   NaN    NaN    40.5   NaN   NaN

Pivoting can also be done on multiple columns. 
Further, different aggregate functions can be applied on 
different columns. The following example demonstrates 
pivoting on two columns - Price(Rs) and Units_in_stock. 
Also, the application of len() function on the column

Price(Rs) and mean() function of column Units_in_ notes
stock is shown in the example. Note that the aggregate 
function len returns the number of rows corresponding 
to that entry.

>>> pivot_table1=df.pivot_table(index='Item'
,columns='Color',values=['Price(Rs)','Units_
in_stock'],aggfunc={"Price(Rs)":len,"Units_in_
stock":np.mean})

>>> pivot_table1

               Price(Rs)        Units_in_stock   

Color      Black Blue  Red    Black  Blue   Red

Item                                                 

Pen          NaN  2.0  2.0      NaN  34.5  30.0

Pencil       2.0  NaN  NaN     40.5   NaN   NaN

Program 3-11 Write the statement to print the maximum 
price of pen of each color.

3.8 handlIng mIssIng values

As we know that a DataFrame  can consist of many rows 
(objects) where each row can have values for various 
columns (attributes). If a value corresponding to a 
column is not present, it is considered to be a missing 
value. A missing value is denoted by NaN.

In the real world dataset, it is common for an object 
to have some missing attributes. There may be several 
reasons for that. In some cases, data was not collected 
properly resulting in missing data e.g some people did 
not fill all the fields while taking the survey. Sometimes, 
some attributes are not relevant to all. For example, if 
a person is unemployed then salary attribute will be 
irrelevant and hence may not have been filled up.

notes Missing values create a lot of problems during data 
analysis and have to be handled properly. The two 
most common strategies for handling missing values 
explained in this section are:

i)  drop the object having missing values, 
ii) fill or estimate the missing value 
Let us refer to the previous case study given at table 

3.1. Suppose, the students have now appeared for 
Unit Test 4 also. But, Raman could not appear for the 
Science, Maths and English tests, and suppose there 
is no possibility of a re-test. Therefore, marks obtained 
by him corresponding to these subjects will be missing. 
The dataset after Unit Test 4 is as shown at Table 3.2. 
Note that the attributes ‘Science, ‘Maths’ and ‘English’ 
have missing values in Unit Test 4 for Raman.

To calculate the final result, teachers are asked to 
submit the percentage of marks obtained by all students. 
In the case of Raman, the Maths teacher decides to 
compute the marks obtained in 3 tests and then find the 
percentage of marks from the total score of 75 marks. 
In a way, she decides to drop the marks of Unit Test 4. 
However, the English teacher decides to give the same

marks to Raman in the 4th test as scored in the 3rd 
test. Science teacher decides to give Raman zero marks 
in the 4th test and then computes the percentage of 
marks obtained. Following sections explain the code 
for checking missing values and the code for replacing 
those missing values with appropriate values.

3.8.1 Checking Missing Values

Pandas provide a function isnull() to check whether any 
value is missing or not in the DataFrame. This function 
checks all attributes and returns True in case that 
attribute has missing values, otherwise returns False.

The following code stores the data of marks of all 
the Unit Tests in a DataFrame and checks whether the 
DataFrame has missing values or not.

>>> marksUT = {

3.8.2 Dropping Missing Values

Missing values can be handled by either dropping the 
entire row having missing value or replacing it with 
appropriate value.

Dropping will remove the entire row (object) having 
the missing value(s). This strategy reduces the size of 
the dataset used in data analysis, hence should be used 
in case of missing values on few objects. The dropna() 
function can be used to drop an entire row from the 
DataFrame. For example, calling dropna() function on

Note that the number of rows in dfRaman is 3 after 
using dropna. Hence percentage is computed from 
marks obtained in 3 Unit Tests. 

3.8.3 Estimating Missing Values

Missing values can be filled by using estimations or 
approximations e.g a value just before (or after) the 
missing value, average/minimum/maximum of the 
values of that attribute, etc. In some cases, missing 
values are replaced by zeros (or ones).

The fillna(num) function can be used to replace 
missing value(s) by the value specified in num. For 
example, fillna(0) replaces missing value by 0. Similarly 
fillna(1) replaces missing value by 1. Following code 
replaces missing values by 0 and computes the 
percentage of marks scored by Raman in Science.

notes information and replacing missing values by some 
estimation will surely change the dataset. In all cases, 
data analysis results will not be actual results but will 
be a good approximation of actual results.

3.9  Import and export oF data Between pandas 
and mYsQl

So far, we have directly entered data and created 
a DataFrame and learned how to analyse data in a 
DataFrame. However, in actual scenarios, data need 
not be typed or copy pasted everytime. Rather, data is 
available most of the time in a file (text or csv) or in 
a database. Thus, in real-world scenarios, we will be 
required to bring data directly from a database and load 
to a DataFrame. This is called importing data from a 
database. Likewise, after analysis, we will be required to 
store data back to a database. This is called exporting 
data to a database.

Data from DataFrame can be read from and written 
to MySQL database. To do this, a connection is required 
with the MySQL database using the pymysql database 
driver. And for this, the driver should be installed in the 
python environment using the following command: 

pip install pymysql

 
sqlalchemy is a library used to interact with the 

MySQL database by providing the required credentials. 
This library can be installed using the following 
command:

pip install sqlalchemy

Once it is installed, sqlalchemy provides a function 
create_engine() that enables this connection to be 
established. The string inside the function is known as 
connection string. The connection string is composed of 
multiple parameters like the name of the database with 
which we want to establish the connection, username, 
password, host, port number and finally the name of 
the database. And, this function returns an engine 
object based on this connection string. The syntax for 
the same is discussed below:

engine=create_engine('driver://
username:password@host:port/name_of_
database',index=false)

 where, 
Driver = mysql+pymysql
username=User name of the mysql (normally it is root)
password= Password of the MySql
port = usually we connect to localhost with port number 
3306 (Default port number)
Name of the Database = Your database

In the following subsections, importing and exporting 
data between Pandas and MySQL applications are 
demonstrated. For this, we will use the same database

3.9.1 Importing Data from MySQL to Pandas

Importing data from MySQL to pandas basically refers 
to the process of reading a table from MySQL database 
and loading it to a pandas DataFrame. After establishing 
the connection, in order to fetch data from the table of 
the database we have the following three functions:

1) pandas.read_sql_query(query,sql_conn)

It is used to read an sql query (query) into a 
DataFrame using the connection identifier (sql_
conn) returned from the create_engine ().

2) pandas.read_sql_table(table_name,sql_conn)

It is used to read an sql table (table_name) into a 
DataFrame using the connection identifier (sql_
conn).

3) pandas.read_sql(sql, sql_conn)

It is used to read either an sql query or an sql 
table (sql) into a DataFrame using the connection 
identifier (sql_conn).

3.9.2 Exporting Data from Pandas to MySQL

Exporting data from Pandas to MySQL basically refers 
to the process of writing a pandas DataFrame to a table 
of MySQL database. For this purpose, we have the 
following function:

pandas.DataFrame.to_sql(table,sql_conn,if_
exists=”fail”,index=False/True)

• Table specifies the name of the table in which we 
want to create or append DataFrame values. It is 
used to write the specified DataFrame to the table 
the connection identifier (sql_conn) returned from the 
create_engine (). 

• The parameter if_exists specifies “the way data from 
the DataFrame should be entered in the table. It 
can have the following three values: “fail”, “replace”, 
“append”. 
ο “fail” is the default value that indicates a 

ValueError if the table already exists in the 
database. 

ο “replace” specifies that the previous content of 
the table should be updated by the contents of 
the DataFrame. 

ο “append” specifies that the contents of the 
DataFrame should be appended to the existing 
table and when updated the format must be the 
same (column name sequences).

• Index — By default index is True means DataFrame notes
index will be copied to MySQL table. If False, then it

>>> df=pd.DataFrame(data)

>>> df.to_sql('showroom_info',engine,if_

After running this python script, a mysql table 
with the name “showroom_info” will be created in the 
database.

Summary

• Descriptive Statistics are used to quantitatively 
summarise the given data.

• Pandas provide many statistical functions for 
analysis of data. Some of the functions are max(), 
min(), mean(), median(), mode(), std(), var() etc.

• Sorting is used to arrange data in a specified 
order, i.e. either ascending or descending.

• Indexes or labels of a row or column can be 
changed in a DataFrame. This process is known 
as Altering the index. Two functions reset_index 
and set_index are used for that purpose. 

• Missing values are a hindrance in data analysis 
and must be handled properly.

• There are primarily two main strategies for 
handling missing data. Either the row (or column) 
having missing value is removed completely from 
analysis or missing value is replaced by some

notes
appropriate value (which may be zero or one or 
average etc.)

• Process of changing the structure of the DataFrame 
is known as Reshaping. Pandas provide two basic 
functions for this, pivot() and pivot_table().

• pymysql and sqlalchemy are two mandatory 
libraries for facilitating import and export of data 
between Pandas and MySQL. Before import and 
export, a connection needs to be established from 
python script to MySQL database. 

• Importing data from MySQL to Panda refers to 
the process of fetching data from a MySQL table 
or database to a pandas DataFrame. 

• Exporting data from Pandas to MySQL refers to the 
process of storing data from a pandas DataFrame 
to a MySQL table or database.

UCI dataset is a collection of open datasets, available 
to the public for experimentation and research 
purposes. ‘auto-mpg’ is one such open dataset. 

It contains data related to fuel consumption by 
automobiles in a city. Consumption is measured in 
miles per gallon (mpg), hence the name of the dataset 
is auto-mpg. The data has 398 rows (also known as 
items or instances or objects) and  nine columns 
(also known as attributes). 

The attributes are: mpg, cylinders, displacement, 
horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin, 
car name. Three attributes, cylinders, model year 
and origin have categorical values, car name is a 
string with a unique value for every row, while the 
remaining five attributes have numeric value.

The data has been downloaded from the UCI data 
repository available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/
ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/.

Following are the exercises to analyse the data.

1) Load auto-mpg.data into a DataFrame autodf.

2) Give description of the generated DataFrame 
autodf.

plotting area, legend, axis labels, ticks, title, etc. (Figure notes
4.1). Each function makes some change to a figure: 
example, creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a 
figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the 
plot with labels, etc. 

It is always expected that the data presented through 
charts easily understood. Hence, while presenting data 
we should always give a chart title, label the axis of the 
chart and provide legend in case we have more than one 
plotted data.

To plot x versus y, we can write plt.plot(x,y). The 
show() function is used to display the figure created 
using the plot() function.

Let us consider that in a city, the maximum temperature 
of a day is recorded for three consecutive days. Program 
4-1 demonstrates how to plot temperature values for 
the given dates. The output generated is a line chart.

Program 4-1 Plotting Temperature against Height

In program 4-1,  plot() is provided with two parameters, 
which indicates values for x-axis and y-axis, respectively. 
The x and y ticks are displayed accordingly. As shown 
in Figure 4.2, the plot() function by default plots a line 
chart. We can click on the save button on the output 
window and save the plot as an image. A figure can also 
be saved by using savefig() function. The name of the 
figure is passed to the function as parameter. 

For example: plt.savefig('x.png'). 
In the previous example, we used plot() function 

to plot a line graph. There are different types of data 
available for analysis. The plotting methods allow for a 
handful of plot types other than the default line plot, as 
listed in Table 4.1. Choice of plot is determined by the 
type of data we have. 

Table 4.1 List of Pyplot functions to plot different charts

plot(\*args[, scalex, scaley, data]) Plot x versus y as lines and/or markers.

bar(x, height[, width, bottom, align, data]) Make a bar plot.

boxplot(x[, notch, sym, vert, whis, ...]) Make a box and whisker plot.

Pyplot library gives us numerous functions, which can 
be used to customise charts such as adding titles or 
legends. Some of the customisation options are listed in 
Table 4.2:

4.3.1 Marker

We can make certain other changes to plots by passing 
various parameters to the plot() function. In Figure 
4.3, we plot temperatures day-wise. It is also possible 
to specify each point in the line through a marker.

A marker is any symbol that represents a data value 
in a line chart or a scatter plot. Table 4.3 shows a list 
of markers along with their corresponding symbol and 
description. These markers can be used in program codes:

It is also possible to format the plot further by changing 
the colour of the plotted data. Table 4.4 shows the list of 
colours that are supported. We can either use character 
codes or the color names as values to the parameter 
color in the plot().

4.3.3 Linewidth and Line Style

The linewidth and linestyle property can be used 
to change the width and the style of the line chart. 
Linewidth is specified in pixels. The default line width 
is 1 pixel showing a thin line. Thus, a number greater 
than 1 will output a thicker line depending on the 
value provided. 

We can also set the line style of a line chart using 
the linestyle parameter. It can take a string such as 
"solid", "dotted", "dashed" or "dashdot". Let us write the 
Program 4-3 applying some of the customisations.

Program 4-3   Consider the average heights and weights of 
persons aged 8 to 16 stored in the following 
two lists:

height = [121.9,124.5,129.5,134.6,139.7,147.3, 
152.4, 157.5,162.6]

weight= [19.7,21.3,23.5,25.9,28.5,32.1,35.7,39.6, 
43.2]

Let us plot a line chart where:

i. x axis will represent weight

ii. y axis will represent height

iii. x axis label should be “Weight in kg”

iv. y axis label should be “Height in cm”

v. colour of the line should be green

vi. use * as marker

vii. Marker size as10

viii. The title of the chart should be “Average 
weight with respect to average height”.

ix. Line style should be dashed

x. Linewidth should be 2.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

import pandas as pd

height=[121.9,124.5,129.5,134.6,139.7,147.3,152.4,157.5,162.6]

weight=[19.7,21.3,23.5,25.9,28.5,32.1,35.7,39.6,43.2]

df=pd.DataFrame({"height":height,"weight":weight})

#Set xlabel for the plot

plt.xlabel('Weight in kg')

#Set ylabel for the plot

#Set chart title:

#plot using marker'-*' and line colour as green

plt.plot(df.weight,df.height,marker='*',markersize=10,color='green
',linewidth=2, linestyle='dashdot')

plt.show()

In the above we created the DataFrame using 2 lists, 
and in the plot function we have passed the height and 
weight columns of the DataFrame. The output is shown 
in Figure 4.4.

Continuous data 
are measured 
while discrete 
data are obtained 
by counting. 
Height, weight 
are examples of 
continuous data. It 
can be in decimals. 
Total number 
of students in a 
class is discrete. 
It can never be in 
decimals.

4.4  the Pandas Plot functIon (Pandas 
VIsualIsatIon)

In Programs 4-1 and 4-2, we learnt that the plot() 
function of the pyplot module of matplotlib can be used 
to plot a chart. However, starting from version 0.17.0, 
Pandas objects Series and DataFrame come equipped 
with their own .plot() methods. This plot() method is just 
a simple wrapper around the plot() function of pyplot. 
Thus, if we have a Series or DataFrame type object (let's 
say 's' or 'df') we can call the plot method by writing:

s.plot() or df.plot()

Plotting Data using MatPlotlib 113

The plot() method of Pandas accepts a considerable 
number of arguments that can be used to plot a variety 
of graphs. It allows customising different plot types by 
supplying the kind keyword arguments. The general 
syntax is: plt.plot(kind),where kind accepts a string 
indicating the type of .plot, as listed in Table 4.5. In 
addition, we can use the matplotlib.pyplot methods 
and functions also along with the plt() method of 
 Pandas objects.

In the previous chapters, we have learned to store

Figure 4.5: Line plot showing mela sales figures

The line plot takes a numeric value to display on 
the x axis and hence uses the index (row labels) of the 
DataFrame in the above example. Thus, x tick values 
are the index of the DataFramedf that contains data 
stored in MelaSales.CSV.

Customising Line Plot
We can substitute the ticks at x axis with a list of values 
of our choice by using plt.xticks(ticks,label) where 
ticks is a list of locations(locs) on x axis at which ticks 
should be placed, label is a list of items to place at the 
given ticks.

weekends, it also shows that the sales increased on 
Wednesday for Week 1, on Thursday for Week 2 and on 
Tuesday for Week 3.

But, the lines are unable to efficiently depict 
comparison between the weeks for which the sales data 
is plotted. In order to show comparisons, we prefer Bar 
charts. Unlike line plots, bar charts can plot strings on 
the x axis. To plot a bar chart, we will specify kind=’bar’. 
We can also specify the DataFrame columns to be used 
as x and y axes.

Histograms are column-charts, where each column Bins are the

corresponds to how many values are in that range. you want to divide 

To make a histogram, the data is sorted into all of your data into, 
such that it can be 

"bins" and the number of data points in each bin is 
displayed as bars 

counted. The height of each column in the histogram on a histogram. 
is then proportional to the number of data points its 
bin contains. 

The df.plot(kind=’hist’) function automatically selects 
the size of the bins based on the spread of values in 
the data. 
Program 4-8 

import pandas as pd

import  matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = {'Name':['Arnav', 'Sheela', 'Azhar', 'Bincy', 'Yash', 
'Nazar'], 

'Height' : [60,61,63,65,61,60], 

'Weight' : [47,89,52,58,50,47]}

df.plot(kind='hist') How can we make the 
bar chart of Figure 4.8

The Program 4-9 displays the histogram corresponding 
to all attributes having numeric values, i.e., ‘Height’ 
and ‘Weight’ attributes as shown in Figure 4.9. On the 
basis of the height and weight values provided in the 
DataFrame, the plot() calculated the bin values.

df.plot(kind='hist',bins=range(18,25))

Customising Histogram
Taking the same data as above, now let see how the 
histogram can be customised. Let us change the 
edgecolor, which is the border of each hist, to green. 
Also, let us change the line style to ":" and line width 
to 2. Let us try another property called fill, which takes 
boolean values. The default True means each hist will 
be filled with color and False means each hist will be 
empty. Another property called hatch can be used to fill 
to each hist with pattern ( '-', '+', 'x', '\\', '*', 'o', 'O', '.'). In 
the Program 4-10, we have used the hatch value as "o". 

Program 4-9

4.4.4 Plotting Scatter Chart

A scatter chart is a two-dimensional data visualisation 
method that uses dots to represent the values obtained 
for two different variables —one plotted along the x-axis 
and the other plotted along the y-axis. 
Scatter plots are used when you want to show the 
relationship between two variables. Scatter plots are 
sometimes called correlation plots because they show 
how two variables are correlated. Additionally, the size, 
shape or color of the dot could represent a third (or even 
fourth variable).

notes 4.4.5 Plotting Quartiles and Box plot

Suppose an entrance examination of 200 marks is 
conducted at the national level, and Mahi has topped 
the exam by scoring 120 marks. The result shows 100 
percentile against Mahi’s name, which means all the 
candidates excluding Mahi have scored less than Mahi. 
To visualise this kind of data, we use quartiles.

Quartiles are the measures which divide the data 
into four equal parts, and each part contains an equal 
number of observations. Calculating quartiles requires 
calculation of median. Quartiles are often used in 
educational achievement data, sales and survey data 
to divide populations into groups. For example, you can 
use Quartile to find the top 25 percent of students in 
that examination.

A Box Plot is the visual representation of the 
statistical summary of a given data set. The summary 
includes Minimum value, Quartile 1, Quartile 2, Median, 
Quartile 4 and Maximum value.  The whiskers are the 
two lines outside the box that extend to the highest and

4.4.6 Plotting Pie Chart

Pie is a type of graph in which a circle is divided into 
different sectors and each sector represents a part of 
the whole. A pie plot is used to represent numerical 
data proportionally. To plot a pie chart, either column 
label y or 'subplots=True' should be set while using 
df.plot(kind='pie') . If no column reference is passed and 
subplots=True, a 'pie' plot is drawn for each numerical 
column independently. 

In the Program 4.16, we have a DataFrame with 
information about the planet's mass and radius. The 
‘mass’ column is passed to the plot() function to get a 
pie plot as shown in Figure 4.20.

Summary

• A plot is a graphical representation of a data set 
which is also interchangeably known as a graph or 
chart. It is used to show the relationship between 
two or more variables.

• In order to be able to use Python’s Data 
Visualisation library, we need to import the 
pyplot module from Matplotlib library using the 
following statement: import matplotlib.pyplot as 
plt, where plt is an alias or an alternative name 
for matplotlib.pyplot. You can keep any alias of 
your choice.

• The pyplot module houses functions to create a 
figure(plot), create a plotting area in a figure, plot 
lines, bars, hist. etc., in a plotting area, decorate 
the plot with labels, etc.

5.2 types of networks

There are various types of computer networks ranging 
from network of handheld devices (like mobile phones 
or tablets) connected through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth within 
a single room to the millions of computers spread across 
the globe. Some are connected wireless while others are 
connected through wires.

Based on the geographical area covered and 
data transfer rate, computer networks are broadly 
categorised as:
•	 LAN (Local Area Network)
•	 MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
•	 WAN (Wide Area Network)

provide the short range communication with the high 
speed data transfer rates. These types of networks can 
be extended up to 1 km. Data transfer in LAN is quite 
high, and usually varies from 10 Mbps (called Ethernet)

5.3.2 Ethernet Card

Ethernet card, also known as 
Network Interface Card (NIC 
card in short) is a network 
adaptor used to set up a 
wired network. It acts as an 
interface between computer 
and the network. It is a 
circuit board mounted on the 
motherboard of a computer 
as shown in Figure 5.7. The 
Ethernet cable connects the 
computer to the network 
through NIC. Ethernet cards 
can support data transfer 
between 10 Mbps and 1 Gbps 
(1000 Mbps). Each NIC has 
a MAC address, which helps 
in uniquely identifying the Figure 5.7: A Network Interface Card 

computer on the network.

5.3.3 Repeater

Data are carried in the form of signals over the cable. 
These	 signals	 can	 travel	 a	 specified	 distance	 (usually	
about 100 m). Signals lose their strength beyond this 
limit and become weak. In such conditions, original 
signals need to be regenerated.

A repeater is an analog device that works with signals 
on the cables to which it is connected. The weakened 
signal appearing on the cable is regenerated and put 
back on the cable by a repeater.

5.3.4 Hub

An Ethernet hub (Figure 5.8) is a network device used 
to connect different devices through wires. Data arriving 
on any of the lines 
are sent out on all 
the others. The 
limitation of hub 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

is that if data from 
two devices come 
at the same time, 
they will collide. Figure 5.8: A network hub with 8 ports

notes 5.3.5 Switch

A switch is a networking device (Figure 5.9) that plays a 
central role in a Local Area Network (LAN). Like a hub, a 
network switch is used to connect multiple computers or 
communicating devices. When data arrives, the switch 
extracts the destination address from the data packet 
and looks it up in a table to see where to send the packet. 
Thus it sends signals to only selected devices instead of 
sending to all. It can forward multiple packets at the 
same time. A switch does not forward the signals which 
are noisy or corrupted. It drops such signals and asks 
the sender to resend it. 

Figure 5.9: Cables connected to a network switch

Ethernet	switches	are	common	in	homes	and	offices	
to connect multiple devices, thus creating LANs or to 
access the Internet.

5.3.6 Router

A router (Figure 5.10) is a network device that can receive 
the data, analyse it and transmit it to other networks. 
A router connects a local area network to the internet. 
Compared to a hub or a switch, a router has advanced 
capabilities as it can analyse the data being carried over 
a network, decide or alter how it is packaged, and send 
it to another network of a different type. For example, 
data has been divided into packets of a certain size. 
Suppose, these packets are to be carried over a different 
type of network which cannot handle bigger packets, 
in such a case, the data is to be repackaged as smaller 
packets and then sent over the network by a router.

devices. Usually, such routers also contain some ports 
to provide wired Internet access. These days, home 
Wi-Fi routers perform the dual task of a router and a 
modem or switch. These routers connect to incoming 
broadband lines, from ISP (Internet Service Provider), 
and convert them to digital data for computing devices 
to process.

5.3.7 Gateway

As the term “Gateway” suggests, it is a key access point 
that acts as a “gate” between an organisation's network 
and the outside world of the Internet (Figure 5.11). 
Gateway serves as the entry and exit point of a network, 
as all data coming in or going out of a network must 
first	pass	through	the	gateway	in	order	to	use	routing	
paths. Besides routing data packets, gateways also 
maintain information about the host network's internal 
connection	 paths	 and	 the	 identified	 paths	 of	 other	
remote networks. If a node from one network wants to 
communicate with a node of a foreign network, it will 
pass the data packet to the gateway, which then routes 
it to the destination using the best possible route. 

For simple Internet connectivity at homes, the 
gateway is usually the Internet Service Provider that Activity 5.3

5.4 networkIng topologIes

We have already discussed that a number of computing 
devices are connected together to form a Local Area 
Network (LAN), and interconnections among millions of 
LANs forms the Internet. The arrangement of computers 
and other peripherals in a network is called its topology. 
Common network topologies are mesh, ring, bus, star 
and tree.

5.4.1 Mesh Topology

In this networking topology, each communicating device 
is connected with every other device in the network as 
shown in Figure 5.12. Such a network can handle large 
amounts	 of	 traffic	 since	multiple	 nodes	 can	 transmit	
data simultaneously. Also, such networks are more 
reliable in the sense that even if a node gets down, it 
does not cause any break in the transmission of data 
between other nodes. This topology is also more secure 
as compared to other topologies because each cable 
between two nodes carries different data. However,

such networks, and there are many redundant or 
unutilised connections.

data can be transmitted in one direction only (clockwise 
or counterclockwise).

5.4.3 Bus Topology

In bus topology (Figure 5.14), each communicating 
device connects to a transmission medium, known as 
bus. Data sent from a node are passed on to the bus 
and hence are transmitted to the length of the bus in 
both directions. That means data can be received by 
any of the nodes connected to the bus. 

Bus

Figure 5.14: A bus topology

In this topology, a single backbone wire called bus 
is shared among the nodes, which makes it cheaper 
and easy to maintain. Both ring and bus topologies are 
considered to be less secure and less reliable.

case a node is down?

Star	 topology	 is	 considered	 very	 effective,	 efficient	
and fast as each device is directly connected with the 
central device. Although disturbance in one device 
will not affect the rest of the network, any failure in 
the central networking device may lead to the failure of 
complete network.

The central node can be either a broadcasting device 
means data will be transmitted to all the nodes in the 
network, or a unicast device means the node can identify 
the destination and forward data to that node only.

5.4.5 Tree or Hybrid Topology

It is a hierarchical topology, in which there are multiple 
branches and each branch can have one or more basic 
topologies like star, ring and bus. Such topologies are 

usually realised in WANs where 
multiple LANs are connected. 
Those LANs may be in the form 
of ring, bus or star. In Figure

connecting 4 star topologies 
in bus.

The Internet is the global network of computing devices 
including desktop, laptop, servers, tablets, mobile

devices such as printers, scanners, etc. In addition, it

also consists of networking devices such as routers, notes

switches, gateways, etc. Today, smart electronic 
appliances like TV, AC, refrigerator, fan, light, etc., 
can also communicate through the Internet. The list of 
such smart devices are always increasing e.g., drones, 
vehicles, door lock, security camera, etc.

The Internet is evolving everyday. Computers 
are either connected to a modem through a cable or 
wirelessly (Wi-Fi). A modem, be it wired or wireless, 
is connected to a local Internet Service Provider (ISP) 
who then connects to a national network. Many such 
ISPs connect together forming a regional network and 
regional networks connect together forming a national 
network, and such country-wise networks form the 
Internet backbone.

The Internet today is a widespread network, and its 
influence	is	no	longer	limited	to	the	technical	fields	of	
computer communications. It is being used by everyone 
in the society as is evident from the increasing use of 
online tools for education, creativity, entertainment, 
socialisation and e-commerce.

5.6 ApplIcAtIons of Internet

Following are some of the broad areas or services 
provided through Internet:
•	 The World Wide Web (WWW)
•	 Electronic mail (Email)
•	 Chat
•	 Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP)

5.6.1 The World Wide Web (WWW)

The World Wide Web (WWW) or web in short, is an 
ocean of information, stored in the form of trillions 
of interlinked web pages and web resources. The 
resources on the web can be shared or accessed through 
the Internet.

Earlier,	to	access	files	residing	in	different	computers,	
one had to login individually to each computer through 
the	Internet.	Besides,	files	in	different	computers	were	
sometimes	 in	different	 formats,	and	 it	was	difficult	 to	
understand	each	other’s	files	and	documents.	Sir	Tim	
Berners-Lee — a British computer scientist invented the 
revolutionary	World	Wide	Web	in	1990	by	defining	three	
fundamental technologies that lead to creation of web:

language which is used to design standardised Web 
Pages so that the Web contents can be read and 
understood from any computer across the globe. It 
uses	tags	to	define	the	way	page	content	should	be	
displayed by the web browser. Basic structure of 
every webpage is designed using HTML.

•	 URI	—	Uniform	Resource	Identifier	or	URI	is	a	unique	
identifier	 to	 identify	a	 resource	 located	on	 the	web.	
URI	identifies	a	resource	(hardware	or	software)	either	
by its location or by its name or by both. 

URL is Uniform Resource Locator and provides 
the location and mechanism (protocol) to access 
the resource. Examples of URI identifying resources 
using location (i.e., URL) are: https://www.mhrd.gov.

However, it is not only the domain name, but contains 
other information that completes a web address, as

most popular information retrieval system.

5.6.2 Electronic Mail (Email)

Email is the short form of electronic mail. It is one of 
the ways of sending and receiving message(s) using the 
Internet. An email can be sent anytime to any number 
of recipients at anywhere. The message can be either 
text entered directly onto the email application or an 
attached	file	 (text,	 image	 audio,	 video,	 etc.)	 stored	 on	
a	secondary	storage.	An	existing	file	can	be	sent	as	an	
attachment with the email, so no need to type it again. 

To use email service, one needs to register with an 
email service provider by creating a mail account. These 
services may be free or paid. Some of the popular email 
service providers are Google (gmail), Yahoo (yahoo mail), 
Microsoft (outlook), etc. However, many organisations 
nowadays get customised business email addresses for 
their staff using their own domain name. For example, 
username@companyname.com.

Following are some of the common facilities available 
for an email user:
1. Creating	 an	 email,	 attaching	 files	 with	 an	 email,	

saving an email as draft for mailing later. Creating 
email is also termed as composing. 

2. Sending and receiving mail. Same email can be sent 
to multiple email addresses, simultaneously.

3. Sending the copy of mail, as carbon copy (cc) or 
blind carbon copy (bcc).

4. Forwarding a received email to other user(s)
5. Filtering spam emails
6. Organising email in folders and sub folders
7. Creating and managing email ids of the people you 

know.
8. Setting signature/footer to be inserted automatically 

at the end of each email 
9. Printing	emails	using	a	printer	or	saving	as	files.
10. Searching emails using email address or email

5.6.3 Chat

Chatting or Instant Messaging (IM) over the Internet 
means communicating to people at different geographic 
locations in real time through text message(s). It is a 

Reprint 2025-26



152 InformatIcs PractIces

notes forum where multiple people connect to each other, 
to discuss their common interests. Two individuals 
can also send messages instantly. The sender types 
a message and sends it; the receiver immediately 
receives the message and can read and revert through 
text message. All this happens in real time, as if the 
sender and receiver were sitting in the same place. For 
a successful chat session, the communicating parties 
should be online simultaneously, and use the same 
chat application.

With ever increasing internet speed, it is now possible 
to send image, document, audio, video as well through 
instant messengers. It means, the communicating 
parties can talk to each other through an audio call or 
through a video call. Moreover, it is also possible to chat 
through text, audio and video in a group. Thus, we can 
have group chat or group calls.

Applications such as WhatsApp, Slack, Skype, Yahoo 
Messenger, Google Talk, Facebook Messenger, Google 
Hangout, etc., are examples of instant messengers. 
Some of these applications support instant messaging 
through all the modes — text, audio and video. 

5.6.4 VoIP

Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP, allows us to have 
voice call (telephone service) over the Internet, i.e., the 
voice transmission over a computer network rather 
than through the regular telephone network. It is also 
known as Internet Telephony or Broadband Telephony. 
But to avail the phone service over the Internet, we 
need to have an Internet connection with reasonably 
good speed. 

VoIP works on the simple principle of converting the 
analogue voice signals into digital and then transmitting 
them over the broadband line. There are two major 
advantages of a VoIP—
•	 These services are either free or very economical, 

so people use them to save on cost. That is why 
these days even international calls are being made 
using VoIP.

•	 VoIP call(s) can be received and made using IP phones 
from any place having Internet access. Hence, VoIP 
has increased the portability and functionality of the 
voice calling system. Incoming phone calls can be

automatically routed to the VoIP phone as soon as it notes

is connected to the Internet. 
The only disadvantage of VoIP is that its call quality is 

dependent on Internet connection speed. Slow Internet 
connection will lead to poor quality voice calls.

5.7 websIte

Each one of us might have visited one or the other 
website. A website in general contains information 
organised in multiple pages about an organisation. A 
website can also be created for a particular purpose, 
theme or to provide a service.

A website (usually referred to as a site in short) is a 
collection of web pages related through hyperlinks, and 
saved on a web server. A visitor navigates from one page 
to another by clicking on hyperlinks. Also, all the pages 
of a website are integrated under one domain name 
and have a common theme and template. For example, 
the website of NCERT will have all the pages related 
to NCERT, viz., textbooks, syllabus, events, resource 
materials, etc., under one domain name and having a 
common design theme. To access a website, one has 
to type the address of the website (URL) in the address 
bar of a browser, and press enter. The home page of the 
website will be displayed.

5.7.1 Purpose of a Website

We are living in an Internet era where the whole world 
is connected. A website’s purpose is to make the 
information available to people at large. For example, a 
company might like to advertise or sell its products, a 
government organisation may like to publish circulars, 
float	 tenders,	 invite	applications	or	 get	 feedback	 from	
various stakeholders. A website is a means that helps 
to	communicate	with	people	in	a	specific,	transparent	
and user friendly manner. Therefore, while developing 
a	website,	the	first	question	to	ask	is	why	the	website	is	
being created, and what should be its pages so that it 
serves the required purpose.

Basically, a website should be user friendly and 
provide information to users with minimum efforts. A 
website should be designed keeping in mind different 
categories of people that will be visiting the site. Some of 
the common purposes for which websites are designed 
are listed below:

•	 Selling products and delivering services
•	 Posting	and	finding	information	on	the	internet
•	 Communicating with each other
•	 Entertainment purposes
•	 Disseminating contents and software

5.8 web pAge

A web page (also referred to as a page) is a document 
on the WWW that is viewed in a web browser. Basic 
structure of a web page is created using HTML (HyperText 
Markup Language) and CSS (Cascaded Style Sheet). A 
web page is usually a part of a website and may contain 
information in different forms, such as:

Activity 5.4 ●	 text	in	the	form	of	paragraphs,	lists,	tables,	etc.
Visit NCERT, SWAYAM ●	 images
or any other website ●	 audio
and note down URLs ●	 video
of	some	of	the	specific	 ●	 software	application
pages of that website.

●	 other	interactive	contents
Additionally, various styling and formatting are 

applied on a web page to make it attractive and organised. 
Further,	program	codes	called	scripts	are	used	to	define	
the manner in which the page will behave on different 
actions. Scripts make a web page interactive. JavaScript 
is the most popular and commonly used scripting 
language. However, Python and PHP are also used to 
apply scripting on a web page.

The	first	page	of	the	website	is	called	a	home	page.	
It generally contains information and links to all the 
related web pages. Each web page has a unique address 
that is visible on the address bar. Hence if we want to 
view a particular web page, its address has to be typed in 
the address bar of the browser. The web pages that are 
linked to form a website share a unique domain name. 
For example, https://swayam.gov.in/ is a website by 
the Government of India to deliver online courses for 
School, College and University students and teachers. It 
is a collection of multiple web pages that link to different 
courses related information. 

5.8.1 Static and Dynamic Web Pages

A web page can be static or dynamic. A static webpage 
is one whose content always remains static, i.e., does 
not change for person to person. When a web server 

Reprint 2025-26



Internet and Web 155

receives a request (from browser) for a static web page, 
it just locates the page on its storage media and sends 
it to the browser of the client. No additional processing 
is performed on the page. Hence, a static web page 
remains the same for all users until someone changes 
its code manually. 

Static web pages are generally written in HTML, 
JavaScript and/or CSS and have the extension .htm 
or .html. 

STEP 1: HTTP Request
Web Web

Browser Browser

STEP 2: HTTP Response

 
Figure 5.17: Working of a static web page

On the other hand, a dynamic web page is one in 
which the content of the web page can be different for 
different users. The difference in content may be because 
of different choices made by the user. When a request for 
a dynamic web page is made to the web server, it does 
not simply retrieve the page and send. Before sending 
the requested web page, the server may perform some 
additional processes like getting information from the 
database, updating date and time, updating weather 
information, etc. The content of such pages changes 
frequently. They are more complex and thus take more 
time to load than static web pages.

Dynamic web pages can be created using various 
languages such as JavaScript, PHP, ASP.NET, Python, 
Java, Ruby, etc. These are complex to construct and 
design, as the code to perform the additional operations 
has to be added. Such server side code allows the server 
to change its content each time the page is loaded. 
Further, most dynamic pages are linked to databases 
so that each time the page is uploaded, the required 
information from the databases is retrieved to update 
the web page. Few common examples of dynamic web 
pages are those web pages displaying the date, time, 
and weather report or having e-commerce applications.

5.9 web server

A web server is used to store and deliver the contents of 
a website to clients such as a browser that request it. A 
web server can be software or hardware. 

When talking about a web server as  computer 
hardware, it stores web server software and a website's 
contents (HTML pages, images, CSS stylesheets, and 
JavaScript	files).	The	server	needs	 to	be	connected	 to	
the Internet so that its contents can be made accessible 
to others.

When talking about a web server as a software, it 
is a specialised program that understands URLs or 
web addresses coming as requests from browsers, and 
responds to those requests. The server is assigned a 
unique domain name so that it can be accessed from 
anywhere using the domain name. To develop and test 
a	website	using	a	personal	computer,	we	need	to	first	
install a web server on that computer.

The web browser from the client computer sends a 
request (HTTP request) for a page containing the desired 
data or service. The web server then accepts, interprets, 
searches and responds (HTTP response) to the request 
made by the web browser. The requested web page is 
then displayed in the browser of the client. If the server 
is not able to locate the page, it sends a page containing

the error message (Error 404 – page not found) to the 
client’s browser.

5.10 Hosting of a Website

Web hosting is a service that allows us to put a website 
or a web page onto the Internet, and make it a part of 
the World Wide Web. Once a website is created using a 
hardware server, we need to connect it to the Internet 
so that users across the globe can access. On the other 
hand, we can rent server resources (CPU, RAM, and Activity 5.5
storage) from a cloud service provider and host our locally 
created website there. This is done by uploading the Find out some of the 

files	constituting	the	website	(HTML,	CSS,	JavaScript,	 Web hosting service 

images, databases, etc.) from the local computer onto providers from both 

the space allocated on the server. For this, we have categories — free 

to avail the services of a web hosting service provider. and paid.

These services for using the server’s resources such as 
RAM, hard disk, bandwidth, etc., are usually paid and 
these resources can be increased or decreased as per 
the loads on the website.

A web server whether it is a local server or a cloud 
server when connected to the Internet is assigned 
a unique numeric address on the Internet called IP 
address. This IP address needs to be mapped to a 
textual name called domain name of the website. This 
is because it is not convenient for users to remember a 
numeric IP address. Thus, for accessing a website, the 
user	enters	the	domain	through	a	browser	(URL).	The	
domain name has to be registered (purchased) with an 
authorised agency.

5.10.1 How to host a website?

To host a website, follow the steps given below:
•	 Select	the	web	hosting	service	provider	that	will	provide	

the web server space as well as related technologies 
and services such as database, bandwidth, data 
backup,	firewall	support,	email	service,	etc.	This	has	
to be done keeping in mind the features and services 
that we want to offer through our website.

•	 Identify a domain name, which best suits our 
requirement, and get it registered through domain 
name Registrar.

•	 Once we get web space, create logins with appropriate 
rights and note down IP address to manage web space.

5.11.2 Add-Ons and Plug-ins

Add-ons and plug-ins are the tools that help to extend 
and modify the functionality of the browser. Both the 
tools boost the performance of the browser, but are 
different from each other.

A plug-in is a complete program or may be a 
third-party software. For example, Flash and Java are 
plug-ins. A Flash player is required to play a video in 
the browser. A plug-in is a software that is installed on 
the host computer and can be used by the browser for 
multiple functionalities and can even be used by other 
applications as well.

On the other hand, an add-on is not a complete program 
and so is used to add only a particular functionality to 
the browser. An add-on is also referred to as extension in 
some browsers. Adding the functionality of a sound and 
graphics card is an example of an add-on.

goods and services, all are now dependent on the use 
of computers and digital technologies. Applications 
of digital technologies have redefined and evolved all 
spheres of human activities. Today more and more people 

 
are using digital technologies through smartphones, 
computers, etc., with the help of high speed Internet. 

Why did the digital technologies become so 
widespread? The introduction of personal computers 
(PCs) and Internet followed by smartphones has brought 
these technologies to the common man. 

While we reap the benefits of digital technologies, 
these technologies can also be misused. Let’s look at 
the impact of these technologies on our society and the 
best practices that can ensure a productive and safe 
digital environment for us. 

6.2 dIgItal FootprInts

Have you ever searched online for any information? 
Have you ever purchased an online ticket, or responded 

to your friend’s email, or checked the score of a 
game online? Whenever we surf the Internet using 
smartphones, tablets, computers, etc., we leave a 
trail of data reflecting the activities performed by us 
online, which is our digital footprint. 

Our digital footprint can be created and used with 
or without our knowledge. It includes websites we 
visit, emails we send, and any information we submit 
online, etc., along with the computer’s IP address, 
location, and other device specific details. Such data 
could be used for targeted advertisement or could 
also be misused or exploited. Thus, it is good to be 
aware of the data trail we might be leaving behind. 
This awareness should make us cautious about what 
we write, upload or download or even browse online.

There are two kinds of digital footprints we leave 
behind. Active digital footprints which includes data 
that we intentionally submit online. This would 
include emails we write, or responses or posts we 
make on different websites or mobile Apps, etc. The 
digital data trail we leave online unintentionally is 
called passive digital footprints. This includes the 

Figure 6.1: Exemplar web 
applications that result in data generated when we visit a website, use a mobile

a digital footprint. With more usage, the trail grows. On 
examining the browser settings, we can find out how it Think and Reflect

and work ethics?

We may not have access to remove or erase that data, 
neither do we have any control on how that data will 
be used. Therefore, once a data trail is generated, even 
if we later try to erase data about our online activities, 
the digital footprints still remain. There is no guarantee 
that digital footprints will be fully eliminated from the 
Internet. Therefore, we need to be more cautious while 
being online! All our online activities leave a data trace 
on the Internet as well as on the computing device that 
we use. This can be used to trace the user, their location, 
device and other usage details.

6.3 dIgItal socIety and netIzen

As our society is inclined towards using more and 
more digital technologies, we end up managing most 
of our tasks digitally. In this era of digital society, our 
daily activities like communication, social networking,

using digital technologies in all spheres of human 
activities. But while online, all of us need to be aware 
of how to conduct ourselves, how best to relate with 
others and what ethics, morals and values to maintain. 
Anyone who uses digital technology along with Internet 
is a digital citizen or a netizen. Being a good netizen 
means practicing safe, ethical and legal use of digital 
technology. A responsible netizen must abide by 
net etiquettes, communication etiquettes and social 
media etiquettes.

6.3.1 Net Etiquettes

We follow certain etiquettes during our social 
interactions. Similarly, we need to exhibit proper 
manners and etiquettes while being online as shown 
in Figure 6.2. One should be ethical, respectful and 
responsible while surfing the Internet.

(A) Be Ethical 
• No copyright violation: we should not 

use copyrighted materials without the 
permission of the creator or owner. As 
an ethical digital citizen, we need to be 
careful while streaming audio or video 
or downloading images and files from 
the Internet. We will learn more about 
copyright in Section 6.4.

• Share the expertise: it is good to share 
information and knowledge on Internet 
so that others can access it. However, 
prior to sharing information, we need to 
be sure that we have sufficient knowledge 

Figure 6.2: Net etiquettes
on that topic. The information shared 
should be true and unambiguous. Also, 
in order to avoid redundant information, 
we should verify that the information is 
not available already on Internet.

Don’t feed the troll: an Internet troll is a person

starting quarrels or upsetting people, by posting 
inflammatory or off topic messages in an online 
community, just for amusement. Since trolls thrive 
on attention, the best way to discourage trolls is 
not to pay any attention to their comments.

6.3.2 Communication Etiquettes
Digital communication includes email, texting, instant 
messaging, talking on the cell phone, audio or video 
conferencing, posting on forums, social networking 
sites, etc. All these are great ways to connect with people 
in order to exchange ideas, share data and knowledge. 
Good communication over email, chat room and other 
such forums require a digital citizen to abide by the 
communication etiquettes as shown in Figure 6.3.

we decide to follow some particular person’s forum posts 
while ignoring posts of other members of the forum. On 
various discussion forums, we usually try to go through 
the previous comments of a person and judge their 
credibility before relying on that person’s comments.

6.3.3 Social Media Etiquettes
In the current digital era, we are familiar with different 
kinds social media and we may have an account on 
Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, 
or YouTube channel. Social media are websites or 
applications that enable their users to participate in 
social networking by creating and sharing content with 
others in the community. These platforms encourage 
users to share their thoughts and experiences through 
posts or pictures. In this way users can interact with 
other online users of those social media apps or channels. 
This is why the impact and outreach of social media has 
grown exponentially. It has begun to shape the outcome 
of politics, business, culture, education and more. In 
social media too, there are certain etiquettes we need to 
follow as shown in Figure 6.4.

A patent is usually granted for inventions. Unlike 
copyright, the inventor needs to apply (file) for patenting 
the invention. When a patent is granted, the owner gets 
an exclusive right to prevent others from using, selling, 
or distributing the protected invention. Patent gives full 
control to the patentee to decide whether or how the 
invention can be used by others. Thus it encourages 
inventors to share their scientific or technological 
findings with others. A patent protects an invention for

6.4.3 Violation of IPR
Violation of intellectual property right may happen in 
one of the following ways:

(A) Plagiarism 
With the availability of Internet, we can instantly copy 
or share text, pictures and videos. Presenting someone 
else’s idea or work as one’s own idea or work is called 
plagiarism. If we copy some contents from Internet, 
but do not mention the source or the original creator, 
then it is considered as an act of plagiarism. Further, if 
someone derives an idea or a product from an already 
existing idea or product, but instead presents it as a 
new idea, then also it is plagiarism. It is a serious ethical 
offense and sometimes considered as an act of fraud. 
Even if we take contents that are open for public use, 
we should cite the author or source to avoid plagiarism. 

(B)  Copyright Infringement
Copyright infringement is when we use other person’s 
work without obtaining their permission to use or we 
have not paid for it, if it is being sold. Suppose we 
download an image from the Internet and use it in our 
project. But if the owner of the copyright of the image 
does not permit its free usage, then using such an image 
even after giving reference of the image in our project is a 
violation of copyright. Just because it is on the Internet, 
does not mean that it is free for use. Hence, check the 
copyright status of writer’s work before using it to avoid 
copyright infringement.

It is used when an author wants to give people the right

licence to a software. GNU GPL is another free software 
license, which provides end users the freedom to run, 
study, share and modify the software, besides getting 
regular updates. 

Users or companies who distribute GPL licensed 
works may charge a fee for copies or give them free of 
charge. This distinguishes the GPL license from freeware 
software licenses like Skype, Adobe Acrobat reader, 
etc. that allow copying for personal use but prohibit 
commercial distribution, or proprietary licenses where 
copying is prohibited by copyright law.

Many of the proprietary software that we use are sold 
commercially and their program code (source code) are 
not shared or distributed. However, there are certain 
software available freely for anyone and their source 
code is also open for anyone to access, modify, correct

or improving the existing features. For example, Linux 
kernel-based operating systems like Ubuntu and Fedora 
come under FOSS. Some of the popular FOSS tools are 
office packages, like Libre Office, browser like Mozilla 
Firefox, etc.

Software piracy is the unauthorised use or distribution 
of software. Those who purchase a license for a copy of 
the software do not have the rights to make additional 
copies without the permission of the copyright owner. It 
amounts to copyright infringement regardless of whether 
it is done for sale, for free distribution or for copier’s 
own use. One should avoid software piracy. Using a 
pirated software not only degrades the performance of a 
computer system, but also affects the software industry 
which in turn affects the economy of a country. 

6.5 creatIve commons

Creative Commons is a non-profit organisation (https://
creativecommons.org/) that aims to build a publically

Hacking is the act of unauthorised access to a computer, 
computer network or any digital system. Hackers usually 
have technical expertise of the hardware and software. 
They look for bugs to exploit and break into the system. 

Hacking, when done with a positive intent, is called 
ethical hacking. Such ethical hackers are known as 
white hat hackers. They are specialists in exploring 
any vulnerability or loophole by during testing of the 
software. Thus, they help in improving the security of 
a software. An ethical hacker may exploit a website in 
order to discover its security loopholes or vulnerabilities. 
He then reports his findings to the website owner. Thus, 
ethical hacking is actually preparing the owner against 
any cyber attack.

A non-ethical hacker is the one who tries to gain 
unauthorised access to computers or networks in order 
to steal sensitive data with the intent to damage or 
bring down systems. They are called black hat hackers 
or crackers. Their primary focus is on security cracking 
and data stealing. They use their skill for illegal or 
malicious purposes. Such hackers try to break through 
system securities for identity theft, monetary gain, to 
bring a competitor or rival site down, to leak sensitive

is fake. They will often use logo’s of the original, making 
them difficult to detect from the real! Phishing attempts 
through phone calls or text messages are also common 
these days.

(A) Identity Theft
Identity thieves increasingly use personal information 
stolen from computers or computer networks, to commit 
fraud by using the data gained unlawfully. A user’s 
identifiable personal data like demographic details, 
email ID, banking credentials, passport, PAN, Aadhaar 
number and various such personal data are stolen and

which the criminal takes advantage of an individual’s with the cyber cell in

• Financial identity theft: when the stolen identity is 
used for financial gain.

• Criminal identity theft: criminals use a victim’s 
stolen identity to avoid detection of their 
true identity.

• Medical identity theft: criminals can seek medical 
drugs or treatment using a stolen identity.

6.6.3 Ransomware
This is another kind of cyber crime where the attacker 
gains access to the computer and blocks the user from 
accessing, usually by encrypting the data. The attacker 
blackmails the victim to pay for getting access to the 
data, or sometimes threatens to publish personal and 
sensitive information or photographs unless a ransom 
is paid.

Ransomware can get downloaded when the users 
visit any malicious or unsecure websites or download 
software from doubtful repositories. Some ransomware 
are sent as email attachments in spam mails. It can 
also reach our system when we click on a malicious 
advertisement on the Internet.

6.6.4 Combatting and Preventing Cyber Crime

6.8 e-waste: hazards and management

E-waste or Electronic waste includes electric or 
electronic gadgets and devices that are no longer in use. 
Hence, discarded computers, laptops, mobile phones, 
televisions, tablets, music systems, speakers, printers, 
scanners etc. constitute e-waste when they are near or 
end of their useful life.

E-waste is becoming one of the fastest growing 
environmental hazards in the world today.  The 
increased use of electronic equipment has also caused 
an exponential increase in the number of discarded 
products. Lack of awareness and appropriate skill 
to manage it has further worsened the problem. So, Leaching is the 

process of removing 
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is a substance from 
becoming a major concern for all countries across the another substance 
world. Globally, e-waste constitutes more than 5 per by passing water

important that e-waste is disposed of in such a manner 
that it causes minimum damage to the environment 
and society.  

6.8.1 Impact of e-waste on environment
To some extent, e-waste is responsible for the degradation 
of our environment. Whether it is emission of gases and 
fumes into the atmosphere, discharge of liquid waste 
into drains or disposal of solid e-waste materials, all of 

Reprint 2025-26



184 InformatIcs PractIces

this contributes to environmental pollution in some way 
or the other. 

When e-waste is carelessly thrown or dumped in 
landfills or dumping grounds, certain elements or 
metals used in production of electronic products cause 
air, water and soil pollution. This is because when these 
products come in contact with air and moisture, they 
tend to leach. As a result, the harmful chemicals seep 
into the soil, causing soil pollution. Further, when these 
chemicals reach and contaminate the natural ground 
water, it causes water pollution as the water becomes 
unfit for humans, animals and even for agricultural use. 
When dust particles loaded with heavy metals enters 
the atmosphere, it causes air pollution as well. 

6.8.2 Impact of e-waste on humans
As mentioned before, the electrical or electronic devices 
are manufactured using certain metals and elements 
like lead, beryllium, cadmium, plastics, etc. Most of 
these materials are difficult to recycle and are considered 
to be toxic and carcinogenic. If e-waste is not disposed 

Carcinogenic: May of in proper manner, it can be extremely harmful to 
cause cancer humans, plants, animals and the environment as 

discussed below:

• One of the most widely used metals in electronic 
devices (such as monitors and batteries) is lead. 
When lead enters the human body through 
contaminated food, water, air or soil, it causes lead 
poisoning which affects the kidneys, brain and 
central nervous system. Children are particularly 
vulnerable to lead poisoning.

• When e-waste such as electronic circuit boards are 
burnt for disposal, the elements contained in them 
create a harmful chemical called beryllium which 
causes skin diseases, allergies and an increased 
risk of lung cancer. Burning of insulated wires to 
extract copper can cause neurological disorders.

• Some of the electronic devices contain mercury 
which causes respiratory disorders and 
brain damage.

• The cadmium found in semiconductors and 
resistors can damage kidneys, liver and bones. 

• None of the electronic devices are manufactured 
without using plastics. When this plastic reacts

 Societal impactS 185

with air and moisture, it passes harmful chemicals 
into the soil and water resources. When consumed, 
it damages the immune system of the body and also 
causes various psychological problems like stress 
and anxiety.

6.8.3 Management of e-waste
E-waste management is the efficient disposal of e-waste. 
Although we cannot completely destroy e-waste, still 
certain steps and measures have to be taken to reduce 
harm to the humans and environment. Some of the 
feasible methods of e-waste management are reduce, 
reuse and recycle. 

• Reduce: We should try to reduce the generation of 
e-waste by purchasing the electronic or electrical 
devices only according to our need. Also, they 
should be used to their maximum capacity and 
discarded only after their useful life has ended. 
Good maintenance of electronics devices also 
increases the life of the devices. 

• Reuse: It is the process of re-using the electronic 
or electric waste after slight modification. The 
electronic equipment that is still functioning should 
be donated or sold to someone who is still willing to 
use it. The process of re-selling old electronic goods 
at lower prices is called refurbishing.

• Recycle: Recycling is the process of conversion of 
electronic devices into something that can be used 
again and again in some or the other manner. Only 
those products should be recycled that cannot 
be repaired, refurbished or re-used. To promote 
recycling of e-waste many companies and NGOs 
are providing door-to-door pick up facilities for 
collecting the e-waste from homes and offices.

6.8.4 E-waste Management in India
In India, the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, has Think and Reflect
been enacted to punish people responsible for causing

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has 
issued a formal set of guidelines for proper handling 
and disposal of e-waste. According to these guidelines, 
the manufacturer of any electronic equipment will be 
“personally” responsible for the final safe disposal of the 
product when it becomes an e-waste.

The Department of Information Technology (DIT),

 7 Project Based Learning

“An idea that is developed and put 
into action is more important than 
idea that exists only as an idea.”

—  Gautam Buddha

In this chapter

problem upon which the project is based. » Teamwork
Through project based learning, students » Project Descriptions
learn to organise their project and use their 
time effectively for successful completion of 
the project. Projects are developed generally 
in groups where students can learn various 
skills such as working together, problem 
solving, decision making, and investigating 
activities. Project based learning involves 
the steps such as analysing the problem, 
formulating the problem into small modules, 
applying the mechanism or method to solve 
each module and then integrating the solution 

Reprint 2025-26

notes of all the modules to arrive at the complete solution of 
the problem. To solve a problem it is required that those 
who work on it gather the relevant data and process it by 
applying a particular method. Data may be collected as 

 
per the requirement of the project in a particular format. 
All the team members should associate themselves to 
accomplish the task. After collecting the data, it should 
be processed to solve the problem. The results should 
be reported in a predetermined format. 

7.2 ApproAches for solvIng projects

The approach followed for the development and 
completion of a project plays a pivotal role in project-
based learning. There are several approaches to execute 
a project such as modular approach, top down approach 
and bottom up approach. A structured or a modular 
approach to a project means that a project is divided 
into various manageable modules, and each of the 
modules has a well-defined task to be performed with a 
set of inputs. This would lead to a set of outputs which 
when integrated leads to the desired outcome.

Different steps involved in Project Based Learning 
(Figure 7.1) are: 

(1) Identification of a project: The project idea may 
come through any real life situation. For example, one 
could think of doing a project for organising a seminar. 
One needs to understand the usefulness of the project 
and its impact. Students must be encouraged to 
undertake interdisciplinary projects. 

(2) Defining a plan: Normally for any kind of project, 
there are several project members involved in it. One 
project leader has to be identified. The roles of project 
leader and each project member have to be clearly 
defined. Students who are performing a project must 
be assigned with specific activities. The various tools 
for executing these activities must be known. To obtain 
a better solution, one should always think of the 
extreme situations. 

(3) Fixing of a time frame and processing: Every 
project is a time relevance project. A student must 
understand the importance of time frame for completion 
of the project. All the activities which are performed in 
the projects require a certain amount of time. Every 

Reprint 2025-26

project must be well structured and at the same time it 
must be flexible in its time frame.

Identification

Fixing time frame Guidance and
and processing monitoring

Figure 7.1: Steps in project based learning

(4) Providing guidance and monitoring a project: 
Many times, the participants in the project get stuck 
up with a particular process and it becomes impossible 
to proceed further. In such a case, they need guidance, 
which can be obtained from various resources such 
as books, websites and experts in the field. While 
it is essential that the project leader should ensure 
monitoring of the project, the guide teacher also helps 
in monitoring the project. 

(5) Outcome of a project: One needs to understand 
thoroughly the outcome of a project. The outcome can 
be single, or it can be multiple. The output of a project 
can be peer reviewed and can be modified as per the 
feedback from the guide teacher or other users.

7.3 teAmwork

Many real life tasks are very complex and require a lot 
of individuals to contribute in achieving them. An effort 
made collectively by individuals to accomplish a task is 
called teamwork. 

For example, in many sports, there is a team of 
players. These players play together to win a match. 
Take an example of a cricket team. We find that even if 
a bowler bowls a good ball, but if the fielder cannot take 
a catch then a wicket cannot be taken. So, in order to 
take a catch, efforts of a bowler as well as of the fielders 

Reprint 2025-26



198 InformatIcs PractIces

notes are needed. To win a cricket match, contributions from 
all the team members in all the three areas — batting, 
bowling and fielding are required.
7.3.1 Components of Teamwork

Apart from technical proficiency, a wide variety of other 
components make a successful teamwork. It comprises 
skilled team members with specific roles to achieve the 
goal. 

(A) Communicate with Others 
When a group of individuals perform one job, it is 
necessary to have effective communication between 
the members of the team. Such communication can 
be done via e-mails, telephones, or by arranging group 
meetings. This helps the team members to understand 
each other and sort out their problems to achieve the 
goal effectively. 

(B) Listen to Others 
It is necessary to understand the ideas of others while 
executing a job together. This can be achieved when the 
team members listen to each other in group meetings, 
and follow steps that are agreed upon. 

(C) Share with Others
Ideas, images and tools need to be shared with each 
other in order to perform a job. Sharing is an important 
component of teamwork. Any member of the team who is 
well versed in a certain area should share the expertise 
and experience with others to effectively achieve the 
goal within the time frame. 

(D) Respect for Others 
Every member of the team must be treated respectfully. 
All the thoughts and ideas that are put forth in the 
group meetings may be respected and duly considered. 
Not respecting the views of a particular member may 
cause problems and that particular team member may 
not give his best. 

(E) <L3>Help Others 
A helping hand from every member is a key to success. 
Sometimes, help from people who are not a part of the 
team is also obtained in order to accomplish a job. 

(F) Participate 
All the team members must be encouraged by each 
other to participate in completing the project and also 

Reprint 2025-26



Project Based Learning 199

in discussions in group meetings. Also, every member notes

should take an active participation so that they feel 
their importance in the team.

7.4 project descrIptIons

In this section, some examples of project works are 
given, which can be taken up in groups under project 
based learning. However, a group may choose any other 
project in consultation with the guide teacher.

7.4.1 Project I : Online Shopping Platform 

Description
Murugan plans to launch an online shopping platform—
‘APPAREL EASY’. He plans to have two broad categories 
of merchandise—Men, Women.  Under both the 
categories— Clothing, Footwear and Accessories will be 
the sub-categories. Also, on his shopping platform, he 
is planning to launch two mega events— Festive Sale (a 
month before Diwali to Christmas), End of Season Sale 
(February and August). Murugan also wants to keep 
a record of his monthly revenue generation sales and 
category wise sales, with special focus on mega events. 
A record should also be kept on discounts being offered 
by the manufacturers, payment sites or any discount 
offered as a promotional campaign by the APPAREL 
EASY portal.

Specification
The details of the Men and Women apparels should be 
stored in a data file with fields as Apparel Code, Name, 
Category, Size, Price, Customer Name, Payment Mode, 
Discount Code, etc.

If the Category is Men, then apparels can be Men’s 
Trousers, Men’s Shirt, Men’s Jeans, Men’s T-shirt. If the 
Category is Women, then the apparels can be Skirts, 
Top, Pants, Jeans, Kurta, etc.

If the Payment Mode is Credit or Debit Card, then 
the Credit card number, name, CVV and validity should 
be entered.

If the Payment Mode is Cash on Delivery(COD), then 
no details to be asked.

Randomly select the merchandise to be put on sale. 
The selected merchandise should not be more than 70 
per cent of the total merchandise.

Reprint 2025-26



200 InformatIcs PractIces

notes The discount code can be either FEST (for Festive) or 
EOS (for End of Season). The discounts for FEST will be 
10 per cent and for EOS will be 15 per cent.
You need to visualise the data structure, keeping all the 
requirements of Murugan in mind, and then implement 
it using Python Pandas. Thereafter, you need to design a 
software to store details of the merchandise to put them 
online for sale. At the same time, records of customers 
visiting the e-commerce site and the number of 
customers placing the order also have to be maintained. 
The data collected should be plotted appropriately to 
help Murugan make decisions for future marketing and 
promotion strategies.

7.4.2 Project II: Automating a Books Donation Camp 

Description
Realising the importance of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, 
the Bookworm club every year organises a Book Donation 
Camp. The Book Donation camp collects books and 
notebooks. The volunteers assess the condition of the 
books and categorise them as Fit, Needs mending, or 
Unfit. The unfit books’ pages are used to create paper 
bags and envelopes. The other categories of books are 
resold at half the price. They accept notebooks that 
have pages left in them. The pages are torn from the 
notebooks, and are attractively bound to create a new 
notebook and sold. They create a variety of recycled 
objects and sell them. They want to create a software 
for this purpose and store details about the camp. To be 
able to efficiently store, retrieve and visualise data, they 
need to implement the following using Pandas.

Specification
The details of collections are stored in a CSV file with 
column headings as Item category, Item ID, Item name, 
Item type, Condition.

If the Item Category is Book, then the Item Type can 
be either Academic or Non Academic, and Item Id shall 
be prefixed with a ‘B’. In case of Academic, class shall 
be entered.

If the Item Category is Notebook then the Item can 
be Single line, Four Line, Five Line, and Item Id shall be 
prefixed with an ‘N’.

Condition can only be Fit, Needs Mending or Unfit. 
After the items are refurbished, the data are stored 

Reprint 2025-26



Project Based Learning 201

in another CSV file containing the following column notes

headings: Item id, Item name, Item Category, Quantity, 
Price. Item Category can be Paper bags, Notebook, 
Books. In case of books Class is also to be entered.

Another CSV file to store orders is created that 
stores Item Category, Item name, Quantity and Price. 
In case of an order, the refurbished CSV shall update 
the quantity.

To ensure effective decision making, it is required 
that different data are plotted using appropriate plots 
to show sales, items refurbished, and items collected.

7.4.3 Project III: A survey of the effect of social 
networking sites on behaviour of teenagers 

Description
With the Internet revolution everyone today is now 
connected. Teenagersspend a good amount of time on 
social networking sites, and it plays a vital role in their 
behaviour. It is considered that excessive use of social 
networking sites has sometimes a serious impact on 
the mental health of individuals. A well-crafted survey 
questionnaire can help in exploring and finding many 
facts.

Specifications
1. Create a survey questionnaire using any of the freely 

available online tools (such as google forms) and 
store the responses in a CSV file.

2. Prepare some data analysis questions that you 
expect them to answer

3. Import the CSV file in Pandas DataFrame
4. Perform statistical computation such as mean, 

median, etc., with respect to the identified questions
5. Visualise the findings of the survey using appropriate 

charts.

Specifications
On such a large dataset, various types of questions 
can be answered by doing different analysis of data. 
Following is a list of some of the possible queries that 
can be answered by analysing the dataset:

1. What is the total population, total male population 
and total female population aged 10 to 24 in India?

2. Which State or Union Territory in India has the 
maximum number of illiterates in the youth ages?

3. What is the percentage of people working as a 
marginal worker?

4. List the top 5 states or union territories which have 
the maximum population working as a marginal 
worker.

5. Compare the sex ratio of urban areas and rural 
areas using appropriate graph.

6. Which state has the highest and the lowest 
percentage of literate Scheduled Tribes and 
Scheduled Castes?

7. For each state, compare the no. of female marginal 
workers with no. of male marginal workers. Use 
appropriate graphs.

8. What percentage of Scheduled Tribes lives in urban 
areas? Draw a pie chart showing the proportion of 
literate and illiterates scheduled tribes living in 
urban areas.

9. What is the state wise ratio of literates vs. illiterates 
in all age groups?

India? Which state has the minimum no. of ST in 
India?

11. For each state, find the no. of literate females and 
no. of literate males. Draw a bar graph for the same. 
Which state has the highest ratio of literate female 
vs literate male and which state has the minimum?

A project work can be carried out by taking any 
4–5 of the above questions and any other similar 
questions, and solving them step-by-step, with detailed 
explanation and documentation. As an example, in the 
following pages, we will solve the first question. This will 
give us an idea about how the other questions are to be 
answered.
Task 1: What is the total population, total male 
population and total female population aged 10 to 
24 in India? 

Solution:
Prerequisite: we need to first download the CSV file 
through the QR code given at the beginning of this 
chapter. 

Step 1: Read the CSV file in a DataFrame
Step 2: Check the shape of the DataFrame

Step 3: View the columns

Step 4: Filter data
a. Identify the columns that you wants to use 
for plotting
b. Identify the number of rows required for 
plotting

Step 5: Create a new DataFrame containing the filtered 
data

Step 6: Rename the columns for ease of use

Step 7: Group data as per the requirement

Step 8: Plot data as a barchart for the DataFrame 
obtained in Step 7. 

Let us now write the code for the above identified 
steps:

Step 0: Import required libraries.

Step 1: Read the CSV file in a DataFrame.
# Add path to the CSV file in your computer
data=pd.read_csv("PCA_AY_2011_Revised.csv")

df=pd.DataFrame(data)

Step 2: Check shape of the DataFrame.
print(df.shape)

We get the output showing the dataset contains 
12168 rows and 123 columns.

Step 3: Display the columns.
print(df.columns.values)

A part of the output produced for the 123 columns 
is shown below:
['Table No.' 'State Code' 'District Code' 'Area Name'

 'Total/ Rural/ Urban' 'Adolescent and youth categories'

 'Total Population - Persons' 'Total Population - Males'

 'Total Population - Females' 'Scheduled Caste - Persons'

 'Scheduled Caste - Males' 'Scheduled Caste - Females'

                     ...              

 'Scheduled Tribe Marginal Worker - Household Industry - Males'

 'Scheduled Tribe Marginal Worker - Household Industry - Females'

 'Scheduled Tribe Marginal Worker - Other Workers - Persons'

 'Scheduled Tribe Marginal Worker - Other Workers - Males'

 'Scheduled Tribe Marginal Worker - Other Workers - Females']

Step 4: Filter Data.

a. Identify the columns that you want to use for plotting.

For our analysis, we will consider only the columns 
‘Area Name’; ’Total/Rural/Urban’, 'Adolescent and 
youth categories', and 'Total Population - Persons' .

b. Identify the number of rows required for plotting.

In order to decide the number of rows, we needs to 
check the values in the column ‘Area Name
print(df[‘Area Name’]

The following is the output:

Step 5: Create a new DataFrame containing the filtered 
data.

Suppose, we want to consider data for ‘Area Name’ = 
‘INDIA’ only, Therefore, we shall create a new DataFrame 
df1 containing only the filtered data, using the following 
syntax:

df.loc[row selection, column selection] 

df1=df.loc[(df['Area Name'] == 'INDIA'), 
'Area Name':'Total Population - Females']

In the above statement, df [‘Area Name’] is used to 
select the required rows.We apply slicing on column 
labels to select the columns starting from ‘Area Name’ 
till ‘Total Population — Females’ 

Step 6: The names of the columns in the DataFrame 
are too long. The following statement can be used to 
rename the columns.

df1.columns = ['Area', 'Class', 'Category', 
'TotalPop', 'MalePop', 'FemalePop']

Step 7: Group data as per the requirement.
We decided to plot TotalPop, MalePop, FemalePopwith 

respect to Category. But, on inspecting the DataFrame 
df1 we have noticed that the Category column contains 
data under six different categories — '10-14', '15-19', 
'20-24', 'Adolescent (10-19)', 'All Ages', 'Youth (15-24)'.

Therefore, to plot TotalPop, MalePop, FemalePop, we 
should do grouping of these six categories and find the 
sum for each type of population. This will help to provide 
a complete picture. The GROUP BY() function when 
applied on the column ‘Category’ on our DataFrame 
df1, gives us the following result:

d = df1.GROUP BY('Category').sum()

We are interested only in the categories ‘10-14’, ‘15-

the following Python statement:
