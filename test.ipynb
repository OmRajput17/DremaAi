This description of a\\nchemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a\\nshorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a\\nword-equation.\\nThe word-equation for the above reaction would be –\\nMagnesium + Oxygen\\n(Reactants)\\n\\n→ Magnesium oxide\\n\\n(1.1)\\n\\n(Product)\\n\\nThe substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),\\nmagnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is\\nmagnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.\\nA word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an\\narrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand\\nside (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are\\nwritten on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.\\nThe arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of\\nthe reaction.\\n\\nScience\\n\\n2\\n\\nReprint 2025-26\\n\\n\\x0c1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation\\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?\\nChemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –\\nMg + O2 → MgO\\n\\n(1.2)\\n\\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\\nLHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the\\nsame on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced.

Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air.\\n\\n1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.\\nIn other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.\\nThe word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as –\\nZinc + Sulphuric acid → Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen\\nThe above word-equation may be represented by the following\\nchemical equation –\\nZn + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2\\n\\n(1.3)\\n\\nLet us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both\\nsides of the arrow.\\nElement\\n\\nNumber of atoms in\\nreactants (LHS)\\n\\nNumber of atoms\\nin products (RHS)\\n\\nZn\\nH\\nS\\nO\\n\\n1\\n2\\n1\\n4\\n\\n1\\n2\\n1\\n4\\n\\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.\\nLet us try to balance the following chemical equation –\\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\\n\\n(1.4)\\n\\n3\\n\\nChemical Reactions and Equations\\n\\nReprint 2025-26\\n\\n\\x0cStep I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\\nformula.

It may be a reactant or a\\nproduct. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum\\nnumber of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element\\noxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on\\nthe LHS.\\nTo balance the oxygen atoms –\\nAtoms of\\noxygen\\n\\nIn reactants\\n\\nIn products\\n\\n(i) Initial\\n(ii) To balance\\n\\n1 (in H2O)\\n1×4\\n\\n4 (in Fe3O4)\\n4\\n\\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\\n‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation\\nbecomes –\\n(1.6)\\nFe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\\n(partly balanced equation)\\nStep IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\\nto proceed further.

(1.9) are\\nequal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical\\nequations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance\\nthe equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.\\nStep VII: Writing Symbols of Physical States Carefully examine\\nthe above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about\\nthe physical state of each reactant and product? No information has\\nbeen given in this equation about their physical states.\\nTo make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states\\nof the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical\\nformulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants\\nand products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),\\nrespectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product\\nis present as a solution in water.\\nThe balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes\\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)\\n\\n(1.10)\\n\\nNote that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this\\nreaction water is used in the form of steam.\\nUsually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless\\nit is necessary to specify them.\\nSometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,\\ncatalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow\\nin the equation. For example –\\n340 atm\\n\\n(1.11)\\n\\nCO(g) + 2H2 (g) \\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\n→ CH3 OH(l)\\nSunlight\\n\\n6CO2 (aq) + 12H2O(l) \\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\nChlorophyll → C6 H12O 6 (aq) + 6O2 (aq) + 6H2 O(l) (1.12)\\n(Glucose)\\n\\nUsing these steps, can you balance Eq.
