A\\nforce is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction.\\n\\n2. Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and\\narrived at the law of inertia.  Newton’s first law of motion is the same law rephrased\\nthus: “Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line,\\nunless compelled by some external force to act otherwise”.  In simple terms, the First Law\\nis “If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero”.\\n\\n3. Momentum (p ) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) :\\np  =  m v\\n\\n4. Newton’s second law of motion :\\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes\\nplace in the direction in which the force acts.  Thus\\n\\ndp\\nF = k = k m a\\n\\ndt\\nwhere F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We set the constant\\nof proportionality k = 1 in SI units.  Then\\n\\ndp\\nF = = ma\\n\\ndt\\nThe SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.\\n(a) The second law is consistent with the First Law (F = 0 implies a = 0)\\n(b) It is a vector equation\\n(c) It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided  F\\n\\nis the total external force on the system and a  is the acceleration of the system as\\na whole.\\n\\n(d) F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant.\\nThat is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the\\nhistory of motion.\\n\\n4. Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum.\\nThe notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a\\nmeasurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short,\\none can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during\\nthe action of the impulsive force.\\n\\n6. Newton’s third law of motion:\\nTo every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction\\n\\nReprint 2025-26\\n\\n\\n\\nLAWS OF MOTION 67\\n\\nIn simple terms, the law can be stated thus :\\nForces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies.  Force on a body A by body\\nB is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A.\\nAction and reaction forces are simultaneous forces.  There is no cause-effect\\nrelation between action and reaction.  Any of the two mutual forces can be\\ncalled action and the other reaction.  Action and reaction act on different\\nbodies and so they cannot be cancelled out.  The internal action and reaction\\nforces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero.\\n\\n7. Law of Conservation of Momentum\\nThe total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved.  The law\\nfollows from the second and third law of motion.\\n\\n8. Friction\\nFrictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two\\nsurfaces in contact.  It is the component of the contact force along the common\\ntangent to the surface in contact.  Static friction f  opposes impending relative\\n\\ns\\n\\nmotion; kinetic friction f  opposes actual relative motion. They are independent\\nk\\n\\nof the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws :\\n\\nfs ≤ ( fs ) = µ\\nma sR\\n\\nx\\n\\nf = µ R\\nk k\\n\\nµ  (co-efficient of static friction) and µ  (co-efficient of kinetic friction) are\\ns k\\n\\nconstants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact.  It is found\\nexperimentally that µ is less than µ .\\n\\nk s \\n\\nPOINTS TO PONDER\\n\\n1. Force is not always in the direction of motion.  Depending on the situation, F\\nmay be along v, opposite to v, normal to v or may make some other angle with\\nv.  In every case, it is parallel to acceleration.\\n\\n2. If v = 0 at an instant, i.e. if a body is momentarily at rest, it does not mean that\\nforce or acceleration are necessarily zero at that instant.  For example, when a\\nball thrown upward reaches its maximum height, v = 0 but the force continues\\nto be its weight mg and the acceleration is not zero but g.\\n\\n3. Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of\\nthe body at that time.  Force is not ‘carried’ by the body from its earlier history of\\nmotion.  The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train, there is\\nno horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding\\nair are neglected.  The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity.\\n\\n4. In the second law of motion F = m a, F stands for the net force due to all\\nmaterial agencies external to the body.  a is the effect of the force.  ma should\\nnot be regarded as yet another force, besides F.\\n\\nReprint 2025-26\\n\\n\\n\\n68 PHYSICS\\n\\n5. The centripetal force should not be regarded as yet another kind of force. It is\\nsimply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a\\nbody in circular motion. We should always look for some material force like\\ntension, gravitational force, electrical force, friction, etc as the centripetal force\\nin any circular motion.\\n\\n6. Static friction is a self-adjusting force up to its limit µ  N (f ≤ µ  N).  Do not put\\ns s s\\n\\nf = µ N  without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming\\ns s  \\n\\ninto play.\\n7. The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in\\n\\nequilibrium.  The two forces mg and R can be different (e.g. a body in an\\naccelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third\\nlaw.\\n\\n8. The terms ‘action’ and ‘reaction’ in the third Law of Motion simply stand for\\nsimultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in\\nordinary language, action does not precede or cause reaction.  Action and reaction\\nact on different bodies.\\n\\n9. The different terms like ‘friction’, ‘normal reaction’ ‘tension’, ‘air resistance’,\\n‘viscous drag’, ‘thrust’, ‘buoyancy’, ‘weight’, ‘centripetal force’ all stand for ‘force’\\nin different contexts.  For clarity, every force and its equivalent terms\\nencountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase ‘force on A by B’.\\n\\n10. For applying the second law of motion, there is no conceptual distinction between\\ninanimate and animate objects.  An animate object such as a human also\\nrequires an external  force to accelerate.  For example, without the external\\nforce of friction, we cannot walk on the ground.\\n\\n11.

A\\nforce is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction.\\n\\n2. Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and\\narrived at the law of inertia.  Newton’s first law of motion is the same law rephrased\\nthus: “Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line,\\nunless compelled by some external force to act otherwise”.  In simple terms, the First Law\\nis “If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero”.\\n\\n3. Momentum (p ) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) :\\np  =  m v\\n\\n4. Newton’s second law of motion :\\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes\\nplace in the direction in which the force acts.  Thus\\n\\ndp\\nF = k = k m a\\n\\ndt\\nwhere F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We set the constant\\nof proportionality k = 1 in SI units.  Then\\n\\ndp\\nF = = ma\\n\\ndt\\nThe SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.\\n(a) The second law is consistent with the First Law (F = 0 implies a = 0)\\n(b) It is a vector equation\\n(c) It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided  F\\n\\nis the total external force on the system and a  is the acceleration of the system as\\na whole.\\n\\n(d) F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant.\\nThat is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the\\nhistory of motion.\\n\\n4. Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum.\\nThe notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a\\nmeasurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short,\\none can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during\\nthe action of the impulsive force.\\n\\n6. Newton’s third law of motion:\\nTo every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction\\n\\nReprint 2025-26\\n\\n\\n\\nLAWS OF MOTION 67\\n\\nIn simple terms, the law can be stated thus :\\nForces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies.  Force on a body A by body\\nB is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A.\\nAction and reaction forces are simultaneous forces.  There is no cause-effect\\nrelation between action and reaction.  Any of the two mutual forces can be\\ncalled action and the other reaction.  Action and reaction act on different\\nbodies and so they cannot be cancelled out.  The internal action and reaction\\nforces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero.\\n\\n7. Law of Conservation of Momentum\\nThe total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved.  The law\\nfollows from the second and third law of motion.\\n\\n8. Friction\\nFrictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two\\nsurfaces in contact.  It is the component of the contact force along the common\\ntangent to the surface in contact.  Static friction f  opposes impending relative\\n\\ns\\n\\nmotion; kinetic friction f  opposes actual relative motion. They are independent\\nk\\n\\nof the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws :\\n\\nfs ≤ ( fs ) = µ\\nma sR\\n\\nx\\n\\nf = µ R\\nk k\\n\\nµ  (co-efficient of static friction) and µ  (co-efficient of kinetic friction) are\\ns k\\n\\nconstants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact.  It is found\\nexperimentally that µ is less than µ .\\n\\nk s \\n\\nPOINTS TO PONDER\\n\\n1. Force is not always in the direction of motion.  Depending on the situation, F\\nmay be along v, opposite to v, normal to v or may make some other angle with\\nv.  In every case, it is parallel to acceleration.\\n\\n2. If v = 0 at an instant, i.e. if a body is momentarily at rest, it does not mean that\\nforce or acceleration are necessarily zero at that instant.  For example, when a\\nball thrown upward reaches its maximum height, v = 0 but the force continues\\nto be its weight mg and the acceleration is not zero but g.\\n\\n3. Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of\\nthe body at that time.  Force is not ‘carried’ by the body from its earlier history of\\nmotion.  The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train, there is\\nno horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding\\nair are neglected.  The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity.\\n\\n4. In the second law of motion F = m a, F stands for the net force due to all\\nmaterial agencies external to the body.  a is the effect of the force.  ma should\\nnot be regarded as yet another force, besides F.\\n\\nReprint 2025-26\\n\\n\\n\\n68 PHYSICS\\n\\n5. The centripetal force should not be regarded as yet another kind of force. It is\\nsimply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a\\nbody in circular motion. We should always look for some material force like\\ntension, gravitational force, electrical force, friction, etc as the centripetal force\\nin any circular motion.\\n\\n6. Static friction is a self-adjusting force up to its limit µ  N (f ≤ µ  N).  Do not put\\ns s s\\n\\nf = µ N  without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming\\ns s  \\n\\ninto play.\\n7. The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in\\n\\nequilibrium.  The two forces mg and R can be different (e.g. a body in an\\naccelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third\\nlaw.\\n\\n8. The terms ‘action’ and ‘reaction’ in the third Law of Motion simply stand for\\nsimultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in\\nordinary language, action does not precede or cause reaction.  Action and reaction\\nact on different bodies.\\n\\n9. The different terms like ‘friction’, ‘normal reaction’ ‘tension’, ‘air resistance’,\\n‘viscous drag’, ‘thrust’, ‘buoyancy’, ‘weight’, ‘centripetal force’ all stand for ‘force’\\nin different contexts.  For clarity, every force and its equivalent terms\\nencountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase ‘force on A by B’.\\n\\n10. For applying the second law of motion, there is no conceptual distinction between\\ninanimate and animate objects.  An animate object such as a human also\\nrequires an external  force to accelerate.  For example, without the external\\nforce of friction, we cannot walk on the ground.\\n\\n11. The objective concept of force in physics should not be confused with the\\nsubjective concept of the ‘feeling of force’.  On a merry-go-around, all parts of\\nour body are subject to an  inward force,  but we have a feeling of being pushed\\noutward – the direction of impending motion.\\n\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n(For simplicity in numerical calculations, take g = 10 m s-2)\\n4.1 Give the magnitude and direction of the net force acting on\\n\\n(a) a drop of rain falling down with a constant speed,\\n(b) a cork of mass 10 g floating  on water,\\n(c) a kite skillfully held stationary in the sky,\\n(d) a car moving with a constant velocity of 30 km/h on a rough road,\\n(e) a high-speed electron in space far from all material objects, and free of\\n\\nelectric and magnetic fields.\\n4.2 A  pebble of mass 0.05 kg is thrown vertically upwards.

      "   B. 8 m s-1\n",
      "   C. 16 m s-1\n",
      "   D. 32 m s-1\n",
      "\n",
      "   ✓ Correct Answer: A\n",
      "   💡 Explanation: Using conservation of momentum, the recoil speed of the gun can be calculated as v_g = m_s * v_s / m_g, where m_s is the mass of the shell, v_s is the muzzle speed of the shell, and m_g is the mass of the gun.\n",

      "   C. 0.67 m s-2\n",
      "   D. 1.25 m s-2\n",
      "\n",
      "   ✓ Correct Answer: C\n",
      "   💡 Explanation: Using Newton's second law, F = m * a, the acceleration of the body can be calculated as a = F / m = 8.0 N / 0.40 kg = 20 m s-2. However, this is the acceleration due to the force, not the net acceleration. Since the force is directed towards the south, the body will accelerate in the opposite direction, resulting in an acceleration of a = -20 m s-2. However, the question asks for the magnitude of the acceleration, which is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the x and y components of the acceleration. Since the acceleration is purely in the y-direction, the magnitude of the acceleration is a = sqrt((-20 m s-2)^2) = 20 m s-2. However, this is the acceleration due to the force, not the net acceleration. Since the force is directed towards the south, the body will accelerate in the opposite direction, resulting in an acceleration of a = 0.67 m s-2.\n",

      "   C. 90 kg\n",
      "   D. 100 kg\n",
      "\n",
      "   ✓ Correct Answer: D\n",
      "   💡 Explanation: Using the equation for the normal force exerted by the scale on the man, F_N = m * (g + a), where m is the mass of the man, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and a is the acceleration of the lift, the reading on the scale can be calculated as F_N = 70 kg * (9.8 m s-2 + 5 m s-2) = 994 N. The reading on the scale is given by the mass of the man that would produce this normal force, which is m = F_N / (g + a) = 994 N / (9.8 m s-2 + 5 m s-2) = 100 kg.\n",

      "Q5. A horse cannot pull a cart and run in empty space because the horse's muscles exert a force on the cart, but the cart also exerts an equal and opposite force on the horse, resulting in a net force of zero. This means that the horse and cart will not accelerate relative to each other. However, the horse's muscles are also exerting a force on the horse itself, which causes the horse to accelerate in the opposite direction. This is why the horse cannot pull the cart and run in empty space.\n",
      "   A. This is because the horse's muscles are not strong enough\n",
      "   B. This is because the horse is not able to generate enough force\n",
      "   C. This is because the horse and cart are not able to accelerate relative to each other\n",
      "   D. This is because the horse's muscles exert a force on the cart, but the cart also exerts an equal and opposite force on the horse\n",

      "Q1. A cyclist is taking a circular turn with a constant speed of 5 m/s. If the radius of the turn is 3 m and the coefficient of friction between the tyre and the road is 0.1, what is the minimum speed required to avoid slipping?\n",
      "   A. 18 km/h\n",
      "   B. 20 km/h\n",
      "   C. 22 km/h\n",
      "   D. 25 km/h\n",
      "\n",
      "   ✓ Correct Answer: D\n",
      "   💡 Explanation: To avoid slipping, the centripetal force (F_c) must be greater than or equal to the maximum static frictional force (F_s). F_c = (m * v^2) / r, F_s = mu * N. Since the speed is constant, the force of friction is maximum when the body is about to slip. Therefore, F_c = F_s, and we can find the minimum speed required to avoid slipping.\n",

      "Q2. A stone is thrown horizontally from the top of a cliff with an initial speed of 10 m/s. If the cliff is 20 m high, what is the time taken by the stone to hit the ground?\n",
      "   A. 0.5 s\n",
      "   B. 1 s\n",
      "   C. 1.5 s\n",
      "   D. 2 s\n",
      "\n",
      "   ✓ Correct Answer: D\n",
      "   💡 Explanation: Since the stone is thrown horizontally, the vertical component of the velocity remains constant. We can use the equation for free fall to find the time taken by the stone to hit the ground: h = (1/2) * g * t^2, where h is the height of the cliff and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n",

      "\n",
      "   ✓ Correct Answer: D\n",
      "   💡 Explanation: We can use the equation for centripetal force to find the mass of the horse and the cart: F_c = (m * v^2) / r, where F_c is the centripetal force, m is the mass of the horse and the cart, v is the velocity, and r is the radius of the circle. We can rearrange the equation to solve for m.\n",

      "   D. 5 m/s^2\n",
      "\n",
      "   ✓ Correct Answer: D\n",
      "   💡 Explanation: We can use the equation for uniform acceleration to find the acceleration of the bus: v = u + a * t, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time. Since the bus stops suddenly, the final velocity is 0 m/s. We can rearrange the equation to solve for a.\n",
