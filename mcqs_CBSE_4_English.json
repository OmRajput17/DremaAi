      "question": "While exploring the centre of the earth, you come across a deep pool of water. What can you infer about the water's temperature?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The water is extremely cold due to the earth's core.",
        "B": "The water is warm because it's deep inside the earth.",
        "C": "The water's temperature is difficult to determine without further investigation.",
        "D": "The water is boiling hot due to the earth's intense heat."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "While it's possible that the water's temperature could be affected by the earth's core or its depth, there's not enough information available to make a definitive conclusion. Therefore, option C is the most accurate inference.",

      "question": "Imagine you are on a journey to the centre of the earth. What would be a likely consequence of reaching the centre?",
      "options": {
        "A": "You would be surrounded by intense heat and light.",
        "B": "You would find a pool of liquid metal at the centre.",
        "C": "You would reach a point where the earth's gravity becomes zero.",
        "D": "You would find a vast, empty space at the centre."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Reaching the centre of the earth would indeed mean being surrounded by the earth's core, which is made up of hot, molten metal. This would result in intense heat and light, making option A the correct answer.",

      "question": "What would you likely see as you journey deeper into the centre of the earth?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Rivers and lakes flowing with crystal-clear water",
        "B": "Increasing temperatures and a gradual decrease in pressure",
        "C": "A vast cavern filled with glittering gemstones",
        "D": "Towering mountain ranges made of solid rock"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "As you travel deeper into the earth's centre, the temperature increases due to the planet's internal heat. The pressure also increases due to the weight of the overlying rocks. This is because the earth's interior is composed of hot, viscous rock that can flow over time, creating the conditions for the formation of mountains and volcanoes.",

        "D": "A table filled with delicious food and drink"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In Lewis Carroll's classic tale, Alice in Wonderland, the strange rabbit is a catalyst for Alice's adventures. When she follows the rabbit, she enters a fantastical world where the playing cards are engaged in a lively game. This scene is a classic example of the absurdity and illogic that pervades the world of Wonderland.",
